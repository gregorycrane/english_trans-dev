          <p>IN the time of Pope Alexander II.,1 many states throughout <lb/>
            the world were a prey to severe calamities; the nations <lb/>
            plunging into furious contests to their mutual ruin. Ihis <lb/>
            was particularly the case with the western states, which <lb/>
            suffered great disasters. On the death of thoseexcellent <lb/>
            kings, Henry of France, and Edward of England, the <lb/>
            French and English had long reason to lament their loss, as <lb/>
            the princes who succeeded were little like them for virtue <lb/>
            and gentleness of disposition. When these fathers of their <lb/>
            country were removed, they were followed by tyrants who <lb/>
            abused the royal authority. England, stained by the cruel­ <lb/>
            ties and perjury of Harold, fell to decay, and deprived of its <lb/>
            race of native kings, became a prey to foreign adventurers, <lb/>
            the adherents of William the Conqueror, presenting a <lb/>
            melancholy subject for the pen of the feeling historian.</p>
          <p>Writers of learning and eloquence found ample materials <lb/>
            for several works, having lived for many years at the court <lb/>
            of King William, and had opportunities of observing all he <lb/>
            did, and the varied and illustrious events of his reign; they <lb/>
            were privy to his most secret counsels, and by his muni- <note type="footnote"> 1 September 30, 1061—April 20, 1073. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="2"/>

            gave them no pretensions. The churches he erected, or <lb/>
            which were built in his time to the glory of God, both in <lb/>
            Normandy and England, are noble monuments of his devo­ <lb/>
            tion and his liberality in providing for the service of God, <lb/>
            and have left to posterity an example worthy of their <lb/>
            imitation. His piety led him also to found a number of <lb/>
            monasteries, and to enlarge those which he and others had <lb/>
            already built, liberally endowing them with ample pos­ <lb/>
            sessions, and taking them under his protection against all <lb/>
            adversaries. The two convents he founded at Caen, the <lb/>
            one for monks the other for nuns, are special witnesses of <lb/>
            his munificence. They were both erected in honour of the <lb/>
            King Eternal, while he himself was yet a duke only, select­ <lb/>
            ing one for his own tomb, the other for that of his consort.1</p>
          <p>The war in England being terminated, his enemies having <lb/>
            submitted to his victorious arms, and the royal crown being <lb/>
            placed on his head at London, William founded at Senlac, <lb/>
            where the decisive battle was fought, the abbey of the Holy <lb/>
            Trinity,2 endowing it with revenues and domains fitting a <lb/>
            royal foundation. G-oisbert, a pious monk of Marmoutier, <lb/>
            was appointed the first abbot,3 under whose rule monastic <lb/>
            order and regular discipline were duly established. The <lb/>
            monastery at Marmoutier, begun by the most holy Martin, <lb/>
            bishop of Tours, became by God's grace an increasing semi­ <lb/>

            dedicated on the 18th of June of the same year. The foundations of the <lb/>
            abbey of St. Stephen were also laid before the conquest, through the <lb/>
            exertions of Lanfranc, who became the first abbot, but the works were <lb/>
            carried on much more slowly, and it was not consecrated until the 13th of <lb/>
            December, 1077. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This abbey has always been better known as Sanetus Martinus de <lb/>
            Bello, or Battle Abbey. William determined, notwithstanding the opposi­ <lb/>

            altar was placed on the spot where the body of Harold was found after the <lb/>
            battle, as some say, but as others, where the royal standard was taken. <lb/>
            Part of the church was built of Caen stone, until a quarry was discovered <lb/>
            in the neighbourhood. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The first abbot of Battle was not Goisbert, but Robert Blancard, who <lb/>

            sanctity and virtues numbers were benefited, and whose <lb/>
            fame was diffused not only throughout the neighbourhood, <lb/>
            but in foreign countries. After Goisbert's death, Henry, <lb/>
            the prior of Canterbury, was promoted to the government of <lb/>
            Battle Abbey, an office which he worthily filled. On his <lb/>
            lecease, he was succeeded by Rodolph, prior of Rochester,2 <lb/>
            who was before a monk of Caen. He directed all his efforts by <lb/>
            i zeal for holiness and sound doctrine to secure his welfare <lb/>
            md that of his contemporaries, and persisted with ardour <lb/>
            in his spiritual exercises to a good old age. At length the <lb/>
            aged monk departed happily out of this world to God his <lb/>
            maker, in the 25th year of the reign of Henry, king of <lb/>
            England.</p>
          <p>After his coronation at London, King William ordered <lb/>
            many affairs with prudence, justice, and clemency. Some <lb/>
            of these concerned the profit and honour of that city, others <lb/>
            were for the advantage of the whole nation, and the rest <lb/>
            were intended for the benefit of the church. He enacted <lb/>
            some laws founded on admirable principles. No suitor ever <lb/>
            demanded justice of this king without obtaining it: he con­ <lb/>
            demned none but those whom it would have been unjust to <lb/>
            acquit. He enjoined his nobles to comport themselves with <lb/>
            grave dignity, joining activity to right. judgment, having <lb/>
            constantly before their eyes the Eternal King who had <lb/>
            given them the victory. He forbade their oppressing the <lb/>
            conquered, reminding them that they were their own <lb/>
            equals by their Christian profession, and that they must be <lb/>
            cautious not to excite revolt by their unjust treatment of <lb/>
            those whom they had fairly subdued. He prohibited all <lb/>
            riotous assemblages, murder, and robbery, and as he <lb/>
            restrained the people by force of arms, he set bounds to <lb/>
            arms by the laws. The taxes and all things concerning the <lb/>
            royal revenues were so regulated as not to be burdensome <lb/>
            to the people. Robbers, plunderers, and malefactors bad <lb/>
            no asylum in his dominions. Merchants found the ports <lb/>
            and highways open, and were protected against injury. <note type="footnote"> 1 Albert 1037—1063 or 1064; Bartholomew, 1063 or 1064—1084; <lb/>

          <p>The king, quitting London, spent some days at Barking,' <lb/>
            a place not far off, while some fortifications were completed <lb/>

            of Earl Algar, and the most powerful of the English nobles <lb/>

            asking his pardon, if in aught they had offended him, and <lb/>

            taking the oath of fealty, were honourably restored to their <lb/>

          <p>THE king, having thus provided for the security of the <lb/>
            kingdom, rode to Pevensey, where many English knights <lb/>
            assembled to meet him. Here the stipendiary soldiers who <lb/>

            Day King William then set sail in the month of March, <lb/>
            and crossed the sea in safety to his native dominions. He <lb/>
            took with him, in honourable attendance, Stigand the arch­ <lb/>
            bishop, Edgar Etheling, cousin of King Edward, and the <lb/>
            three powerful earls, Edwin, Morcar, and Waltheof, with <lb/>
            Ethelnoth, governor of Canterbury, and several others of <lb/>
            high rank and most graceful person. The king adopted a <lb/>
            courteous policy in thus preventing these great lords from <lb/>
            plotting a change during his absence, and the people would <lb/>
            be less able to rebel when deprived of their chiefs. Besides, <lb/>
            it gave him an opportunity of displaying his wealth and <lb/>
            honours in Normandy to the English nobles, while he de­ <lb/>
            tained as a sort of hostages those whose influence and <lb/>
            safety had great weight with their countrymen.</p>
          <p>The arrival of King William with all this worldly pomp <note type="footnote"> 1 Waltheof held the earldoms of Northampton and Huntingdon. </note> <pb n="6"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. CH. II. </note> <lb/>
            filled the whole of Normandy with rejoicings. The season <lb/>
            was still wintry, and it was Lent; but the bishops and <lb/>
            abbots began the festivals belonging to Easter, wherever the <lb/>
            new king came in his progress; nothing was omitted which <lb/>
            is customary in doing honour to such occasions, and every­ <lb/>
            thing new they could invent was added. This zeal was <lb/>
            recompensed, on the king's part, by magnificent offerings of <lb/>
            rich palls, large sums in gold, and other valuables to the <lb/>
            altars and servants of Christ. Those churches also which <lb/>
            he could not visit in person were made partakers of the <lb/>
            general joy by the gifts he sent to them.</p>
          <p>The feast of Faster was kept at the abbey of the Holy <lb/>
            Trinity at Fécamp, where a great number of bishops, abbots, <lb/>
            and nobles assembled. Earl Radulph, father-in-law of <lb/>
            Philip king of France2 with many of the French nobility, <lb/>
            were also there beholding with curiosity the long-haired <lb/>
            natives of English-Britain, and admiring the garments of <lb/>
            gold tissue, enriched with bullion, worn by the king and his <lb/>
            courtiers. They also were greatly struck with the beauty of <lb/>
            the gold and silver plate, and the horns tipped with gold at <lb/>
            both extremities. The French remarked many things of <lb/>
            this sort of a royal magnificence, the novelty of which made <lb/>
            them the subject of observation when they returned home.</p>
          <p>After Easter, the king caused the church of St. Mary on <lb/>
            the Dive to be consecrated,3 at which he himself reverently <lb/>
            assisted, with a great attendance both of the nobles and com­ <lb/>
            monalty, on the calends [1st] of May. He there pro­ <lb/>
            claimed by a herald, ordinances which were very beneficial <lb/>

            ordered the consecration of the church of St. Mary at <lb/>

            He made large endowments on both of these churches out <lb/>

            whom he had long served on the 5th of the ides [9th] of <lb/>
            August. His body was conveyed to the cathedral church, <lb/>

            to St. Mary, mother of God, and it was there interred with <lb/>
            high honours before the crucifix.1 His epitaph, composed <lb/>
            by Richard, son of Herluin, a canon of that church, and <lb/>
            inscribed in letters of gold on a plate of brass, runs thus:- <lb/>
            Men of Rouen! drop a tear <lb/>
            On your honour'd Maurille's bier: <lb/>
            Monk and bishop, such the claim <lb/>
            Of that venerable name. <lb/>
            Lordly Rheims beheld his birth, <lb/>
            Academic Liege his worth, <lb/>
            While he wisdom's treasures gain'd, <lb/>
            From her triple fountain drain'd. <lb/>
            Citizens! to him endeared, <lb/>
            'Twas for you this fane he rear'd; <lb/>
            Rais'd its pillar'd arches high, <lb/>
            Fill'd it with sweet minstrelsy, <lb/>
            And, amid your joyous throng, <lb/>
            Led the holy prayer and song. <lb/>
            Scarcely past the sacred mirth, <lb/>
            In the consecrated earth <lb/>
            Maurille's honour'd relics rest; <lb/>
            While his soul is with the blest, <lb/>
            And, released from mortal clay <lb/>
            On the eve of Laurent's day. <lb/>
            Borne to mansions in the sky, <lb/>
            Keeps the laurelled feast on high.</p>
          <p>After the death of Maurilius, the church of Rouen elected <lb/>
            Lanfranc, abbot of Caen, archbishop, a choice which King <lb/>
            William with his nobles and the whole people gladly con­ <lb/>
            firmed. But full of devotion to God and unfeigned humility, <lb/>
            Lanfranc refused to take upon himself the burden of this <note type="footnote"> 1 This expression always means the crucifix placed between the choir <lb/>

            near his tomb. This prelate was a native of Rheims, and had governed an <lb/>
            abbey at Florence. The consecration here spoken of by our author was <lb/>

            high dignity, and used all his influence for the promotion to <lb/>
            it of John, bishop of Avranches.1 That this might be <lb/>
            canonically accomplished, he went to Rome and obtained <lb/>
            from Pope Alexander a licence for bishop John's conse­ <lb/>
            cration, and brought back with the licence the pallium, <lb/>
            which conferred so much honour on himself and the whole <lb/>
            of Normandy.</p>
          <p>In consequence John was translated from the see of <lb/>
            Avranches, which he had filled seven years and three months, <lb/>
            to the metropolitan chair of Rouen. He was animated by a <lb/>
            lively zeal for virtue both in his words and actions, and like <lb/>
            Phineas, his hatred of vice was fervent. As for worldly <lb/>
            honour, his birth was most illustrious, being a son of Ralph, <lb/>
            count of Baieux, the uterine brother of Richard the elder, <lb/>
            duke of Normandy.2 He governed the metropolitan see <lb/>
            with firmness and activity ten years, taking severe measures <lb/>
            to separate incontinent priests from their concubines; and <lb/>
            when in a synod he prohibited their intercourse under pain <lb/>
            of excommunication, he was assailed with stones, and <lb/>
            forced to make his escape, on which occasion when flying <lb/>
            from the church he intoned with a loud voice the verse: <lb/>
            “ O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance." 3</p>
          <p>John was succeeded at Avranches by an Italian named <lb/>
            Michael, a prelate of great learning, and venerable for his <lb/>
            religious zeal, who was raised by canonical election to the <lb/>
            see of Avranches. He worthily filled the pastoral office <lb/>
            more than twenty years, and after a happy old age, died <lb/>
            in the time of Duke Robert. At his death Turgis was <note type="footnote"> 1 John, surnamed d'Avranches, became bishop of Avranches in Sept. <lb/>

            quarrels with the monks of St. Ouen, and for his great arrogance. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ralph, count d'lvri and de Bayeux, was uterine brother of Richard I., <lb/>

            married after the death of William Longsword. This union may appear <lb/>
            less disproportioned when it is recollected that she was only the duke's <lb/>
            concubine, he having a lawful wife, the duchess Leutgarde, who after his <lb/>

          <p>MEANWHILLE the English were oppressed by the insolence <lb/>
            of the Normans, and subjected to grievous outrages by the <lb/>
            haughty governors who disregarded the king's injunctions. <lb/>
            Thechiefs of inferior rank, who had the custody of the <lb/>
            castles, treated the natives, both gentle and simple, with <lb/>
            the utmost scorn, and levied on them most unjust exactions. <lb/>
            Bishop Odo himself, and William Fitz-Osbern, the king's <lb/>
            lieutenants, puffed up with pride, gave no heed to the <lb/>
            reasonable complaints of his English subjects and disdained <lb/>
            to weigh them in the balance of equity. They screened <lb/>
            their men-at-arms who most outrageously robbed the people <lb/>
            and ravished the women, and those only incurred their <lb/>
            wrath who were driven by these grievous affronts to be loud <lb/>
            in their remonstrances. The English deeply lamented the <lb/>
            loss of their freedom, and took secret counsel how they <lb/>
            might best shake off a yoke so insupportable, and to which <lb/>
            they were so little accustomed. They accordingly sent a <lb/>
            message to Sweyn,2 king of Denmark, entreating him to take <lb/>
            measures for recovering the crown of England, which his <lb/>
            ancestors Sweyn and Canute had formerly won by their vic­ <lb/>
            torious arms. Some went into voluntary exile, either to <lb/>
            free themselves from the domination of their Norman <lb/>
            masters, or for the purpose of obtaining foreign aid to <lb/>
            renew the contest with their conquerors. Some, the very <lb/>
            flower of the English youth, made their way to distant <lb/>
            regions, and served valiantly in the armies of Alexius, <lb/>
            emperor of Constantinople,3 a prince of great sagacity and <note type="footnote"> Michael was bishop of Avranches A.D. 1067—1094; Turgis, his <lb/>

            astonishing munificence. Being attacked by Robert Guis­ <lb/>
            card, duke of Apulia, with all his force in support of Michael, <lb/>
            whom the Greeks had expelled from the imperial throne for <lb/>
            the despotism of his government, the English exiles met a <lb/>
            favourable reception, and were arrayed in arms against the <lb/>
            Norman bands with which the Greeks were unable to cope. <lb/>
            The emperor Alexius laid the foundations of a town called <lb/>
            Chevetot,1 beyond Byzantium, for his English troops, but as <lb/>
            the Normans gave them great annoyance in that post, he <lb/>
            recalled them to the imperial city, and committed to their <lb/>
            guard his principal palace and the royal treasure. In this way <lb/>
            the Anglo-Saxons settled in Ionia, they and their posterity <lb/>
            becoming faithfully attached to the holy empire, and having <lb/>
            gained great honour in Thrace, continue to the present day, <lb/>
            beloved by the emperor, senate, and people.</p>
          <p>Provoked to rebellion by every sort of oppression on the <lb/>
            part of the Normans, the English sent messengers to Eustace, <lb/>
            count of Boulogne, inviting him to despatch a powerful fleet <lb/>
            to take Dover by surprise. They were formerly much at <lb/>
            variance with Eustace, but as differences had now risen <lb/>
            between him and the king, and they knew by fatal experi­ <lb/>
            ence that he was a skilful and fortunate commander, they <note type="footnote"> Norwegians, and English in the service of the Greek emperors, who formed <lb/>
            their body-guard. They were armed with battle-axes, were exceedingly <lb/>
            brave and faithful, and possessed great privileges. They are called by the <lb/>
            Greek historians Varanges or Baranges, a word of northern derivation, <lb/>
            signifying warrior (waring), and found in Normandy as a family name, <lb/>
            and in names of places, as Warrene, Varingeville. This body of Varangi <lb/>
            were employed at Constantinople so long back as the reign of the emperor <lb/>
            Michael the Paphlagonian, 1034—1041, and consequently at a time far <lb/>
            preceding that in which our author places the English exiles among them, <lb/>
            or the battle of Hastings. No doubt, the original band were Danes or <lb/>
            Norwegians, and the English were incorporated with them, as they suc­ <lb/>
            cessively withdrew from the Norman yoke. Besides, the great body of the <lb/>
            English who adhered to Harold were of Dane-Norwegian extraction, as <lb/>
            indeed two thirds of the inhabitants of the north of England then were, <lb/>
            and it was quite natural for them to join their countrymen at Constantinople <lb/>
            with the allurements of high pay and distinction. In the end, their num­ <lb/>
            bers became so great, that several Greek writers speak of the Varangi as <lb/>
            exclusively English. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The Chevetot of our author is called by Villehardoun, Chivetoi, and he <lb/>

            were reconciled to him, and used their utmost efforts to <lb/>
            wrest Dover castle from the royal garrison and deliver it to <lb/>
            Eustace. He no sooner received the message of the Ken­ <lb/>
            tish-men, than, his fleet being in readiness, he embarked his <lb/>
            troops and made a quick passage in the dead of the night, <lb/>
            hoping to find the garrison off their guard. He had with <lb/>
            him many knights, but all their horses were left behind, <lb/>
            except a very few. The whole neighbourhood was in arms, <lb/>
            and especially a strong body of Kentish-men who seconded <lb/>
            Eustace's attack with all their might. The bishop of Bayeux <lb/>
            and Hugh de Mountfort, who were principally charged with <lb/>
            the defence of the coast, were on the other side of the <lb/>
            Thames, and had drawn off with them the main part of the <lb/>
            troops. If the siege had been prolonged for two days, a <lb/>
            large body of the enemy would have assembled from a dis­ <lb/>
            tance. But while the assailants made desperate attacks up­ <lb/>
            on the place, the garrison were prepared for an obstinate <lb/>
            defence, and offered a determined resistance at the points <lb/>
            most open to attack. The conflict was maintained with fury <lb/>
            on both sides for some hours of the day. But Eustace <lb/>
            beginning to be doubtful of success, and being apprehensive <lb/>
            of a sally by the besieged, which might force him to a more <lb/>
            shameful retreat, gave the signal for retiring to the ships. <lb/>
            Upon this the garrison immediately opened the gates, and <lb/>
            falling on the rear-guard with spirit, but in good order, <lb/>
            killed a great many of them. The fugitives, panic-struck by <lb/>
            a report that the bishop of Bayeux had unexpectedly arrived <lb/>
            with a strong force, threw themselves in their alarm among <lb/>
            the crevices of the perpendicular cliffs, and so perished with <lb/>
            more disgrace than if they had fallen by the sword. Many <lb/>
            were the forms of death to which their defeat exposed them, <lb/>
            many, throwing away their arms, were killed by falling on <lb/>
            the sharp rocks ; others, slipping down, destroyed themselves <lb/>
            and their comrades by their own weapons ; and many, mor­ <lb/>
            tally wounded, or bruised by their fall, rolled yet breathing <lb/>
            into the sea; many more, escaping breathless with haste to <lb/>
            the ships, were so eager to reach a place of safety that they <lb/>
            crowded the vessels till they upset them and were drowned <lb/>
            on the spot. The Norman cavalry took prisoners or slew as <lb/>
            many as they could overtake. Eustace escaped by having the <lb/>
            advantage of a fleet horse, his knowledge of the road, and <pb n="12"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IV. CII.III. </note> <lb/>
            finding a ship ready to put to sea. His nephew, a noble <lb/>
            youth who bore arms for the first time, was taken prisoner. <lb/>
            The English escaped through by-roads, the garrison of the <lb/>
            castle being too few in number to pursue a multitude who <lb/>
            thus dispersed themselves.</p>
          <p>Not long afterwards Count Eustace effected a reconcilia­ <lb/>
            tion with King William, and enjoyed his friendship for many <lb/>
            years afterwards. This count's origin was most illustrious, <lb/>
            as he was a descendant of Charlemagne, the mightiest king <lb/>
            of the Franks. His power also was very great, he being <lb/>
            sovereign prince of the three counties of Boulogne, Guines, <lb/>
            and Terouanne.1 He married Ida,2 a noble and religious <lb/>
            woman, who was sister of Godfrey, duke of Lorraine. She <lb/>
            bore him three sons, Godfrey, Baldwin, and Eustace, and a <lb/>
            daughter who married Henry IV., emperor of Germany.</p>
          <p>While most of the English, sighing for their ancient liber­ <lb/>
            ties, were plotting rebellion for the purpose of recovering <lb/>
            them, there were numbers of that nation who kept the faith <lb/>
            they had pledged to God, and were obedient to the king whom <lb/>
            he had set up, according to the apostle's precept: " Fear God, <lb/>
            honour the king."8 Earl Copsi, one of the most distin­ <lb/>
            guished of the English nobles both by birth and power, and <lb/>
            still more by his singular prudence and entire honesty of pur­ <lb/>
            pose, faithfully adhered to King William, and espoused his <lb/>
            cause with much zeal. His own vassals were, however, very <lb/>
            far from following his example, being determined supporters <lb/>
            and friends of the malcontents. They therefore assailed <lb/>
            him in every way, using prayers, threats, and protestations, <lb/>
            to induce him to desert the party of the foreigners and <lb/>
            second the wishes of good men of his own race and nation. <lb/>

            rendered themselves serviceable to the king, in obedience to <lb/>
            justice, remembering the admonition of the wise man: <lb/>
            “My son, fear God and the king.”2 At the same time <lb/>
            some of the most discreet citizens of the towns, and noble <lb/>
            knights of distinguished names and wealth, with many of the <lb/>
            commonalty, espoused the cause of the Normans against <lb/>
            their own countrymen with great zeal.</p>

            Normandy to provide carefully for its tranquillity during a <lb/>
            long period. With the advice of wise counsellors, he <lb/>
            enacted just laws, and rendered equal justice to the poor as <lb/>
            well as the rich. He selected the best men for judges and <lb/>
            governors in all the provinces of Normandy. He freed the <lb/>
            holy monasteries and the domains granted to them from all <lb/>
            unjust exactions, by royal privileges and charters of <lb/>
            protection. He proclaimed by the voice of heralds security <lb/>
            to all, both natives and foreigners, throughout his dominions, <lb/>
            and at the same time the severest penalties against thieves, <lb/>
            rioters, and those who broke the peace of the country.</p>

          <p>WHILE the king was thus occupied, reports reached him <lb/>
            from beyond sea, and, mingling evil with his best hopes, <lb/>
            caused him great disquietude; for, the disaffection of the <lb/>

            religious prelates and valiant nobles to be guardians of the <lb/>
            state. He then rode on the night of the Gth of December <lb/>
            to the mouth of the river of Dieppe, below the town of <lb/>
            Arques,2 and, setting sail with a south wind in the first <lb/>
            watch of the cold night, reached in the morning, after a most <lb/>
            prosperous voyage, the harbour on the opposite coast called <lb/>
            Winchelsea. Hitherto the wintry winds had made the sea <lb/>
            very tempestuous, but the church was then celebrating the <lb/>
            feast of St. Nicholas, bishop of Myra, and prayers were <lb/>
            offered in Normandy on behalf of their pious prince. The <lb/>
            providence of God, therefore, which conducts all those it <lb/>
            favours when and where it wills, brought the good king to a <lb/>
            port of safety, amid the storms of winter. In his present! <lb/>
            voyage he was attended by Roger do Montgomery,3 who, at <lb/>
            the time of his former expedition to invade England, was <lb/>
            left, with his wife, governor of Normandy. The king first <lb/>
            conferred on him the earldoms of Chichester and Arundel, <lb/>
            and, after a time, made him earl of Shrewsbury.</p>
          <p>On the king's landing he was well received by the English, <lb/>
            and entertained with fitting honours, both by the monks and <lb/>
            secular officers. He kept the feast of Christmas at London, I <lb/>
            treating the English bishops and nobles with great courtesy. <lb/>
            He received each with open arms, gave them the kiss of <lb/>
            welcome, and was affable to all. When they made any <lb/>
            request it was graciously granted, and he listened favourably <lb/>
            to what they reported or advised. By these arts the numbers <lb/>
            of the treasonably disposed were reduced. While be some­ <lb/>

            continually on their guard, in all quarters, against the crafty <lb/>
            designs of their enemies. All the cities and provinces <lb/>
            which he had himself visited or had occupied with garrisons, <lb/>
            obeyed his will; but, on the frontiers of the kingdom, in the <lb/>
            northern and western districts, the same wild independence <lb/>
            prevailed which formerly made the people insubordinate <lb/>
            except when they pleased, to the kings of England in the <lb/>
            times of Edward and his predecessors.</p>
          <p>Exeter was the first to contend for freedom, but being <lb/>
            attacked with vigour by powerful troops it was compelled to <lb/>
            submit. It is a rich and ancient city, built in a plain, and <lb/>
            fortified with much care, being distant about two miles from <lb/>
            the sea coast, where it is reached by the shortest passage from <lb/>
            Ireland or Brittany. The townsmen held it in great force, <lb/>
            raging furiously, both young and old, against all Frenchmen. <lb/>
            In their zeal they had invited allies from the neighbouring <lb/>
            districts, had detained foreign merchants who. were fit for <lb/>
            war, and built or repaired walls and towers, and added <lb/>
            whatever was reckoned wanting to their defences. They <lb/>
            had also engaged other towns, by envoys they sent, to join in <lb/>
            league with them, and prepared to oppose with all their <lb/>
            strength the foreign king, with whom before they had no <lb/>
            connection. When the king heard of these proceedings, he <lb/>
            commanded the chief citizens to take the oath of fealty to <lb/>
            him. But they returned this reply: " We will neither <lb/>
            swear allegiance to the king, nor admit him within our walls; <lb/>
            but will pay him tribute, according to ancient custom." To <lb/>
            this, the king gave this answer: “ It does not suit me to <lb/>
            have subjects on such conditions." He then marched an <lb/>
            army into their territories, and in that expedition called out <lb/>
            the English for the first time. The elders of the city, when <lb/>
            they learned that the king's army was approaching near, <lb/>
            went out to meet him, entreating for peace, promising to <lb/>
            obey all his commands, and offering him such hostages as he <lb/>
            required. When, however, they returned to their fellow <lb/>
            citizens, who were in great alarm at the guilt they had <lb/>
            incurred, they found them still determined - to persist in <lb/>
            their hostilities, and for various reasons roused themselves to <lb/>
            stand on their defence. The king, who had halted four <pb n="16"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. CH.IV </note> <lb/>
            miles from the city, was filled with anger and surprise or <lb/>
            receiving this intelligence.</p>
          <p>In the first place, therefore, he advanced with five hundred <lb/>
            horse to reconnoitre the place and the fortifications, and t( <lb/>
            ascertain what the enemy was doing. He found the gate: <lb/>
            shut, and crowds of people posted on the outworks, an( <lb/>
            round the whole circuit of the walls. In consequence, bi <lb/>
            the king's order, the whole army moved to the city, and one <lb/>
            of the hostages had his eyes put out before the gate. But <lb/>
            the mad obstinacy of the people neither yielded to fear noi <lb/>
            to commiseration for the fate of the other hostages; but <lb/>
            strengthened itself in the determination to defend themselves <lb/>
            and their homes to the last. The king therefore strongly <lb/>
            invested the city on all sides, assaulted it with the utmost <lb/>
            force of his arms, and for many days continued his attacks <lb/>
            on the townsmen stationed on the walls, and his efforts tc <lb/>
            undermine them from beneath.' At length the chie: <lb/>
            citizens were compelled, by the resolute assaults of the <lb/>
            enemy, to have recourse to wiser counsels, and humbling; <lb/>
            themselves, to implore mercy, a procession of the most lovely <lb/>
            of the young women, the elders of the city, and the clergy <lb/>
            carrying the sacred books and holy ornaments, went out tc <lb/>
            the king. Having humbly prostrated themselves at his feet <lb/>
            the king, with great moderation, extended his clemency tc <lb/>
            the repentant people, and pardoned their offences as if he <lb/>
            had forgotten their obstinate resistance to his authority <lb/>
            and that they had before treated with insult and cruelty <lb/>
            some knights he had sent from Normandy, and who were <lb/>
            driven by a storm into their port. The citizens of Exeter <lb/>
            were full of joy, and gave thanks to God at finding that, after <lb/>
            so much anger and such terrible threats, they had made <lb/>
            their peace with the foreign king better than they expected. <lb/>
            William refrained from confiscating their goods, and posted <lb/>
            strong and trusty bands of soldiers at the city gates, that the <lb/>
            army might not force an entrance, in a body, and pillage <lb/>
            the citizens. He then selected a spot within the walls for <lb/>
            erecting a castle, and left there Baldwin de Meules, son of <lb/>
            Count Gislebert, and other knights of eminence to complete <lb/>
            the works and garrison the place. Continuing his march <lb/>
            afterwards into Cornwall, the furthest extremity of Britain, <note type="footnote"> 1 The siege lasted eighteen days. </note><note type="footnote">a " Cornu-Britanniæ. </note> <pb n="17"/>

            and having everywhere restored order by his sudden move­ <lb/>
            ments, he disbanded his army, and returned to Guent' in <lb/>
            time for the vacation at the feast of Easter.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord, 1068,2 King William sent persons <lb/>
            of high rank toNormandy to bring over his queen Matilda, <lb/>
            who quickly obeyed her husband's commands with a willing <lb/>
            mind, and crossed the sea with a great attendance of <lb/>
            knights and noble women. Among the clergy who were <lb/>
            attached to her court for the performance of sacred offices, <lb/>
            the most distinguished was Guy, bishop of Amiens, who <lb/>
            had composed a poem on the battle between Harold and <lb/>
            William.3 Aldred, arch bishop of York, who had crowned <lb/>
            and anointed her husband, consecrated Matilda to partake <lb/>
            in the honours of royalty, at the feast of Whitsuntide, in <lb/>
            the second year of William's reign. Being now a crowned <lb/>
            queen, Matilda, before a year was ended, gave birth to a <lb/>
            son named Henry,4 who was declared heir to all the king's <lb/>
            dominions in England. This young prince had his attention <lb/>
            turned to a learned education as soon as he was of age to <lb/>
            receive instruction, and after the death of both his parents, <lb/>
            had a bold career in arms. At last, having distinguished <lb/>
            himself by his various claims to merit, he filled his father's <lb/>
            throne for many years.</p>
          <p>The same year, Edwin and Morcar, sons of Earl Algar, <lb/>
            and young men of great promise, broke into open rebellion, <lb/>
            and induced many others to fly to arms, which violently <lb/>
            disturbed the realm of Albion. King William, however, <lb/>
            came to terms with Edwin, who assured him of the <lb/>
            submission of his brother and of nearly a third of the <lb/>
            kingdom, upon which the king promised to give him his <lb/>
            daughter in marriage. Afterwards, however, by a fraudu­ <lb/>
            lent decision of the Normans, and through their envy and <lb/>
            covetousness, the king refused to give him the princess who <lb/>
            was the object of his desire, and for whom he had long <lb/>
            waited. Being, therefore, much incensed, he and his <lb/>
            brother again broke into rebellion, and the greatest part of <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Guentam," Winchester. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We have found onr author sometimes reckon the commencement of <lb/>

            the English and Welsh followed their standard. The two <lb/>
            brothers were zealous in the worship of God, and respected <lb/>
            good men. They were remarkably handsome, their relations <lb/>
            were of high birth and very numerous, their estates were <lb/>
            vast and gave them immense power, and their popularity <lb/>
            great. The clergy and monks offered continual prayers on <lb/>
            their behalf, and crowds of poor daily supplications.</p>
          <p>Earl Algar had founded a monastery at Coventry,1 and <lb/>
            amply endowed it with large revenues for the subsistence of <lb/>
            the monks belonging to it. The countess Godiva also, a <lb/>
            devout lady, had contributed all her wealth to the monastery, <lb/>
            and employed goldsmiths to convert all the gold and silver <lb/>
            she possessed into sacred tapestries, and crosses, and images <lb/>
            of saints, and other ecclesiastical ornaments of wonderful <lb/>
            beauty, which she devoutly distributed. These excellent <lb/>
            parents, thus devoted to God and praiseworthy for their <lb/>
            piety, had a fine family which merited the greatest distinc­ <lb/>
            tion, viz., Edwin, Morcar, and a daughter named Edith, who <lb/>
            was first married to Griffith, king of Wales, and after his <lb/>
            death to Harold, king of England.2</p>

            king of Wales,3 came to the aid of his uncles, at the head of a <lb/>
            large body of Britons. A general assembly was now held <lb/>
            of the chief men of the English and Welsh, at which uni­ <lb/>
            versal complaints were made of the outrages and tyranny to <lb/>
            which the English were subjected by the Normans and their <lb/>
            adherents, and messengers were despatched into all parts of <lb/>
            Albion to rouse the natives against their enemies, either <lb/>
            secretly or openly. All joined In a determined league and <lb/>
            bold conspiracy against the Normans for the recovery of <lb/>
            their ancient liberties. The rebellion broke out with great <lb/>

            gents fortified themselves in the woods and marshes, on the <lb/>
            estuaries, and in some cities. York was in a state of the <lb/>
            highest excitement, which the holiness of its bishop was <lb/>
            unable to calm. Numbers lived in tents, disdaining to dwell <lb/>
            in houses lest they should become enervated; from which <lb/>
            some of them were called savages by the Normans.</p>
          <p>In consequence of these commotions, the lung carefully sur­ <lb/>
            veyed the most inaccessible points in the country, and, select­ <lb/>
            ing suitable spots, fortified them against the enemy s excur­ <lb/>
            sions. In the English districts there were very few fortresses, <lb/>
            which the Normans call castles; so that, though the English <lb/>
            were warlike and brave, they were little able to make a deter­ <lb/>
            mined resistance. One castle the king built at Warwick,and <lb/>
            gave it into the custody of Henry, son of Roger de Beau­ <lb/>
            mont.1 Edwin and Morcar, now considering the doubtful issue <lb/>
            of the contest, and not unwisely preferring peace to war, sought <lb/>
            the king's favour, which they obtained, at least, in appear­ <lb/>
            ance. The king then built a castle at Nottingham, which he <lb/>
            committed to the custody of William Peverell.</p>
          <p>When the inhabitants of York heard the state of affairs, <lb/>
            they became so alarmed that they made hasty submission, in <lb/>
            order to avoid being compelled by force ; delivering the keys <lb/>
            of the city to the king, and offering him hostages. But, <lb/>
            suspecting their faith, he strengthened the fortress within <lb/>
            the city walls, and placed in it a garrison of picked men. At <lb/>
            this time, Archill, the most powerful chief of the Northum­ <lb/>
            brians made a treaty of peace with the king, and gave him <lb/>
            his son asa hostage.The bishop of Durham,2 also, being <lb/>
            reconciled to King William, became the mediator for peace <lb/>
            with the king of the Scots, and was the bearer into Scotland <lb/>
            of the terms offered by William. Though the aid of Mal­ <lb/>
            colm had been solicited by the English, and he had prepared <lb/>
            tocome to their succour with a strong force, yet when he <lb/>
            heard what the envoy had to propose with respect to a peace, <lb/>
            he remained quiet, and joyfully sent back ambassadors in <lb/>
            company with the bishop of Durham, who in his name swore <lb/>
            fealty to King William. In thus preferring peace to war, he <lb/>
            best consulted his own welfare, and the inclinations of his <lb/>
            subjects; for the people of Scotland, though fierce, in war, <note type="footnote"> 1 He was created earl of Warwick. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Egelwin, bishop of Durham. </note> <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <pb n="20"/>

            selves about their neighbours' affairs, loving rather religious <lb/>
            exercises than those of arms. On his return from this <lb/>
            expedition, the king erected castles at Lincoln, Huntingdon, <lb/>
            and Cambridge, placing in each of them garrisons composed <lb/>
            of his bravest soldiers.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, some of the Norman women were so inflamed <lb/>
            by passion that they sent frequent messages to their hus­ <lb/>
            bands, requiring their speedy return, adding that, if it were <lb/>
            not immediate, they should choose others. They would not <lb/>
            venture as yet to join their lords, on account of the sea <lb/>
            voyage, which was entirely new to them. Nor did they like <lb/>
            to pass into England where their husbands were always in <lb/>
            arms, and fresh expeditions were daily undertaken, attended <lb/>
            with much effusion of blood on both sides. But the king <lb/>
            naturally wished to retain his soldiers while the country was <lb/>
            in so disturbed a state, and made them great offers of lands <lb/>
            with ample revenues and great powers, promising still more <lb/>
            when the whole kingdom should be freed from their opponents. <lb/>
            The lawfully created barons and leading soldiers were in <lb/>
            great perplexity, for they were sensible that, if they took their <lb/>
            departure while their sovereign, with their brothers, friends <lb/>
            and comrades, were surrounded by the perils of war, they <lb/>
            would be publicly branded as base traitors and cowardly <lb/>
            deserters. On the other hand, what were these honourable <lb/>
            soldiers to do, when their licentious wives threatened to stain <lb/>
            the marriage bed with adultery, and stamp the mark of <lb/>
            infamy on their offspring ?1 In consequence, Hugh de <lb/>

          <p>England was now a scene of general desolation, a prey to <lb/>
            the ravages both of natives and foreigners. Fire, robbery, <lb/>
            and daily slaughter, did their worst on the wretched people, <lb/>
            who were for ever attacked, trampled down, and crushed. <lb/>
            Calamity involved both the victors and their victims in the <lb/>

            lence, and famine, according to the dispensations of the <lb/>
            Almighty Disposer of events. The king, therefore, taking <lb/>
            into consideration the impoverished state of the country, <lb/>
            assembled the stipendiary soldiers he had in his pay, and, <lb/>

          <p>IN the third year of his reign, King William gave the <lb/>
            county of Durham to Robert de Comines, who soon after­ <lb/>
            wards entered the city, with great confidence, at the head of <lb/>
            five hundred men. But the citizens assembled early in the <lb/>
            night, and massacred Robert and all his troops, except two, <lb/>
            who escaped by flight.2 The bravest of men were unable to <lb/>
            defend themselves, taken at disadvantage, at such an hour, <lb/>
            and overwhelmed by numbers.</p>
          <p>Not long afterwards, Robert Fitz-Richard, the governor of <lb/>
            York, was slain with many of his retainers. Confidence <note type="footnote"> 1 William's resentment against Hugh de Grantmesnil does not appear <lb/>
            to have been so lasting as our author represents it, for Hugh not only <lb/>

            he possessed a vast number of manors, and where he filled important <lb/>
            offices, but his wife, Adeliza, held directly of the crown- several manors in <lb/>

            Normans, by whom their friends and allies were grievously <lb/>
            oppressed. Oaths, fealty, and the safety of their hostages <lb/>
            were of little weight to men who became infuriated by th( <lb/>
            loss of their patrimony and the murder of their kinsfolk anc <lb/>
            countrymen.</p>
          <p>Marlesweyn, Cospatric, Edgar Atheling, Arcbill, and the <lb/>
            four sons of Karol, with other powerful and factious nobles <lb/>
            collected their forces, and joining a band of the townsmer <lb/>
            and their neighbours, made a desperate attack on the royal <lb/>
            fortress of York. William Malet, the governor of the castle <lb/>
            was, therefore, compelled to inform the king that he must <lb/>
            surrender, unless his harassed troops received immediate <lb/>
            reinforcements. The king flew to the spot, and fell on the <lb/>
            besiegers, none of whom he spared. Many of them were <lb/>
            taken prisoners, numbers slain, the rest put to flight. The <lb/>
            king spent eight days in the city, making an additional for­ <lb/>
            tification, and committed the place to the custody of the <lb/>
            earl William Fitz-Osbern. He then returned in triumph <lb/>
            to Winchester, where he celebrated the feast of Easter. <lb/>
            After the king's departure, the English re-assembled and <lb/>
            renewed their attack, menacing both the fortresses; but <lb/>
            Earl William and his troops, falling on the insurgents in a <lb/>
            certain valley, defeated them, many being slain or taken <lb/>
            prisoners, and the rest, for the present, escaped by flight.</p>
          <p>Being thus unceasingly occupied by revolts which broke <lb/>
            out in every quarter, King William sent back Matilda, his <lb/>
            dearly beloved wife, to Normandy, where, sheltered from the <lb/>
            tumults with which England was distracted, she might have <lb/>
            leisure to devote herself to religious duties, and watch over <lb/>
            the safety of the province and of Robert her son. This <lb/>
            princess was cousin to Philip, king of France, and being <lb/>
            descended from the royal line of the French kings and the <lb/>
            emperors of Germany,1 she was no less distinguished by her <lb/>
            illustrious birth, than by the effulgence of her virtues. Her <lb/>
            august husband had by her an enviable family, consisting <lb/>
            both of sons and daughters: Robert and Richard, William <lb/>
            Rufus and Henry, Agatha and Constance, Adeliza, Adela, <lb/>

            life, and have afforded ample materials from which eloquent <lb/>
            writers have composed voluminous works.1 Beauty of person, <lb/>
            high birth, a cultivated mind, and exalted virtue, combined <lb/>
            to grace this illustrious queen, and, what is still more worthy <lb/>
            of immortal praise, she was firm in the faith, and devoted to <lb/>
            the service of Christ. Her charities, which she daily <lb/>
            distributed with fervent zeal, contributed more than I am <lb/>
            able to express to the prosperity of her husband, continually <lb/>
            struggling in his warlike career.</p>
          <p>The two sons of Harold,2 king of England, took refuge <lb/>
            with Dermot, king of Ireland, disconsolate at their father's <lb/>
            death and their own expulsion. Obtaining succour from <lb/>
            him and his chief nobles, they appeared off Exeter, with <lb/>
            sixty-six vessels, full of troops. Landing on the coast they <lb/>
            began boldly to ravage the interior of the country, subjecting <lb/>
            it to severe losses by fire and sword. But they were quickly <lb/>
            encountered by Brian, son of Eudes, count of Brittany, <lb/>
            and William Gualdi, at the head of an armed force, which, <lb/>
            after two battles on the same day, reduced their fearful <lb/>
            numbers so much that those who were left escaped in two <lb/>
            vessels, and on their return filled Ireland with grief. Indeed, <lb/>
            if night had not put an end to the conflict, not even one <lb/>
            would have returned home with tidings of the disaster. So <lb/>
            just a fate befell the tyrant's sons, attempting to revenge <lb/>
            him and those who aided them in such an enterprize.3</p>
          <p>During these occurrences Githa, the wife of Godwin and <lb/>
            mother of Harold, secretly collected vast wealth, and from <note type="footnote"> 1 The histories of the sons of William and Matilda are well known; of <lb/>
            the daughters, Agatha, the eldest, was betrothed successively to Harold <lb/>
            and to Alphonso, king of Gallicia, but died while she was on her way to <lb/>
            Spain, as will appear hereafter. Constance married Alan Fergan, duke of <lb/>
            Brittany, and Adela, Stephen, count de Blois. Adeliza became a nun in <lb/>
            the convent of St. Leger-de-Préaux, and Cecilia in that of the Holy <lb/>
            Trinity at Cadiz, of which she was afterwards abbess. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There were three, not two, sons of Harold, who claimed the protection <lb/>

            taken in 1068, was neither so short nor disastrous as our author represents. <lb/>
            It was not Brian of Brittany, but Eadnoth, formerly Harold's master-of­ <lb/>
            the-horse, who put himself at the head of the forces which resisted the sons <lb/>
            of his late master. He was killed in the battle, but the fleet though repulsed <lb/>

            return.1</p>
          <p>At that time Sweyn, king of Denmark, equipped with <lb/>
            great care a powerful fleet, in which he embarked both <lb/>
            Danes and English under the command of his two sons2 <lb/>
            and his brother Osbern, with two pontiffs and three <lb/>
            distinguished earls, directing the armament against England. <lb/>
            For he had often been invited by the earnest prayers of the <lb/>
            English, accompanied by large sums of money, and he was <lb/>
            also moved by the loss of his countrymen recently slain in <lb/>
            the battle with Harold; and being the nephew of King <lb/>
            Edward, who was son of Hardicanute, his ambition was <lb/>
            excited by his near relationship to the throne. This king <lb/>
            was possessed of great power, and he assembled the whole <lb/>
            strength of his kingdom, which was augmented by aux­ <lb/>
            iliary forces from neighbouring countries with which he <lb/>
            was allied. He was thus supported by Poland, Frisia, and <lb/>
            Saxony. Leutecia3 also furnished a body of stipendiary <lb/>
            soldiers hired with English wealth. That populous country <lb/>
            was inhabited by a nation which, still lost in the errors of <lb/>
            paganism, was ignorant of the true God, but, entangled in <lb/>
            the toils of ignorance, worshipped Woden, Thor, and Frea, <lb/>
            and other false gods, or rather demons. This nation was ex­ <lb/>
            perienced in war both by sea and land, but Sweyn had often <lb/>
            gained victories over it under its king, and had reduced it <lb/>
            to submission. Grown arrogant by repeated successes, and <lb/>
            seeking to raise his power and glory to a still higher pitch, <lb/>
            Sweyn, as we have already mentioned, fitted out an expedi­ <lb/>
            tion against King William. The Danes attempted a landing <lb/>
            at Dover, but were repulsed by the royal troops. Making <note type="footnote"> 1 This princess, who is also called Edith, escaping from Exeter in 1067, <lb/>

            ders, and took refuge at St. Omer. Her name frequently appears in the <lb/>
            Domesday-book, where it is spelt Ghida, Gida, or Gueda. The entries <lb/>

            another attempt at Sandwich, they were again repulsed by <lb/>
            the Normans. However they found an opportunity of <lb/>
            disembarking at Ipswich, and dispersed themselves to pillage <lb/>
            the neighbourhood; but the country people assembled, and <lb/>
            slaying thirty of them, compelled the rest to save themselves <lb/>
            by flight. Having landed at Norwich for a similar incur­ <lb/>
            sion, they were encountered by Ralph de Guader, who put <lb/>
            numbers of them to the sword, caused many to be drowned, <lb/>
            and forced the rest to retire with disgrace to their ships <lb/>
            and put to sea. King William was at this time in the <lb/>
            forest of Dean following the chace, as it was his custom to <lb/>
            do. Receiving intelligence there of these descents of the <lb/>
            Danes, he instantly despatched a messenger to York, with di­ <lb/>
            rections to his officers to be on their guard against the enemy, <lb/>
            and to summon him to their support if necessity required. <lb/>
            Those to whom the custody of the fortresses was entrusted <lb/>
            sent word in reply that they should- need no succour from <lb/>
            him for a year to come. By this time the Atheling,1 <lb/>
            Waltheof, Siward, and other powerful English lords, had <lb/>
            joined the Danes, who landed at the mouth of the <lb/>
            broad river Humber. The Atbeling had gone there on a <lb/>
            predatory excursion with his own followers, and was sepa­ <lb/>
            rated from the allied troops. But they were unexpectedly <lb/>
            attacked by the king's garrisons, sallying forth from <lb/>
            Lincoln, who took them all prisoners, except two who <lb/>
            escaped with the Atheling, and destroyed their ship which <lb/>
            those who were left to guard it abandoned in alarm.</p>
          <p>The Danes now invested York, their force being much <lb/>
            increased by the number of the natives who assembled to <lb/>
            support them. Waltheof, Cospatric, Marisweyn, Elnoc, <lb/>
            Archill, and the four sons of Karol, marched in the van, <lb/>
            taking their stations in front of the Danes and Norwegians. <lb/>
            The garrison of the castle made a rash sally, and, engaging <lb/>
            within the city walls, fought at a disadvantage. Being <lb/>
            unable to resist the numbers of the assailants, they were all <lb/>
            killed or made prisoners. The castles having lost their <lb/>
            defenders were open to the enemy. The king was still en­ <lb/>
            joying a false security when the news of this disaster reached <lb/>
            him. Report magnified the force of the invaders, and said <lb/>
            that they were prepared to join battle with the king himself. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Adelinus," Edgar Atheling. </note> <pb n="26"/>

            William, roused by grief and anger, hastened his preparations! <lb/>
            for advancing against them; but they, fearing to measure <lb/>
            themselves with so renowned a commander, fled to thE <lb/>
            Humber, and sailed over to the shore which borders or <lb/>
            Lindsey. The king pursued them with his cavalry, and <lb/>
            finding some marauders in the almost inaccessible fens, put <lb/>
            them to the sword and destroyed some of their fastnesses. <lb/>
            The Danes escaped to the opposite shore, waiting an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of revenging themselves and their comrades.</p>
          <p>At that time the West Saxons of Dorset and Somerset, <lb/>
            and their neighbours, made an attack on Moutacute, but by <lb/>
            God's providence they were foiled in their attempt; for <lb/>
            the men of Winchester, London, and Salisbury, under the <lb/>
            command of Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances, came upon them <lb/>
            by surprise, slew some of them, and mutilating a number <lb/>
            of the prisoners, put the rest to flight. Meanwhile the <lb/>
            Welsh, with the men of Cheshire, laid siege to the king's <lb/>
            castle at Shrewsbury, aided by the townsmen under Edric <lb/>
            Guilda,l a powerful and warlike man, and other fierce <lb/>
            English. The same thing was done at Exeter by the people <lb/>
            of Devonshire, and a host of men assembled from Cornwall. <lb/>
            It is the extreme point of the west of England towards <lb/>
            Ireland, from whence it derives its name of Oornu Bri­ <lb/>
            tanniœ, the horn of Britain, or Cornwall. The citizens of <lb/>
            Exeter took the king's side, for they had not forgotten the <lb/>
            sufferings they had formerly endured. The king receiving <lb/>
            this intelligence lost no time in giving orders to two earls, <lb/>
            William and Brian,2 to march to the relief of the two <lb/>
            places which were attacked. But before they reached <lb/>
            Shrewsbury, the enemy had burnt the town and retired. <lb/>
            The garrison of Exeter made a sudden sally, and charging <lb/>
            the besiegerr with impetuosity, put them to the rout. <lb/>
            William and Brian, meeting the fugitives, punished their <lb/>

            nany conflicts blood flowed freely on both sides, and the <lb/>
            lefenceless population, as well as those who were in arms, <lb/>
            suffered from time to time severe disasters. The divine law <lb/>
            was everywhere violated, and ecclesiastical discipline became <lb/>
            almost universally relaxed. Murders were wretchedly fre­ <lb/>
            quent men's hearts were stimulated to evil by the incentives <lb/>
            of covetousness and passion, and they were hurried in <lb/>
            crowds to hell, condemned by God whose judgments always <lb/>
            prove just. Upon King William's return from Lindsey he <lb/>
            left there his half brother Robert Count de Mortaine, <lb/>
            md Robert Count d'Eu, to restrain the incursions of <lb/>
            the Danes. The invaders lurked for a while in concealment, <lb/>
            but when they supposed it was safe, they issued from their <lb/>
            lens to join in the festivals of the country people on what <lb/>
            are called their farms. Upon this the two earls fell upon <lb/>
            them unexpectedly, and mingling their blood with the feasts, <lb/>
            followed them up'while they were in disorder, and pursued <lb/>
            them to their very ships, slaughtering them as they fled. <lb/>
            It was again reported that the brigands had gone to York, <lb/>
            to celebrate the feast of the nativity, and prepare themselves <lb/>
            for battle. The king was hastening thither from Notting­ <lb/>
            ham, but was stopped at Pontefract, where the river was <lb/>
            not fordable, and could not be crossed by boats. lie would <lb/>
            not listen to those who advised him to return ; and to those <lb/>
            who proposed to construct a bridge he replied that it was <lb/>
            not expedient, as the enemy might come upon them un­ <lb/>
            awares, and take the opportunity of their being so engaged <lb/>
            to inflict a loss upon them. They were detained there <lb/>
            three weeks. At length, a brave knight named Lisois des <lb/>
            Moutiers, carefully sounded the river, searching for a ford <lb/>
            both above and below the town. At last, with great diffi­ <lb/>
            culty, he discovered a place where it was fordable, and <lb/>
            crossed over at the head of sixty bold men-at-arms. They <lb/>
            were charged by a multitude of the enemy, but stoutly held <lb/>
            their ground against the assault. The next day, Lisois <lb/>
            returned and announced his discovery, and the army crossed <lb/>
            the ford without further delay. The road now lay through <lb/>
            forests and marshes, over hills and along valleys, by paths <lb/>
            so narrow that two soldiers could not march abreast. In <note type="footnote">1 The king's half-brother by his mother Arlotta. </note> <pb n="28"/>

            this way they at last reached the neighbourhood of York, <lb/>
            when they learned that the Danes had already retreated. <lb/>
            The king, therefore, detached a body of men-at-arms, with <lb/>
            commanders and officers, to repair the fortresses inside the <lb/>
            city walls, and posted others on the banks of the Humber to <lb/>
            oppose the advance of the Danes ; while he himself con­ <lb/>
            tinued his march through an almost inaccessible country, <lb/>
            overgrown with wood, in the full intention of pursuing the <lb/>
            enemy, without relaxation, into the fastness in which they <lb/>
            lurked. His camps were scattered over a surface of one <lb/>
            hundred miles ; numbers of the insurgents fell beneath his <lb/>
            vengeful sword, he levelled their places of shelter to the <lb/>
            ground, wasted their lands, and burnt their dwellings with <lb/>
            all they contained. Never did William commit so much <lb/>
            cruelty; to his lasting disgrace, he yielded to his worst <lb/>
            impulse, and set no bounds to his fury, condemning the <lb/>
            innocent and the guilty to a common fate. In the fulness <lb/>
            of his wrath he ordered the corn and cattle, with the imple­ <lb/>
            ments of husbandry and every sort of provisions, to be <lb/>
            collected in heaps and set on fire till the whole was con­ <lb/>
            sumed, and thus destroyed at once all that could serve for <lb/>
            the support of life in the whole country lying beyond the <lb/>
            Humber. There followed, consequently, so great a scarcity <lb/>
            in England in the ensuing years, and severe famine involved <lb/>
            the innocent and unarmed population in so much misery, <lb/>
            that, in a Christian nation, more than a hundred thousand <lb/>
            souls, of both sexes and all ages, perished of want.1 On <lb/>
            many occasions, in the course of the present history, I have <lb/>
            been free to extol William according to his merits, but I <lb/>
            dare not commend him for an act which levelled both the <lb/>
            bad and the good together in one common ruin, by the <lb/>
            infliction of a consuming famine. For when I see that <lb/>
            innocent children, youths in the prime of their age, and <lb/>
            grey headed old men, perished from hunger, I am more <lb/>
            disposed to pity the sorrows and sufferings of the wretched <lb/>
            people, than to undertake the hopeless task of screening one <lb/>
            who was guilty of such wholesale massacre by lying Batteries. <lb/>
            I assert, moreover, that such barbarous homicide could not <lb/>
            pass unpunished. The Almighty Judge beholds alike the <note type="footnote"> 1 This famine lasted nine years, but its ravages were most severe in the <lb/>

            high and low, scrutinizing and punishing the acts of both <lb/>
            with equal justice, that his eternal laws may be plain to all.</p>
          <p>While the war was in progres, William ordered the <lb/>
            crown and the other ensigns of royalty, and plate of value, <lb/>
            to be brought from Winchester, aud stationing his army in <lb/>
            camps, went himself to York where he spent the feast of <lb/>
            Christmas. He learnt that a fresh band of the marauders <lb/>
            was lurking in a corner of the country defended on all sides <lb/>
            either by the sea or by marshes. There was only one ac­ <lb/>
            cess to this retreat, by a sound strip of land not more than <lb/>
            twenty feet wide. They had collected abundance of booty, <lb/>
            and lived in perfect security, believing that no force could <lb/>
            hurt them. However, when they heard that the royal troops <lb/>
            were at hand they quickly decamped by night. The indefatiga­ <lb/>
            ble king pursued his desperate foes to the river Tees, through <lb/>
            such difficult roads that he was obliged sometimes to dis­ <lb/>
            mount and march on foot. He remained seven days on the <lb/>
            Tees. There he received the submission of Waltheof in per­ <lb/>
            son, and of Cospatric by his envoys who swore fealty on his <lb/>
            part. Their former allies, the Danes, were now exposed to <lb/>
            great perils, having become wandering pirates, tossed <lb/>
            by the winds and waves. But they suffered no less from <lb/>
            famine than from storms. Part of them perished by <lb/>
            shipwreck ; the rest sustained life by feeding on a misera­ <lb/>
            ble pottage; and these not only common soldiers, but the <lb/>
            princes, earls, and pontiffs. Meat entirely failed, even musty <lb/>
            and putrid as they had long eaten it. They did not venture to <lb/>
            land in search of plunder, nor even touch the shore, so great <lb/>
            was their terror of the inhabitants. At last the small re­ <lb/>
            mains of that powerful fleet sailed back to Denmark, and <lb/>
            carried to Sweyn, their king, a miserable account of all the <lb/>
            misfortunes they had undergone, the savage courage of the <lb/>
            enemy, and the loss of their comrades.</p>
          <p>In the month of January, King William returned from <lb/>
            the Tees to Hexham, by a road hitherto unattempted by <lb/>
            an army, where the peaked summits of the hills and the deep <lb/>
            glens were often covered with snow at a season when the <lb/>
            neighbouring plains were clothed with the verdure of spring. <lb/>
            The king passed it in the depth of winter during a severe <lb/>
            frost, but the troops were encouraged by the cheerfulness <lb/>
            with which he surmounted all obstacles. Still the march <pb n="30"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. CH.V. </note> <lb/>
            was not accomplished without great difficulty and the loss of <lb/>
            a great number of horses. Every one had enough to do in <lb/>
            providing for his own safety without having much concern <lb/>
            for that of his chiefs or his friends. In these straits, the <lb/>
            king lost his way, having no escort but six men-at-arms, and <lb/>
            spent a whole night without knowing where they were. <lb/>
            Having returned to York he repaired the several castles in <lb/>
            that place, and ordered affairs advantageously for the city <lb/>
            and neighbourhood. He then engaged in another expedi­ <lb/>
            tion against the people of Chester and the Welsh, who, in <lb/>
            addition to their other delinquencies, had lately besieged <lb/>
            Shrewsbury. The troops who had just gone through so <lb/>
            much suffering were apprehensive that they would be expo­ <lb/>
            sed to still greater in the present enterprise. They dreaded <lb/>
            the ruggedness of the country, the severity of the winter, <lb/>
            the dearth of provisions, and the terrible fierceness of the <lb/>
            enemy. The soldiers of Anjou, Brittany, and Maine com­ <lb/>
            plained that they were ground down with a service more <lb/>
            intolerable than that of guarding the castles, and made <lb/>
            vehement claims on the king for their discharge. They said, <lb/>
            for their justification, that they could not serve under a lord <lb/>
            who was venturing on enterprises which were unexampled <lb/>
            and out of all reason, nor carry into effect impracticable <lb/>
            orders. The king, in this emergency, imitated the example <lb/>
            of Julius Cæsar, and did not condescend to reconcile them <lb/>
            to his service by earnest entreaties or fresh promises. He <lb/>
            proceeded boldly on his march, commanding the faithful <lb/>
            among his troops to follow him, and giving out that he <lb/>
            cared little for these who would desert him, considering <lb/>
            them as cowards, poltroons, and faint-hearted. He promised <lb/>
            repose to such as contended successfully with the difficulties <lb/>
            they had to surmount, declaring that there was no road to <lb/>
            honour but through toilsome exertions. With unwearied <lb/>
            vigour he made his way through roads never before travelled <lb/>
            by horses, across lofty mountains and deep valleys, rivers <lb/>
            and rapid streams, and dangerous quagmires in the hollows <lb/>
            of the hills. Pursuing their track they were often distressed <lb/>
            by torrents of rain, sometimes mingled with hail. At times <lb/>
            they were reduced to feed on the flesh of horses which <lb/>
            perished in the bogs. The king often led the way on foot <lb/>
            with great agility, and lent a ready hand to assist others in <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D, 1070.] </note> <lb/>
            their dfficulties. At length he conducted his whole force <lb/>
            safely to Chester, and put down all hostile movements <lb/>
            throughout the province of Mercia by the power of a royal <lb/>
            army. He then built a castle at Chester, and another on <lb/>
            his return at Shrewsbury, leaving strong garrisons and <lb/>
            abundant stores of provisions in both. From thence march­ <lb/>
            ing to Salisbury, he recompensed his soldiers for all their <lb/>
            sufferings by an ample distribution of rewards, giving due <lb/>
            praise to all who deserved it, and dismissing them with <lb/>
            many thanks. To mark his displeasure with those who had <lb/>
            threatened desertion, he detained them forty days longer <lb/>
            than their comrades, a slight penalty for men who deserved <lb/>
            a much severer punishment.</p>

          <p>AFTER these events, King William kept the feast of Easter <lb/>
            at Winchester, where certain cardinals of the Roman church <lb/>
            solemnly crowned him. For, at his request, Pope Alexan­ <lb/>
            der had sent over to him, as his most beloved son, three <lb/>
            special legates, Ermenfrid, bishop of Sion,1and two cardinal <lb/>
            canons. He detained them at his court for a year, listening <lb/>
            to and honouring them as if they were the angels of God. <lb/>
            They so ordered affairs with respect to various places and <lb/>
            on several occasions, as to distinguish the districts which <lb/>
            needed canonical examination and orders.</p>
          <p>But what was most important, a numerous synod was <lb/>
            held at Windsor2 in the year of our Lord 1070, at which <lb/>
            the king and the cardinals presided. In this synod, Stigand, <lb/>
            who had been already excommunicated, was deposed. His <lb/>
            hands were stained by perjury and homicide, and he had not <lb/>
            entered on his archiepiscopal functions by the lawful door, <lb/>
            having been raised to his dignity by the two bishops of <lb/>
            Norfolk and Winchester, by the steps of an infamous am­ <lb/>
            bition, and by supplanting others. Some suffragans were <lb/>
            also deposed for having disgraced the episcopal office by <note type="footnote"> I In the Valais. The cardinals' names were Peter and John. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The synod was not held at Windsor but at Winchester, immediately <lb/>

            their criminal life and ignorance of pastoral duties.- Two <lb/>
            Norman prelates, chaplains of the king, were nominated <lb/>
            bishops, Walkelin of Winchester, and Thomas of York;1 the <lb/>
            first in the place of one who was deposed, the second of one <lb/>
            who was dead. Both of these prelates were prudent, full of <lb/>
            gentleness and humanity, venerated and beloved by men, <lb/>
            and venerating and loving God. Others were replaced by <lb/>
            bishops translated from France, men of letters, of excellent <lb/>
            character, and zealous promoters of religion.</p>
          <p>King William exhibited in various ways his desire to <lb/>
            further what was good, and especially he always esteemed <lb/>
            true piety in the servants of God, on which the peace <lb/>
            and prosperity of the world depend. This is abundantly <lb/>
            proved by general report, and it is most clearly esta­ <lb/>
            blished by his actions. When one of the chief shepherds <lb/>
            was at any time removed by death from the scene of his <lb/>
            labours, and the church of God deprived of her ruler was <lb/>
            sorrowing in her widowhood, the careful prince sent pru­ <lb/>
            dent commissioners to the bereaved house, and caused an <lb/>
            inventory to be made of the goods of the church, that they <lb/>
            might not be wasted by sacrilegious guardians. He then <lb/>
            assembled bishops and abbots and other wise counsellors, <lb/>
            and with their assistance made inquiry who was most fit <lb/>
            and proper to have the government of the house of God, <lb/>
            both as regarded its spiritual and temporal wants. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, the person recommended by them for his virtuous <lb/>
            life and proficiency in learning, was appointed by the king's <lb/>
            tender care to the vacant bishopric or abbey. He acted on <lb/>
            this principle during the fifty-six years2 he governed the <lb/>
            dukedom of Normandy and the kingdom of England, leaving <lb/>
            thus an excellent example and pious custom to his suc­ <lb/>
            cessors. He held simony in the utmost detestation, being in­ <lb/>
            fluenced in his choice of abbots and bishops by their sanctity <lb/>
            and wisdom, and not by their wealth or power. He advanced <lb/>
            persons of worth to the government of the English monas- <note type="footnote"> 1 Thomas, archbishop of York, was a native of Bayeux, of which he was <lb/>

            not have exercised much discretion in the choice of bishops and abbots. </note> <pb n="33"/>

            teries; by whose zeal and discipline the monastic rule, which <lb/>
            had somewhat relaxed, became more strict, and, where it <lb/>
            seemed to have failed, was restored to its former vigour.</p>
          <p>It must be recollected that Augustine and Lawrence,1 <lb/>
            and the other first missionaries in England were monks, and, <lb/>
            instead of canons, piously established monks in their episcopal <lb/>
            sees, a system rarely found in other countries. They <lb/>
            founded a number of famous abbeys, and recommended to <lb/>
            their converts monastic institutions both by word and ex­ <lb/>
            ample. This order, therefore, flourished in England with <lb/>
            great lustre for more than two hundred years, and Christian <lb/>
            perfection happily numbered among its votaries the English <lb/>
            kings Ethelbert and Edwin, Oswald and Offa, with many <lb/>
            others, whom it raised for their souls' health to the highest <lb/>
            pitch of virtue, until the time that Edmund, king of the <lb/>
            East-Angles, and two other English kings received martyr­ <lb/>
            dom at the hands of the pagans.2 After that, the Danish <lb/>
            kings, Oskytel and Guthrum, Anwind and Halfdene, Inguar <lb/>
            and Hubba, invaded England with their heathen bands, <lb/>
            giving to the flames the monasteries and churches of the <lb/>
            monks and clergy, and butchering the flock of Christ like <lb/>
            sheep.</p>
          <p>After some years, Alfred king of the Gewisssæ 3 and son <lb/>
            of King Ethelwulph, made a bold stand against the pagans ; <lb/>
            and having, by God's help, slain, expelled, or subjugated his <lb/>
            enemies, was the first of the English kings who united in <lb/>
            his person the monarchy of the whole of England. In my <note type="footnote"> I These missionaries, sent by Pope Gregory the Great, arrived in <lb/>

            his sceptre to his son Edward the elder. When peace and <lb/>
            order were re-established throughout the realm, pious <lb/>
            princes and bishops began to employ themselves in restor­ <lb/>
            ing the monasteries ; and as all the monks in England had <lb/>
            either perished or been driven out by the fury of the hea­ <lb/>
            thens in the troublesome times already mentioned, they <lb/>
            commissioned a young man of high character whose name <lb/>
            was Oswald, to proceed to the abbey of Eleury in France, <lb/>
            built by Leodebod of Orleans on the banks of the Loire in <lb/>
            the time of Clovis, son of Dagobert, king of the Eranks.1 <lb/>
            The place is held in great reverence on account of the bones <lb/>
            of St. Benedict, the founder and master of the monastic <lb/>
            order, which the monk Aigulf sent by the abbot Mummo­ <lb/>
            lus, translated from Beneventum to the country of Orleans.2 <lb/>
            This happened after the devastation of the abbey of Monte <lb/>
            Cassino, which the holy father Benedict foretold with tears <lb/>
            to the monk Theoprobus, a worthy servant of God, as we <lb/>
            read in the second book of the dialogues which Pope <lb/>
            Gregory, the illustrious doctor of the church, so eloquently <lb/>
            addressed to Peter the sub-deacon.3</p>
          <p>After the death of King Clepo, before his son Autarith <lb/>
            was of age to govern, when the whole Lombard nation, <lb/>
            having no king, was subject to thirty-four dukes; some <lb/>
            Lombard brigands made an attack in the night with a view <lb/>
            to plunder and pillage the abbey of Monte Cassino; but all <lb/>
            the monks, by God's protection, escaped in safety with their <lb/>
            Abbot Bonitus. For a hundred and ten years afterwards <lb/>
            the abbey remained desolate, until Petronax, bishop of <lb/>
            Brescia, went there, and by the help of Pope Zachary rebuilt <lb/>
            it in a style of great magnificence, and from that day to this <lb/>
            the abbey of Monte Cassino has continually increased in <lb/>
            splendour.4 During, however, the continuance of the deso- <note type="footnote"> 1 This abbey was founded in the year 641, the fourth of the reign of <lb/>

            lation, and while the abbey was destitute of worshippers, the <lb/>
            house of Fleury was, according to God's will, enriched by <lb/>
            the possession of the precious remains of the illustrious <lb/>
            father Benedict, whose translation the Cisalpine monks <lb/>
            commemorate yearly, with solemn and pious offices, on the <lb/>
            fifth of the ides [11th] of July. To Fleury, therefore, was <lb/>
            the reverend youth Oswald sent, to be professed a monk, <lb/>
            and, being instructed in the monastic rule, order his own <lb/>
            life wellaccording to the will of God, as well as conduct <lb/>
            others who should attach themselves to that discipline, in the <lb/>
            footsteps of the apostles, to the summit of their heavenly <lb/>
            vocation. And so it happened.</p>
          <p>For, after some years, Oswald was sent back to England <lb/>
            by the abbot of Fleury, at the courteous request of his <lb/>
            countrymen, and being distinguished by great sagacity, as <lb/>
            well as excellence, he was placed at the head of all the <lb/>
            monastic institutions in England. -Those venerable men, <lb/>
            Dunstan and Athelwold, seconded him with all their <lb/>
            influence, and their first effort was to introduce the regular <lb/>
            discipline at Glastonbury and Abingdon. These doctors <lb/>
            were faithfully obeyed by Athelstan, Edred, Edmund, and <lb/>
            (especially) Edgar, son of Edmund, kings of England. In <lb/>
            their reigns Dunstan was raised to be metropolitan of <lb/>
            Canterbury, and Athelwold to be bishop of Winchester, and <lb/>
            Oswald became, first, bishop of Worcester and afterwards <lb/>
            archbishop of York. At their entreaty Abbo, a wise and <lb/>
            pious monk of Fleury, was sent over the sea and instituted <lb/>
            the monastic rule at Ramsey,2 and other English monasteries, <lb/>
            after the same manner in which it was practised in France <lb/>
            at that period. He inspired the bishops just named with <note type="footnote"> some time between the death of Clepo, second king of the Lombards, 5th <lb/>
            of January, 575, and his son Autarith coming of age, 584. It appears to <lb/>
            have actually occurred about the year 582, when Bonitus was the sixth <lb/>
            abbot. St. Petronax, who was never a bishop, but abbot of Monte Cassino, <lb/>
            began to restore it from its ruins about the year 720, and died there the <lb/>
            6th of May, 750, or thereabout. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 St. Oswald's residence at Fleury-sur-Loire appears to have been about <lb/>
            the middle of the tenth century; his return to England in 961; his pro­ <lb/>

            archbishopric of York in 970. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The abbey of Ramsey, in Huntingdonshire, was founded by Oswald in <lb/>

            thus rendering great services to men of learning as well as <lb/>
            to the vulgar.</p>
          <p>Bishop Athelwold then restored in the time of King <lb/>
            Edgar, in the town now called Burg, the abbey of Medes­ <lb/>
            hamsted, which bishop Sexulf founded in the reign of <lb/>
            Wulfere, king of the Mercians.1 He also endowed with <lb/>
            great wealth the church dedicated to St. Peter, prince of the <lb/>
            apostles. Afterwards, Thorney abbey, Ely abbey,2 and <lb/>
            many other monasteries, were built in different places; and <lb/>
            societies of monks, clerks, or nuns, were suitably established <lb/>
            in them. Abundant revenues were assigned to each of these <lb/>
            houses, sufficient to supply the servants of the altar with <lb/>
            meat and clothing, in order that they might not fail in the <lb/>
            divine service for want of necessaries.</p>
          <p>Monastic discipline being thus restored in England, a <lb/>
            glorious army of monks was furnished with the arms of the <lb/>
            Spirit to contend against Satan, and taught to persevere in <lb/>
            fighting the Lord's battle until victory was gained. But <lb/>
            after the lapse of some years, in the time of King Ethelred, <lb/>
            son of Edgar, a violent storm rose in the north, to winnow <lb/>
            the wheat in which tares had abundantly multiplied. Sweyn, <lb/>
            king of Denmark, a bigoted idolater, sailed to the coast of <lb/>
            England with a powerful fleet, manned by pagans, and, <lb/>
            making a descent with formidable numbers when it was least <lb/>
            expected, drove the terrified king Ethelred, with his sons <lb/>
            Edward and Alfred, and his queen Emma, to take refuge in <lb/>
            Normandy.3 It was not however long before, by God's <lb/>
            providence, Swcyn, the cruel persecutor of the Christians, <lb/>
            was killed by St. Edmund, and Ethelred, on learning his <lb/>
            death, returned to his own kingdom. Then Canute, king <lb/>
            of Denmark, when he heard his father's fortunes, made <lb/>
            an alliance with Lacman, king of Sweden, and Olave, king of <lb/>
            Norway, and their allied forces landed in England. In the <note type="footnote"> 1 This abbey, afterwards called Peterborough, or Peter's " Burg," was <lb/>

            end, after many defeats, on the death of King Ethelred and <lb/>
            his son Edmund Ironside, he ascended the throne of England, <lb/>
            which he and his sons, Harold and Hardicanute, possessed <lb/>
            for more than forty years.1</p>
          <p>During these events Canterbury, the metropolitan city, <lb/>
            was besieged and burnt, and St. Elphege, the archbishop, <lb/>
            was tortured by the heathen Danes and suffered martyrdom.2 <lb/>
            At that time other cities were also burnt, and episcopal and <lb/>
            abbey churches destroyed, with their sacred books and <lb/>
            ornaments. The flock of the faithful was dispersed by <lb/>
            these storms through various quarters, and dreadfully torn <lb/>
            by the ravages of the wolves, to which it became a prey.</p>
          <p>I have made a long digression, I trust to some advantage, <lb/>
            and collected facts from former annals, for the purpose of <lb/>
            showing to the attentive reader how it was that the <lb/>
            Normans found the people of England so clownish and <lb/>
            almost illiterate, notwithstanding the Roman pontiffs had <lb/>
            long since supplied them with institutions best calculated <lb/>
            for their instruction. Gregory and Boniface had sent <lb/>
            excellent teachers, with sacred books and all the necessaries <lb/>
            for performing the offices of the church for the service of the <lb/>
            English people, and had taught them, as their dear children, <lb/>
            all that was good. After that, Pope Vitalian, in the reigns <lb/>
            of Oswy and Egbert, sent into England those learned men, <lb/>
            Theodore, archbishop, and Adrian, abbot, by whose labours <lb/>
            and intelligence the English clergy were well instructed, <lb/>
            both in Latin and Greek literature, and became much <lb/>
            distinguished. In the next age flourished Abbot Albinus <lb/>
            and Bishop Aldelm, whose learning and piety enlightened <lb/>
            numbers, and whose writings have handed down to posterity <lb/>
            memorable proofs of their virtues.3 All these and many <note type="footnote"> 1 See before, b. i. vol. i. p. 146. The reign of Canute in England lasted <lb/>

            more have been rendered illustrious by the labours of the <lb/>
            eloquent Bede, who has equalled them to the most <lb/>
            accomplished masters of the liberal arts, and inquirers into <lb/>
            the secrets of nature. This venerable man divided the life- <lb/>
            giving bread of the Old and New Testament among the <lb/>
            children of Christ, by his lucid commentaries, explaining in <lb/>
            his works more than sixty mysterious subjects, and thus <lb/>
            gained lasting honour, both in his own and foreign <lb/>
            countries.1</p>
          <p>When the precious stones were happily set in the walls <lb/>
            of the heavenly Jerusalem, and the grains of wheat safely <lb/>
            housed in the garner of the true Joseph, the stones were <lb/>
            scattered in the streets, and the chaff was cast on the dung­ <lb/>
            hill, and carelessly trodden under foot by those who passed <lb/>
            by; Thus, by the just judgment of Almighty God, when <lb/>
            his chosen servants had passed out of this transitory world <lb/>
            to that which is eternal, the Danes, as we have already seen, <lb/>
            restrained by no fear of God or man, long revelled in the <lb/>
            ruin of England, practising, without remorse, innumerable <lb/>
            breaches of the divine law. Human actions, always prone <lb/>
            to evil, become by an infamous course truly abominable, <lb/>
            when rulers, who ought to govern with the rod of discipline, <lb/>
            are taken away. This freedom from control had relaxed <lb/>
            the bonds both of the clergy and laity, and inclined both <lb/>
            sexes to every species of license. The abundance of meat <lb/>
            and drink led to excess, and levity and wantonness paved <lb/>
            the way to crime. With the ruin of the monasteries, <lb/>
            religious discipline was enfeebled, and canonical rules were <lb/>
            not restored till the times of the Normans.</p>
          <p>For a long period the monastic life had fallen into decay <lb/>
            among the islanders, and the lives of monks little differed <lb/>
            from those of men of the world ; their dress and their name <note type="footnote"> ledges the assistance he received from this learned monk in the compilation <lb/>
            of his history. Aldelm, abbot of Malmesbury, became the first bishop of <lb/>
            the new see of Sherborne about the same time, and died in 709. His <lb/>
            works were published in London in 1842, in vols. i. and ii. of Patres <lb/>

            was a mere deception; they were abandoned to gluttony, to <lb/>
            endless peculation, and foul prevarication. By the care of <lb/>
            King William the order was reformed according to the <lb/>
            canonical rules, and its blessed usages being restored, be­ <lb/>
            came highly honoured. Some new abbots were appointed <lb/>
            by the king, and several monks received instruction in the <lb/>
            monasteries of France, who, placed by the king's command <lb/>
            in the English abbeys, perfected the discipline and gave <lb/>
            examples of a religious life. Scolland, an abbot, distin­ <lb/>
            guished for his learning and great worth, was instituted <lb/>
            to the abbey of St. Peter, prince of the apostles, founded by <lb/>
            Augustine, the first doctor of the English nation. Born in <lb/>
            Normandy, of a noble family, and strictly educated at the <lb/>
            monastery of Mount St. Michael the archangel-in-peril-of­ <lb/>
            the-sea, he was preferred by the Normans to be abbot for <lb/>
            the reformation of the monks of Canterbury.1 In like man­ <lb/>
            ner there was a change of rulers in other monasteries, <lb/>
            which in some was profitable, in others dangerous, both to <lb/>
            those who governed and to those who were placed under <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>The see of Canterbury, in which St. Augustine sat, and <lb/>
            which, by a decree of Pope Gregory, obtained the primacy <lb/>
            over all the bishops of Britain, was, on the deposition of <lb/>
            Stigand, committed to Lanfranc, abbot of Caen, by the <lb/>
            choice of the king and all his council. Born of a noble <lb/>
            family, in the city of Pavia, in Italy, he learnt from child­ <lb/>
            hood in the schools the liberal arts, and applied himself <lb/>
            with zeal to the study of the civil law, according to the cus­ <lb/>
            tom of his country, with the intention of continuing a <lb/>
            layman. The youthful orator, when pleading a cause, fre­ <lb/>
            quently triumphed over his veteran opponents, and by a <lb/>
            torrent of eloquence won the prize from men long in the <lb/>
            habit of eloquent speaking. At a ripe age his opinions <lb/>
            were given with so much wisdom, that learned doctors, <lb/>
            judges, and proctors of the city, readily adopted them. But <lb/>
            when in exile, the former academician, like Plato, learnt to <lb/>
            philosophize, the light eternal flashed into his mind, and the <note type="footnote"> 1 He was abbot of St. Peter's of Canterbury before the year 1092, when <lb/>
            he attended the synod at Winchester ; and died in September, 1087. M. <lb/>
            Le Prévost conjectures that he belonged to a Norman family which gave <lb/>
            its name to the village of Pontécoulant, Pons-Scollandi. </note> <pb n="40"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IV. CH.VII."/> <lb/>
            love of true wisdom enlightened his soul. He saw with <lb/>
            Ecclesiastes, though he had not as yet learnt the use of <lb/>
            ecclesiastical writings, that the things of the world are but <lb/>
            vanity. Casting off the world therefore with sovereign con­ <lb/>
            tempt, he took on himself the profession of religion, and <lb/>
            submitted to the yoke of the monastic rule. He selected for <lb/>
            his retreat the abbey of Bee in Normandy, for its secluded <lb/>
            site and poor endowment, enriching it by his prudent and <lb/>
            ever watchful care, and bringing it into a state of the most <lb/>
            perfect order, ruling the brotherhood with a discipline at <lb/>
            once mild and strict, and aiding the holy abbot, Herluins, <lb/>
            with profitable counsel.1 A novice and an exile, while he <lb/>
            mortified himself from sin and the world, and laboured most <lb/>
            for what was spiritual and heavenly, God, the searcher of <lb/>
            hearts, decreed, that his light should be set in a candlestick, <lb/>
            that it might lighten the spacious house of the Lord. <lb/>
            Forced from the quiet of the cloister by his sense of obe­ <lb/>
            dience, he became a master, in whose teaching a whole <lb/>
            library of philosophy and divinity was displayed. He was <lb/>
            a powerful expositor of difficult questions in both sciences. <lb/>
            It was under this master that the Normans received the <lb/>
            first rudiments of literature, and from the school of Bee <lb/>
            that so many philosophers proceeded of distinguished at­ <lb/>
            tainments, both in divine and secular learning. For before, <lb/>
            in the time of six dukes of Normandy, scarce any Norman <lb/>
            devoted himself to liberal studies, nor did any doctor arise <lb/>
            among them until, by the Providence of God, Lanfranc <lb/>
            landed on the shores of Normandy. His reputation for <lb/>
            learning spread throughout all Europe, and many hastened <lb/>
            to receive lessons from him out of France, Gascony, Brit­ <lb/>
            tany, and Flanders.</p>
          <p>To understand the admirable genius and erudition of <lb/>
            Lanfranc, one ought to be an Herodian in grammar, an <lb/>
            Aristotle in dialectics, a Tully in rhetoric, an Augustine <lb/>
            and Jerome, and other expositors of the law and grace, in the <lb/>
            sacred scriptures. Athens itself, in its most flourishing <lb/>
            state, renowned for the excellency of its teaching, would <lb/>
            have honoured Lanfranc in every branch of eloquence and <note type="footnote"> 1 After spending some time at Avranches, Lanfranc came to Bee in <lb/>

            discipline, and would have desired to receive instruction <lb/>
            from his wise maxims. Our monk was full of zeal to cleave <lb/>
            asunder, with the sword of the word, whatever sects at­ <lb/>
            tacked the Catholic faith. In the counsels of Rome and <lb/>
            Vercelli1 he crushed, with the weapons of spiritual elo­ <lb/>
            quence, Berenger of Tours, esteemed by some an heresiarch, <lb/>
            condemning his doctrine, which made the consecrated host <lb/>
            the ruin instead of the salvation of souls. Lanfranc there ex­ <lb/>
            plained, with deep reverence, and most conclusively proved, <lb/>
            that the bread and wine which are placed on the Lord's <lb/>
            table are, after consecration, the true flesh and the true <lb/>
            blood of the Lord our Saviour. He publicly defeated Be­ <lb/>
            renger, after a most elaborate controversy, both at Rome <lb/>
            and at Tours, and compelled him to abjure his heresy, and <lb/>
            to profess in writing the orthodox belief. Afterwards the <lb/>
            blasphemous heretic, blushing for shame at having cast into <lb/>
            the fire at Rome, with his own hands, the books containing <lb/>
            his perverted doctrines, to save himself from being burned, <lb/>
            corrupted his disciples by his money and his deceitful <lb/>
            arguments, to conceal at home his latest writings, and after­ <lb/>
            wards convey them to foreign countries, that his old errors <lb/>
            might receive fresh support, and their duration be extended to <lb/>
            future years. To refute which Lanfranc published a work, <lb/>
            written in a clear and agreeable style, and founded on sacred <lb/>
            authorities, which treats on the subject of the eucharist2 <lb/>
            with the strongest force of reasoning, and while it is lucid <lb/>
            with eloquent discourse, is not prolix and tedious. Many <lb/>
            churches earnestly desired to have Lanfranc for their bishop <lb/>
            or abbot, and even Rome, the capital of Christendom, so­ <lb/>
            licited him by letters to come there, and used prayers and <lb/>
            even force to detain him. So illustrious in the sight of all <note type="footnote"> 1 The two councils here mentioned, in which Lanfranc confuted the <lb/>
            errors of Berenger, archdeacon of Angers, were held in the year 1050, the <lb/>
            first after Easter, and that of Vercelli in the month of September. It is <lb/>
            very doubtful whether Lanfranc assisted at the council of Tours, but he <lb/>
            was present at that of Rome in April, 1059, when Berenger was compelled <lb/>
            to abjure his errors. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Lanfranc's principal work against this heretic, to which he gave the <lb/>

          <p>When the bishop of Sion had deposed Stigand, as before <lb/>
            related, he invited Lanfranc to undertake the primacy, and <lb/>
            announced to him the petition of the church of God in a <lb/>
            synod of the bishops and abbots of Normandy. Lanfranc, <lb/>
            in much distress of mind, and fearing to take on himself so <lb/>
            great a charge, begged for time to consider, holding it for <lb/>
            certain that the retirement of a monk and the active duties <lb/>
            of an archbishop could not be reconciled. Abbot Herluin <lb/>
            laid his commands upon him, and he was accustomed to <lb/>
            obey him as he would Christ. The queen and her son the <lb/>
            prince entreated him; the elders of the council also who <lb/>
            were assembled earnestly exhorted him. He would not <lb/>
            give a hasty reply, because every word and act of his was <lb/>
            guided by the rule of discretion. He was unwilling to for­ <lb/>
            feit his obedience, and to offend those who entreated, per­ <lb/>
            suaded, admonished him. He, therefore, mournfully crossed <lb/>
            the sea to make his excuses, hoping for a happy return. The <lb/>
            king cordially received his coadjutor in Christian culture, <lb/>
            and, combating with dignity and grace the excuses his humi­ <lb/>
            lity offered, succeeded in overcoming his reluctance.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord, 1070, Lanfranc, the first abbot <lb/>
            of Caen,1 was sent by divine providence, to become the <lb/>
            teacher of the English, and after a canonical election, and <lb/>
            lawful consecration enthroned in the archiepiscopal see of <lb/>
            the church of Canterbury on the fourth of the calends of <lb/>
            September [August 29th.] A number of bishops and <lb/>
            abbots, with a great concourse of the clergy and people, were <lb/>
            present at the ceremony. The inhabitants of the whole of <lb/>
            England, whether present or absent, were raised to the <lb/>
            highest pitch of joy, and would indeed have offered bound­ <lb/>
            less thanks to God if they had known how much good <lb/>
            Heaven was then bestowing upon them.</p>
          <p>In the church of Caen, Lanfranc was succeeded by <lb/>
            William, son of Radbod, bishop of Séez, who, I think, nine <lb/>

            bishop of Evreux, son of Girard Fleitel, the influence of <lb/>
            which family was extremely'powerful in Normandy in the <lb/>
            time of the Richards.1 As canon and archdeacon of Rouen <lb/>
            he was under Maurilius, archbishop of that see, and <lb/>
            becoming more ardent in his love of God, he went abroad <lb/>
            with Theodoric, abbot of St. Evroult, devoutly making a <lb/>
            pilgrimage to the glorious sepulchre of our Lord at Jerusa­ <lb/>
            lem. After his return, being apprehensive of losing the <lb/>
            fruit of his former labours, he withdrew altogether from the <lb/>
            temptations of the world, and devoted himself with delight <lb/>
            to his holy warfare in the abbey of Bee. He was afterwards <lb/>
            sent with Lanfranc to instruct the novices who assembled <lb/>
            from all parts for the service of Christ in the city of Caen, <lb/>
            and in the course of time became their worthy father and <lb/>
            superior.</p>
          <p>At the death of William, bishop of Evreux, he was suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded by Baldwin, the duke's chaplain, who regularly <lb/>
            governed the bishopric nearly seven years. At his decease <lb/>
            Gislebert Fitz-Osbern, canon and archdeacon of Lisieux, <lb/>
            became his successor. He held the see to its great benefit <lb/>
            more than thirty years, augmenting its revenues in various <lb/>
            ways, and skilfully regulating its affairs. On the death of <lb/>
            Ives, bishop of Séez, Robert, son of Hubert de Rie, succeeded <lb/>
            him, governing the see nearly twelve years, and being him­ <lb/>

            distance, the cultivators of the soil renewed their labours in <lb/>
            some sort of security. The English and Normans lived <lb/>
            amicably together in the villages, towns, and cities, and <lb/>
            intermarriages between them formed bonds of mutual <lb/>
            alliance. Then might be seen in some of the towns and <lb/>
            country fairs French traders with the merchandize they <lb/>
            imported, and the English, who before in their homely dress <lb/>
            cut a sorry figure in the eyes of the Normans, appeared in <lb/>
            their foreign garb a different people. No one dared any <lb/>
            longer to live by robbery, but all cultivated their lands in <lb/>
            safety, and, though this did not last long, lived happily with <lb/>
            their neighbours. Churches were built and repaired, and <lb/>
            the ministers of religion zealously performed in them the <lb/>
            service of God. The king's great activity watched over the <lb/>
            public good, and roused the people by all possible means to <lb/>
            profitable pursuits. He took some pains to make himself <lb/>
            master of the English language, to enable himself to hear <lb/>
            the complaints of his subjects without an interpreter, and <lb/>
            to render equal justice to all according to the rules of <lb/>
            equity; but his time of life rendered this study a work of <lb/>
            difficulty, and his attention was necessarily diverted to <lb/>
            other objects by the multiplicity of his occupations.'</p>

            so that the relentless furies were again let loose, and for a <lb/>
            long period wrought endless mischief. This originated in <lb/>
            the evil counsels which led King William, much to the <lb/>
            injury of his reputation, to a breach of faith in shutting up <lb/>
            the illustrious earl Morcar, in the Isle of Ely, where he was <lb/>

            differences were fomented by wily newsmongers, who went <lb/>
            to and fro propounding the treacherous terms that the carl <lb/>
            should surrender himself to the king, and the king restore <lb/>
            him to his favour as a trusty adherent. The earl might <lb/>
            have defended himself for a considerable time in his inac­ <lb/>
            cessible retreat, or when things came to the worst, have <lb/>
            taken advantage of the river which surrounded it to escape <lb/>
            by sea. But weakly listening to false representations, he <lb/>
            left the island, and came to court with his attendants in <lb/>
            peaceable guise. The king, however, was apprehensive that <lb/>
            Morcar would avenge the evils unjustly inflicted on himself <lb/>
            and his countrymen, and be the means of raising endless <lb/>
            disturbances in his English dominions; he, therefore, threw <lb/>
            him into prison without any distinct charge, and committing <lb/>
            him to the custody of Roger de Beaumont, confined him in <lb/>
            his castle all the rest of his life.1 When Earl Edwin, that <lb/>
            handsome youth, heard of his brother's imprisonment, he <lb/>
            declared that he would prefer death to life unless he could <lb/>
            deliver Morcar from captivity, or have his revenge by a <lb/>
            plentiful effusion of Norman bloody For six months he <lb/>
            solicited aid from the Scotch, the Welsh, and the English. <lb/>
            Meanwhile three brothers who were admitted to his fami­ <lb/>
            liarity, and were his principal attendants, betrayed him to <lb/>
            the Normans, assassinating him, though he made a despe­ <lb/>
            rate defence at the head of twenty men-at-arms. The high <lb/>
            tide, which rendered it necessary for Edwin to halt on the <lb/>
            bank of a stream, aided the Normans in perpetrating this <lb/>
            outrage, by cutting off his retreat. The report of Edwin's <lb/>
            death, spread throughout the kingdom, was the cause of <lb/>
            deep sorrow, not only to the English, but even to the Nor­ <lb/>
            mans and French, who lamented his loss like that of a friend <note type="footnote"> 1 Ordericus has not related these circumstances quite correctly. King <lb/>
            William did not shut up Morcar in the Isle of Ely, but the earl retired <lb/>
            there, and took refuge with Hereward to escape the king's persecutions. <lb/>
            We find that he was committed to the custody of Roger de Beaumont, <lb/>
            who probably guarded him in one of his castles of Beaumont, Brionne, or <lb/>
            Pontaudemer. Morcar was restored to liberty by the Conqueror on his <lb/>

            imitating the style of Sallust, eloquently and acutely recounts <lb/>
            the acts of King William. This author was by birth a <lb/>
            Norman, being a native of the town of Préaux,2 where his <lb/>
            sister was abbess of a convent of nuns dedicated to St. <lb/>
            Leger. He is called William of Poitiers, because in that <lb/>
            city he drank deeply at the fountain of learning. Returning <lb/>
            into his own country, he became eminent as the most <lb/>
            learned of all his neighbours and fellow students, and made <lb/>
            himself useful to Hugh and Gislebert, bishops of Lisieux, in <lb/>
            ecclesiastical affairs, as archdeacon of that diocese. He had <lb/>
            served with courage in a military career before he took <lb/>
            orders, fighting bravely for his earthly sovereign, so that he <lb/>
            was the better able to describe with precision the scenes of <lb/>
            war, from having himself been present and encountered <lb/>
            their perils. As age came on he devoted himself to science <lb/>
            and prayer, and was more capable of composing in prose or <lb/>
            verse than of preaching. He frequently wrote clever and <lb/>
            agreeable poems, adapted for recitation, submitting them <lb/>
            without jealousy to the correction of his juniors. I have <lb/>
            briefly followed, in many parts, his narrative of King Wil­ <lb/>

          <p>The two great earls of the Mercians having been got rid <lb/>
            of, Edwin by death, and Morcar by strict confinement, King <lb/>
            William distributed their vast domains in the richest <lb/>
            districts of England among his adherents, raising the lowest <lb/>
            of his Norman followers to wealth and power. He granted <lb/>
            the Isle of Wight and the county of Hereford to William <lb/>
            Fitz-Osbern, high-steward of Normandy, giving him the <lb/>
            charge, in conjunction with Walter de Lacy and other tried <lb/>
            soldiers, of defending the frontier against the Welsh, who <lb/>
            were breathing defiance. Their first expedition was a bold <lb/>
            attack on the people of Brecknock, in which the Welsh <lb/>
            princes, Rhys, Cadogan, and Meredith,1 with many others, <lb/>
            were defeated. The king had already granted the city and <lb/>
            county of Chester to Gberbod of Flanders, who had been <lb/>
            greatly harassed by the hostilities both of the English and <lb/>
            Welsh. Afterwards, being summoned by a message from his <lb/>
            dependants in Flanders, to whom he had entrusted his <lb/>
            hereditary domains, he obtained leave from the king to <lb/>
            make a short visit to that country, but while there his evil <lb/>
            fortune led him into a snare, and, falling into the hands of <lb/>
            his enemies, and thrown into a dungeon, he had to endure <lb/>
            the sufferings of a long captivity, cut off from all the <lb/>
            blessings of life. In consequence, the king gave the earldom <lb/>
            of Chester to Hugh d'Avranches, son of Richard surnamed <lb/>
            Goz, who, in concert with Robert of Rhuddlan, and Robert <lb/>
            of Malpas, and other fierce knights, made great slaughter <lb/>
            among the Welsh. This Hugh was not merely liberal but <lb/>
            prodigal; not satisfied with being surrounded by his own <lb/>
            retainers, he kept an army on foot. He set no bounds <lb/>
            either to his generosity or his rapacity. He continually <note type="footnote"> 1 Rhys-ap-Owen, Cadogan-ap-Blethyn, and Meredith-ap-Owen. Orde­ <lb/>

            and others he has named before. Shrewsbury, the seat of his fathers patron, <lb/>
            Roger, earl of Montgomery, was a frontier garrison, intended, like those <lb/>

            wasted even his own domains, and gave more encouragement <lb/>
            to those who attended him in hawking and hunting, than <lb/>
            to the cultivators of the soil, and the votaries of heaven. <lb/>
            He indulged in gluttony to such a degree as to become so <lb/>
            fat that lie could scarcely walk. He abandoned himself <lb/>
            immoderately to carnal pleasures, and bad a numerous <lb/>
            offspring of both sexes by his concubines, but they have <lb/>
            almost all been carried off by one misfortune or another. <lb/>
            He married Ermentrude, daughter of Hugh de Clermont, in <lb/>
            the Beauvais, by whom he had Richard, who succeeded him as <lb/>
            his heir in the earldom of Chester, and when yet young and <lb/>
            childless perished by shipwreck in company with William, <lb/>
            son and heir apparent of Henry, king of England, and many <lb/>
            of the nobility, on the seventh of the calends of November <lb/>
            [26th October].1</p>
          <p>King William gave first to Roger de Montgomery the castle <lb/>
            of Arundel and the city of Chichester, and afterwards the <lb/>
            earldom of Shrewsbury,2 which town is situated on a hill by <lb/>
            the river Severn. This earl was wise, moderate, and a lover <lb/>
            of justice; and cherished the gentle society of intelligent and <lb/>
            unassuming men. For a long time he had about him three <lb/>
            well-informed clerks, Godebald, Odelirius,3 and Herbert, <lb/>
            whose advice he followed with great advantage. He gave <lb/>
            his niece Emerie and the command of Shrewsbury to <lb/>
            Warin the Bald,4 a man of small stature but great courage, <lb/>
            who bravely encountered the earl's enemies, and maintained <lb/>
            tranquillity throughout the district entrusted to his <lb/>
            government. Roger de Montgomery also gave commands in <lb/>
            his earldom to William, surnamed Pantoul, Picot de Say, and <lb/>
            Corbet,5 with his sons Roger and Robert, as well as other <note type="footnote"> I Our author gives a full account, in the twelfth book of this history, of <lb/>

          <p>King William conferred the earldom of Northampton on <lb/>
            Waltheof, son of Earl Siward,1 the most powerful of the <lb/>
            English nobility, and, in order to cement a firm alliance with <lb/>
            him, gave him in marriage his niece Judith,2 who bore him <lb/>
            two beautiful daughters. The earldom of Buckingham was <lb/>
            given to Walter Giftard,3 and Surrey to William de <lb/>
            Warrenne, who married Gundred, Gherbod's sister. King <lb/>
            William granted the earldom of Holdernesse to Eudes, of <lb/>
            Champagne, nephew of Count Theobald, who married the <lb/>
            king's sister, that is, Duke Robert's daughter;4 and the <lb/>
            earldom of Norwich to Ralph de Guader, son-in-law of <lb/>
            William Fitz-Osbern. To Hugh Grantmesnil he granted <lb/>
            the town of Leicester, and distributed cities and comities <lb/>
            among other lords, with great honours and domains. The <lb/>
            castle of Tutbury, which Hugh d'Avranches before held, he <lb/>
            granted to Henry, son of Walkelin de Ferrers,5 conferring on <lb/>
            other foreigners who had attached themselves to his <lb/>
            fortunes, such vast possessions that they had in England <lb/>
            many vassals more rich and powerful than their own fathers <lb/>
            ever were in Normandy.</p>
          <p>What shall I say of Odo, bishop of Baieux, who was earl <lb/>
            palatine, and generally dreaded by the English people, <lb/>
            issuing his orders everywhere like a second king. He had <lb/>
            the command over all the earls and barons of the realm, <note type="footnote"> South Wales. It appears by Domesday Book, that Roger Corbet held <lb/>

            obtained the crown of eternal life by their obedience to the <lb/>

            more occupied with worldly affairs than in the exercise of <lb/>

            Odo, who, with violence and injustice, robbed them of the <lb/>

            English wealth, while her sons were iniquitously slain, or <lb/>
            driven into hopeless exile in foreign lands. It is stated that <lb/>

            O mortals! blind of fate, who never know <lb/>
            To bear high fortune, or endure the low.2 <lb/>
            Young women of high rank were subject to the insults of <lb/>
            grooms, and mourned their dishonour by filthy ruffians. <lb/>
            Matrons, distinguished by their birth and elegance, lamented <lb/>
            in solitude; and, bereaved of their husbands and deprived of <lb/>

            strength, but by the providence of God, who ordereth all <lb/>

          <p>Some churchmen, who, to all appearance, were wise and <lb/>
            religious, constantly followed the court, and became abject <lb/>
            flatterers, to the no small disgrace of their Christian pro­ <lb/>
            fession, that they might obtain the dignities they coveted. <lb/>
            As the hire for their services is demanded of princes by <lb/>
            newly enlisted soldiers, so some of the laity repaid the <lb/>
            clergy for paying them court by gifts of bishoprics and <lb/>
            abbeys, wardenships, archdeaconries, deaneries, and other <lb/>
            offices of power and dignity, which ought to be conferred <lb/>
            for the merits of holiness and learning. The clergy and <lb/>
            monks now attached themselves to an earthly prince to <lb/>
            obtain such rewards, and, for their worldly advantage, lent <lb/>
            themselves without decency to a service which was incom­ <lb/>
            patible with their spiritual duties. The old abbots were <lb/>
            terrified by the threats of secular power, and, unjustly <lb/>
            driven from their seats without the sentence of a synod, to <lb/>
            make way for hirelings, who, more tyrants than monks, were <lb/>
            intruded in their places. Then such traffic and agreements <lb/>
            took place between prelates of this class and the flocks com­ <lb/>
            mitted to their charge, as may be supposed between wolves <lb/>
            and sheep having no protector. This may be easily proved <lb/>
            by what happened in the case of Turstin, of Caen, and the <lb/>
            convent of Glastonbury.2 This shameless abbot, attempting <lb/>
            to compel the monks of Glastonbury to disuse the chant <lb/>
            which had been introduced into England by the disciples or <lb/>
            the blessed Pope Gregory, and to adopt the chant of the <lb/>
            Flemings or Normans, which they had never learned or <lb/>
            heard before, a violent tumult arose, which ended in <lb/>
            disgrace to the holy order. For when the monks refused <lb/>
            new fashions, and their haughty superior persisted in his <lb/>
            obstinacy, all of a sudden, laymen, armed with spears, came <lb/>
            to their master's aid, and surrounding the monks severely <lb/>
            beat some of them, and, as report says, mortally wounded <lb/>
            them. I could relate many such instances, if they would <lb/>

          <p>Guitmond was a venerable monk of the monastery called La <lb/>
            Croix d'Helton, where we read that Leudfred, the glorious <lb/>
            confessor of Christ, happily served the Lord forty-eight years <lb/>
            in the reigns of Childebert and Chilperic.1 Guitmond <lb/>
            crossed the sea on a royal summons, and was offered by the <lb/>
            king and great men of the realm a high ecclesiastical office, <lb/>
            but he positively refused to undertake the charge. He was <lb/>
            in the prime of years, devout and deeply learned; having <lb/>
            left to the world a remarkable proof of bis genius in the book <lb/>
            he wrote against Berenger, On the Body and Blood of our <lb/>
            Lord,2 as well as in his other works. When the king <lb/>
            entreated him to remain in England until he should have an <lb/>
            opportunity of suitably promoting him, Guitmond took time <lb/>
            to consider the matter carefully, and pointed out how much <lb/>
            his own views differed from the proposal which had been <lb/>
            made, in a long letter replying to the king to the following <lb/>
            effect :­</p>
          <p>" I am averse to undertaking any ecclesiastical function for <lb/>
            many reasons, which 1 am not willing, nor would it become <lb/>
            me, fully to detail. In the first place, when I consider well <lb/>
            the infirmities, both bodily and mental, which I continually <lb/>
            suffer, I painfully feel my inability to undergo the scrutiny <lb/>
            of the divine Judge, for even now I lament that in my daily <lb/>
            struggles to keep the path of life I am in continual danger <lb/>
            of erring from the truth. But if I cannot safely rule my­ <lb/>
            self, how shall I be able to direct the course of others in <lb/>
            the way to salvation ? Besides, after carefully considering <lb/>
            all circumstances, I do not see by what means I can fitly <lb/>
            undertake the government of a community whose foreign <lb/>
            manners and barbarous language are strange to me ; a <lb/>
            wretched people, whose fathers and near relations and <lb/>
            friends have either fallen by your sword, or have been disin­ <lb/>
            herited by you, driven into exile, imprisoned, or subjected <lb/>
            to an unjust and intolerable slavery. Search the scriptures <note type="footnote"> 1 La Croix St. Leufroi, between Evreux and Gaillon, in the diocese of <lb/>

            and see if there be any law by which a pastor chosen by <lb/>
            enemies can be intruded by violence on the Lord's flock. <lb/>
            Every ecclesiastical election ought to be purely made in the <lb/>
            first instance by the society of the faithful who are to be <lb/>
            governed, and then confirmed by assent of the fathers of <lb/>
            the church and their friends, if it be canonical; if not, it <lb/>
            should be rectified in a spirit of charity. How can that <lb/>
            which you have wrung from the people by war and bloodshed <lb/>
            be innocently conferred on myself and others who despise <lb/>
            the world and have voluntarily stripped ourselves of our own <lb/>
            substance for Christ sake ? It is the general rule of all who <lb/>
            take religious vows to have no part in robbery, and, for the <lb/>
            maintenance of justice, to reject offerings which are the <lb/>
            fruits of pillage. For the scripture saith : ' The sacrifice of <lb/>
            injustice is a polluted offering; and a little afterwards: <lb/>
            ' Whoso offereth a sacrifice of the substance of the poor is <lb/>
            like one that slayeth a son in his father's sight.'1 Reflecting on <lb/>
            these and other precepts of the divine law, I cannot but <lb/>
            tremble. I look upon England as altogether one vast heap <lb/>
            of booty, and I am afraid to touch it and its treasures as if <lb/>
            it were a burning fire. As God commands every man to <lb/>
            love his neighbour as himself, I will tell you sincerely what <lb/>
            I learn from divine inspiration : what I think profitable for <lb/>
            myself is also for your good. Let not that which is spoken <lb/>
            in friendship be considered offensive; but do you, brave <lb/>
            prince, and your fellow soldiers, who have encountered with <lb/>
            you the greatest perils, receive with kindness the expression <lb/>
            of my advice. Reflect every day of your lives on the <lb/>
            operations of the Lord, and in all your undertakings have <lb/>
            his judgments, which are incomprehensible, before your eyes, <lb/>
            so weighing your course of life in the scales of justice accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the will of God, that the righteous Judge, who orders <lb/>
            all things rightly, may be merciful to you in the day of <lb/>
            doom. Let not flatterers betray you into a deceitful secu­ <lb/>
            rity, and from the success which has attended you in the <lb/>
            present life lull you into the death-sleep of worldly prospe­ <lb/>
            rity. Vaunt not yourself that the English have been <lb/>
            conquered by your arms, but gird yourself carefully for that <lb/>
            more difficult and dangerous combat with your spiritual <lb/>
            enemies which still remains and is to be fought daily. The <note type="footnote"> 1 Ecclus. xxxiv. 21 and 24. </note> <pb n="55"/>

            revolutions of earthly kingdoms are exhibited in the pages <lb/>
            of scripture in which the knowledge of past events is <lb/>
            livinely furnished. The Babylonians, under their king <lb/>
            Nebuchodnosor, subdued Judea, Egypt, and many other <lb/>
            countries but seventy years afterwards they were themselves <lb/>
            conquered aud subjugated by the Medes and Persians under <lb/>
            Darius and his grandson Cyrus. Two hundred and thirty <lb/>
            years afterwards, the Macedemonians, under the command of <lb/>
            Alexander the Great, defeated Darius the king of Persia and <lb/>
            hs innumerable hosts ; and many years afterwards, when the <lb/>
            Romans sent forth their legions into every quarter of the <lb/>
            globe, the Parthians were utterly subdued under their king <lb/>
            Perseus. The Greeks, led by Agamemnon and the son of <lb/>
            Palamede, laid siege to Troy, and having slain the king <lb/>
            Priamus, son of Laomedon, and his sons Hector and Troilus, <lb/>
            Paris, Deiphobus and Amphimacus, after a ten years' siege, <lb/>
            lestroyed with fire and sword the famous kingdom of <lb/>
            Phrygia. A remnant of the Trojans, with Eneas for their <lb/>
            chief, established themselves in Italy ; another band, under <lb/>
            the command of Antenor, after a long and difficult journey, <lb/>
            reached Denmark, and made a settlement there which their <lb/>
            posterity inhabit to the present time. The kingdom of Je­ <lb/>
            rusalem, enriched by David and his powerful successors with <lb/>
            the spoils of other nations and aggrandized by their conquest <lb/>
            of the surrounding barbarous tribes, was overturned by the <lb/>
            Romans in the reigns of Vespasian and Titus, and the stately <lb/>
            temple of the Jews destroyed one thousand and eighty-nine <lb/>
            years after its foundation, eleven hundred thousand Jews <lb/>
            perishing by the sword or famine. The Franks formed an <lb/>
            alliance with the Gauls in the time of their duke Sunno, and <lb/>
            having resolutely shaken off the Roman yoke began to lord <lb/>
            over them. It is now almost six hundred years since the <lb/>
            Anglo-Saxons, under their chiefs Hengist and Horsa, <lb/>
            wrested by force or fraud the government of Britain from <lb/>
            the natives now called Welsh. The Guinili, driven by chance <lb/>
            from the Scandinavian island invaded that part of Italy now <lb/>
            called Lombardy in the reign of Alboin, son of Audo, and, long <lb/>
            resisting the Romans, have held possession of it to the pre­ <lb/>
            sent day. All these great men whom I have described, <lb/>
            as elated by victory, not long afterwards miserably perished, <lb/>
            and together with their victims are subject to endless tor- <pb n="56"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IV. CH.VIII. </note> <lb/>
            tures, under which they groan in the noisome caverns of hell. <lb/>
            The Normans, under their chief Rollo, wrested Neustria from <lb/>
            Charles the Simple, and have now held it for one hundred <lb/>
            and ninety years,1 against all the efforts of the French, not­ <lb/>
            withstanding their frequent attacks. Need I speak of the <lb/>
            Gepidi and the Vandals, the Goths and the Turks, the <lb/>
            Huns and the IIeruli, and other barbarous nations ? Their <lb/>
            whole business is to ravage and rob, and to tread under foot <lb/>
            every vestige of peace. They lay waste the soil, burn <lb/>
            houses, disturb the world, scatter the means of subsistence, <lb/>
            butcher the population, spread every where barbarism and <lb/>
            confusion. Such signs as these are omens of the end of <lb/>
            the world, as we are plainly told in the word of truth: <lb/>
            ' Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against <lb/>
            kingdom; and there shall be great earthquakes in divers <lb/>
            places, and famines and pestilences: and fearful sights and <lb/>
            great signs shall there be from heaven.'2 <lb/>
            So sinks the reeling world with woes oppressed.</p>
          <p>"Reflecting thoughtfully on these and such like revolutions <lb/>
            in human affairs, let not the conqueror glory in the ruin of <lb/>
            his rivals; for he himself shall hold his footing no longer <lb/>
            than his Maker wills. I will now, O king, apply what I <lb/>
            have said to your own case, beseeching you to listen to me <lb/>
            with patience for your soul's sake. Before you, no one of <lb/>
            your race obtained the kingly dignity; that high honour <lb/>
            did not accrue to you by inheritance, but by the free gift of <lb/>
            Almighty God, and the kind preference of your kinsman <lb/>
            King Edward. Edgar Atheling and many other scions of <lb/>
            the royal stock, are, according to the laws of the Hebrews <lb/>
            and other nations, nearer in degree than yourself as heirs <lb/>
            to the crown of England. They have been set aside by the <lb/>
            lot which has led to your advancement: but the more <lb/>
            mysterious is God's providence, the more terrible is the <lb/>
            account you will have to give of the stewardship committed <lb/>
            to you. 1 submit these considerations to your highness <note type="footnote"> I Without its being necessary to follow the venerable monk through all <lb/>
            his historical disquisitions, it may be proper to remark that this calculation <lb/>
            would carry back the grant of territory made by Charles the Simple to <lb/>

            with the fullest good wishes, humbly beseeching you to be <lb/>
            ever mindful of what must come at last, and not to be <lb/>
            wholly engrossed with present prosperity, which is too often <lb/>
            followed by intolerable suffering, wailing, and gnashing of <lb/>
            teeth. And now I commit you, your friends and followers, <lb/>
            to the grace of God, intending, with your permission, to <lb/>
            return to Normandy, and leave the rich spoils of England <lb/>
            to the lovers of this world, as dross and dung. I truly pre­ <lb/>
            fer, for my part, that poverty for the love of Christ which <lb/>
            was the choice of Anthony and Benedict, above all the <lb/>
            riches of the world which were the coveted portion of <lb/>
            Croesus and Sardanapalus, and when they afterwards <lb/>
            miserably perished, became the spoils of their enemies. <lb/>
            Christ, the good shepherd, has uttered the warning : 'Woe <lb/>
            to the rich of this world,' who enjoy here vain and super­ <lb/>
            fluous luxuries, while he promised the blessings of the world <lb/>
            to come to the poor in spirit; which may He vouchsafe to <lb/>
            grant us, who liveth and reigneth through all ages. Amen."</p>
          <p>The king, who with his great lords admired the firmness <lb/>
            of the venerable monk, treated him with deference, and <lb/>
            taking leave of him with marked respect, commanded him, <lb/>
            with fitting honours, to return to Normandy, and there wait <lb/>
            his own presence where he pleased. When Guitmond re­ <lb/>
            turned to the enclosure of his own monastery, it was noised <lb/>
            abroad that he had preferred monastic poverty to episcopal <lb/>
            wealth, and further, that he had in the presence of the king <lb/>
            and his nobles stigmatized the conquest of England with <lb/>
            the character of robbery, and accused of rapacity all the <lb/>
            bishops and abbots who had obtained preferment in England <lb/>
            against the feeling of the natives. These allegations of his <lb/>
            becoming known throughout the kingdom, and causing much <lb/>
            discussion, were very distasteful to numerous persons who <lb/>
            being little disposed to follow his example, were extremely <lb/>
            exasperated by what he had said. Not long afterwards, on <lb/>
            the death of John, archbishop of Rouen, the king and others <lb/>
            selected G-uitmond for his successor; but his enemies, the <lb/>
            men he had so severely rebuked, did all in their power to <lb/>
            hinder his preferment. They found nothing, however, to <lb/>
            object to, in a man of his worth, but that he-was the son of <lb/>
            a priest. Upon this, Gruitmond, wishing to be clear of all <lb/>
            suspicion of covetousness, and preferring to suffer poverty in <pb n="58"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IV. CH. VIII."/> <lb/>
            a foreign country, rather than foment disturbances in his own, <lb/>
            applied respectfully to Odilo, the abbot of his monastery, and <lb/>
            humbly petitioned for permission to travel abroad, which was <lb/>
            granted.1 This illiterate abbot little knew what treasures <lb/>
            of wisdom were concealed under the humble exterior of the <lb/>
            learned monk, and so he made no difficulty in parting with <lb/>
            a philosopher of inestimable worth, who was received with <lb/>
            joy by Pope Gregory VII. on his arrival at Rome, and made <lb/>
            a cardinal of the holy Roman church, and by Pope Urban, <lb/>
            after experience of his abilities, solemnly consecrated metro­ <lb/>
            politan of Aversa.2 That city, built in the time of Leo IX., <lb/>
            by the Normans when they first settled in Apulia was called <lb/>
            Adversa by the Romans, because it was founded by <lb/>
            their adversaries. Abounding in wealth, powerful from the <lb/>
            warlike character of its Cisalpine inhabitants,3 formidable <lb/>
            to its enemies, and respected by its faithful subjects and <lb/>
            allies, that city, by the determination of the Normans, was <lb/>
            immediately dependent in ecclesiastical affairs on the pope <lb/>
            himself, from whom it received the philosopher Guitmond, <lb/>
            honoured with the mystical decoration of the pallium, as its <lb/>
            bishop. This prelate long governed the church entrusted <lb/>
            to his care, enjoying the apostolical privileges of his see free <lb/>
            from all the exactions of men. Having diligently taught <lb/>
            his flock, and given them the protection of his merits and <lb/>
            prayers, after many struggles in the exercise of his virtues <lb/>
            he departed in the Lord.4 <note type="footnote"> 1 It could not be the result of this affair which induced Guitmond to <lb/>
            leave Normandy, for he went to Italy in 1077, and John d'Avranches did <lb/>
            not die till 1079. It may even be doubted whether William proposed to <lb/>
            prefer him to the archbishopric of Rouen two years after he had entirely <lb/>
            renounced his country to attach himself altogether to the court of Rome. <lb/>
            He went so far as even to change his name, and adopt that of Christian or <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CH. IX. Affairs of Flanders- William Fitz-Osbern killed in battle there-King William crosses over to Nor­ mandy.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN the fifth year of his reign King William sent William <lb/>
            Fitz-Osbern to Normandy to assist Queen Matilda in the <lb/>
            defence of the duchy. At that time there was great con­ <lb/>
            tention in Flanders between the heirs to that province. <lb/>
            Baldwin, son-in-law of Robert king of France, and count of <lb/>
            Flanders, of distinguished bravery had by his wife Adela <lb/>
            several sons and daughters of great merit. Robert, the <lb/>
            Frisian, Arnold, Baldwin, Odo, archbishop of Treves, Henry <lb/>
            the clerk, Queen Matilda, and Judith, wife of Earl Tostig, were <lb/>
            all children of Baldwin and Adela.1 Their characters and <lb/>
            the various occurrences of their lives, would furnish histo­ <lb/>
            rians with matter for extended works. Robert the eldest, <lb/>
            having offended his father, and being banished by him, <lb/>
            sought the court of Florence, duke of Frisia, his father's <lb/>
            enemy, and, in reward for his services, received his <lb/>
            daughter's hand in marriage; at this the duke of Flanders <lb/>
            was much incensed and in his anger gave his son Robert <lb/>
            the name of the Frisian, and, proclaiming him an outlaw, <lb/>
            appointed his second son Arnold his heir. A short time <lb/>
            afterwards, Duke Baldwin died, and Arnold held Flanders <lb/>
            for a short time. But Robert the Frisian invaded it vigo­ <lb/>
            rously with a large body of Frisian and other troops. Philip <lb/>
            king of France, who was their kinsman, came to the aid of <lb/>
            Arnold, with a French army, summoning Earl William <lb/>
            [Fitz-Osbern] to attend him as governor of Normandy. <lb/>
            But Earl William joined the king with only ten men-at- <lb/>
            arms, and rode with him gaily to Flanders, as if he was only <lb/>
            going to a tournament. Meanwhile, Robert the Frisian, <lb/>
            had united his forces with those of the emperor, and on Sep­ <lb/>
            tuagesima Sunday, the tenth of the calends of March [20th <lb/>
            of February], attacked the enemy by surprise early in the <lb/>
            morning, and Philip, king of France, and his army flying, <lb/>
            Arnold, and his nephew Baldwin, and Earl William were <lb/>
            slain.2 Robert afterwards held the dukedom of Flanders <note type="footnote"> 1 Baldwin V. had only four children; Arnold was his grandson, son of <lb/>
            Baldwin VI., who succeeded his father, Baldwin V., September 1, 1067. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This battle was fought at Bavinchove, near Cassel, the 20th of Feb. </note> <pb n="60"/>

            for many years, and at his death left it to his sons Robert <lb/>
            of Jerusalem and Philip.1 The body of Earl William was <lb/>
            carried to Normandy by his men-at-arms, and interred amid <lb/>
            much sorrow in the abbey of Cormeilles. He had founded <lb/>
            two abbeys on his patrimonial estates in honour of St. Mary, <lb/>
            Mother of God; one at Lire, on the river Rille, where <lb/>
            Adeliza his wife was buried, and the other at Cormeilles <lb/>
            where, as I have just mentioned, he was himself interred.2 <lb/>
            This baron, the bravest of all the Normans, was deeply <lb/>
            lamented by all who knew his generosity, his good humour, <lb/>
            and general virtues. King William thus distributed his <lb/>
            inheritance among his sons. William the eldest son had <lb/>
            Breteuil, Pacy, and the rest of his patrimonial estates in <lb/>
            Normandy which he possessed during all his life, nearly <lb/>
            thirty years. Roger, the younger brother, had the earldom <lb/>
            of Hereford and his father's other possessions in England ; <lb/>
            but he shortly afterwards lost all by his perfidy and folly, <lb/>
            as will appear in the sequel.</p>
          <p>Though Matilda's government was powerful and her <lb/>
            resources vast, she was plunged into the deepest affliction <lb/>
            by the death of her father, her mother's bereavement, the <lb/>
            cruelty of one brother, which caused the loss of another, as <lb/>
            well as of her beloved nephew, and a number of her friends. <lb/>
            It is thus that the Almighty God punishes the inhabitants <lb/>
            of the earth when they forget him, casts down the proud, and <lb/>
            makes it plain that he is the Ruler of the universe. Robert <lb/>
            the Frisian now subjugated the whole of Flanders, and held <lb/>
            possession of it for almost thirty years,3 securing with ease <lb/>
            the alliance of Philip king of France. Those two princes <lb/>
            were cousins by descent, and both married daughters of <lb/>
            Florence, marquis of Frisia ;4 and their sons are to the <note type="footnote"> 1071. The person described by our author as nephew of Robert the Frisian, <lb/>
            was Baldwin, count d'HainauIt, Arnold's eldest brother, but he did not <lb/>
            fall in the battle, living till the first crusade, which he joined. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Robert the Frisian died suddenly in October, 1093, leaving, as our <lb/>

            present day united in the same bonds of amity. But a new <lb/>
            cause of dissension between the Normans and Flemings <lb/>
            sprung out of the death of the queen's brother and other <lb/>
            relations, and especially that of Earl William [Fitz-Osbern]. <lb/>
            Affairs in Normandy becoming thus disturbed, the king put <lb/>
            his English dominions into a good condition, and then <lb/>
            hastened over to Normandy that he might order things <lb/>
            there to the best advantage. The king's arrival being <lb/>
            known, the hearts of the peaceable were gladdened, but the <lb/>
            promoters of discord, and those stained with crimes, whose <lb/>
            consciences reproached them, trembled at the approach of <lb/>
            an avenging power. The king assembled the leading men <lb/>
            of Normandy and Maine, and in a royal speech recommended <lb/>
            them all to maintain peace and do justice. The bishops and <lb/>
            churchmen he exhorted to lead good lives, continually to <lb/>
            study God's law, to consult together for the welfare of the <lb/>
            church, to correct the morals of their flocks according to <lb/>
            the canonical decrees, and in all things to govern with <lb/>
            prudence.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1072 a synod assembled in the city <lb/>
            of Rouen, the metropolitan see, in the church of the blessed <lb/>
            St. Mary, ever virgin, mother of God. John, archbishop of <lb/>
            that see, presided, and following in the steps of the fathers, <lb/>
            consulted on various points regarding the necessities of the <lb/>
            church with his suffragans, Odo, bishop of Bayeux, Hugh of <lb/>
            Lisieux, Robert of Séez, Michael of Avranches, and Gisle­ <lb/>
            bert of Evreux.1 The doctrine of the church on the holy <lb/>
            and undivided Trinity was first taken into consideration, <lb/>
            which they affirmed, ratified, and made profession of their <lb/>
            belief with their whole hearts according to the decrees <lb/>
            of the sacred councils of Nice, Constantinople, the first of <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. CH.X. </note> <lb/>
            Catholic faith, the following articles were added as they are <lb/>
            hereunder written.</p>
          <p>First. It is ordered by us, that according to the decrees <lb/>
            of the fathers, the chrism, and the oil for baptism and the <lb/>
            holy unction, be consecrated at a convenient hour, that is, <lb/>
            after the second nones, as the aforesaid fathers decreed. The <lb/>
            bishop should take care that twelve priests, or as many as he <lb/>
            has with him, assist at the consecration in their sacerdotal <lb/>
            vestments.</p>
          <p>Item. In some dioceses an odious practice has grown up <lb/>
            for the archdeacons, in the absence of the bishop, to obtain <lb/>
            from some other bishop small portions of oil and chrism, <lb/>
            and to mix them with oil of their own; which custom is <lb/>
            condemned, and every archdeacon is to present the whole of <lb/>
            his chrism and oil to the consecrating bishop, the same as if <lb/>
            it was his own diocesan.</p>
          <p>Item. The distribution of the chrism and oil shall be made <lb/>
            by the deans with the greatest care and reverence, so that <lb/>
            they wear albs while the distribution takes place, and it be <lb/>
            so made in such vessels, that no portion be lost by care­ <lb/>
            lessness.</p>
          <p>Item. It is ordered, that no priest shall celebrate mass <lb/>
            without also communicating.</p>
          <p>Item. No priest shall baptize a child unless he wear his <lb/>
            alb and stole, but upon urgent necessity.</p>
          <p>Item. There are some priests who reserve the viaticum <lb/>
            and holy water beyond the eighth day, which is condemned. <lb/>
            Others, when they have no consecrated host, make a fresh <lb/>
            consecration, which is severely forbidden.</p>
          <p>Item. It is ordered, that the gifts of the Holy Spirit shall <lb/>
            not be conferred without both givers and receivers having <lb/>
            fasted, nor the confirmation be made without fire [candles ?]. <lb/>
            This is enjoined, that in conferring holy orders we may not <lb/>
            violate apostolical authority. For we read in the decrees of <lb/>
            Pope Leo, that holy orders shall not be given indiscrimi­ <lb/>
            nately every day, but after Saturday in the beginning of the <lb/>
            succeeding night, the holy benediction be given, both those <lb/>
            who give and those who receive it being then fasting. The <lb/>
            same rule will be observed when the office is performed on <lb/>
            the morning of the Lord's day, the fast having been pro- <pb n="63"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1072.] </note> <lb/>
            longed. This portion of time is a prolongation of the <lb/>
            commencement of the night preceding, and it is not to be <lb/>
            doubted that it belongs to the day of the resurrection as is <lb/>
            also declared in our Lord's passion.</p>
          <p>Item. The observance of the four seasons, according to <lb/>
            the divine institution, is to be kept among us with general <lb/>
            accord at the proper periods; viz., the first week in March, <lb/>
            the second in June, the third in September, and the same <lb/>
            in December, in honour of the nativity of our Lord. It <lb/>
            would be unseemly that an institution of the saints should <lb/>
            be nullified by worldly cares and occupations.</p>
          <p>Item. Clerks, who, without election, vocation, or the <lb/>
            ntervention of a bishop, intrude themselves into sacred <lb/>
            orders; those who have been ordained [priests] by the <lb/>
            bishop, supposing them to be already deacons; and those <lb/>
            ,vho are ordained priests and deacons, without having had <lb/>
            ;he minor orders; all these ought to be deposed.</p>
          <p>Item. Those who have received the tonsure, and afterwards <lb/>
            'elinquished it, shall be excommunicated until such time as <lb/>
            they make due amends. Clerks offering themselves for <lb/>
            )rdination are to present themselves at the bishop's residence <lb/>
            )n the fifth day [Thursday].</p>
          <p>Item. Monks and nuns, who, quitting their convents, <lb/>
            wander about from place to place, and those who have been <lb/>
            expelled for their offences, ought to be compelled by pastoral <lb/>
            authority to return to their convents. If the abbots shall <lb/>
            refuse to re-admit those who have been expelled, let them be <lb/>
            supplied with food as alms, or which they may earn by the <lb/>
            labour of their hands, until it be ascertained that they have <lb/>
            amended their lives.</p>
          <p>Item. Forasmuch as the cure of souls is trafficked in by <lb/>
            buying and selling, both by the clergy and laity, and even by <lb/>
            monks, such practices are strictly forbidden.</p>
          <p>Marriages are not to be solemnized in private, nor after <lb/>
            dinner; but the bride and bridegroom shall receive the <lb/>
            nuptial benediction fasting, from a priest who is also fasting, <lb/>
            at the manse.1 And, before they are united, their family <lb/>
            shall be inquired into; and if there be found to be any con- <note type="footnote"> 1 " In monasteries." The French editor of Ordericus remarks that the <lb/>
            term, in writers of the middle ages, often means the parish church. See <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.IV. CH.X. </note> <lb/>
            sanguinity within the seventh generation, or if either of the <lb/>
            parties has been divorced, they must not be married. Any <lb/>
            priest who breaks this rule shall be deposed.</p>
          <p>Concerning priests, deacons, and subdeacons, who have <lb/>
            taken women to live with them, the decree of the synod of <lb/>
            Lisieux shall be observed; that they are not to have the care <lb/>
            of churches, neither of themselves, or by their vicars, and <lb/>
            shall receive no part of the revenues. Archdeacons, who <lb/>
            eught to enforce discipline, may not be allowed to have con­ <lb/>
            cubines, or handmaids, or any women smuggled in; but <lb/>
            should set an example of continence and holiness to their <lb/>
            subordinates. Those should be chosen deans who know <lb/>
            how to reprove and correct the inferior clergy, whose life is <lb/>
            irreproachable, and who merit the preferment more than <lb/>
            others.1</p>
          <p>Item. It is forbidden any one who, in the lifetime of his <lb/>
            wife, has been charged with adultery, after her death to <lb/>
            marry the woman with respect to whom he was accused. <lb/>
            For great mischief has ensued from this practice; and men <lb/>
            have even murdered their wives.</p>
          <p>Item. No one whose wife has taken the veil, shall marry <lb/>
            again while she is living.</p>
          <p>Item. If the wife of any man who has gone in pilgrimage <lb/>
            or elsewhere, shall marry another before she has received <lb/>
            certain intelligence of his death, she shall be excom­ <lb/>
            municated until she has made due satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Item. It is decreed that those who fall publicly into mortal <lb/>
            sins shall not be very soon reinstated in holy orders. For, <lb/>
            as St. Gregory says, if the lapsed obtain license to return to <lb/>
            their order, the influence of canonical discipline is undoubt­ <lb/>
            edly weakened, as the hope of being restored diminishes the <lb/>
            fear of encouraging the inclination to evil conduct. It should, <note type="footnote"> 1 This canon caused a tumult, in which the archbishop barely escaped <lb/>
            with his life. The controversy about married priests caused great dis­ <lb/>
            turbances throughout Europe. A similar decree was made by a synod <lb/>
            held at London in 1102. See Huntingdon's History, p. 241, 252. <lb/>
            No distinction was drawn between wives and concubines ; indeed the <lb/>
            words of this canon seem studiously to ignore the legal existence of the <lb/>
            former—" qui feminas usurpaverint." The term uxores is used by the <lb/>
            synod of London, but that is understood to apply both to wives and con­ <lb/>
            cubines. The synod of Lisieux here mentioned was held in 1055. It <lb/>
            deposed Archbishop Mauger. Its acts are lost. </note> <pb n="65"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1072.] </note> <lb/>
            therefore, be an established rule, that those who fall into <lb/>
            open sin, should on no account be restored to their former <lb/>
            rank, but under special circumstances, and after making <lb/>
            amends by a long penance.</p>
          <p>Item. If any clerk who has lapsed, is liable to be deposed, <lb/>
            and a sufficient number of bishops, according to the canons, <lb/>
            cannot be assembled for that purpose, viz. six, in the case of <lb/>
            priests, and three, in that of deacons, any bishop who <lb/>
            cannot attend may substitute his vicar-general with equal <lb/>
            authority.</p>
          <p>Item. It is decreed, that during Lent, no one shall dine <lb/>
            till the hour of nones is passed, and vespers begin. No one <lb/>
            who eats before shall be considered as fasting.</p>
          <p>Item. It is decreed, that, on the Saturday of Easter, the <lb/>
            office shall not commence before nones. For it has regard <lb/>
            to the night of our Lord's resurrection, in honour of which <lb/>
            the Gloria in Excelsis and Alleluia is sung. It is also <lb/>
            marked by the benediction of the candle at the beginning of <lb/>
            the office. The book of Offices1 says that, on these two <lb/>
            days, the eucharist is not celebrated. By the two days are <lb/>
            meant the sixth day [Friday] and Saturday, on which the <lb/>
            grief and mourning of the apostles are commemorated.</p>
          <p>Item. If the feast of any saint occurs on a day on which <lb/>
            it cannot be kept, it shall be celebrated not before but <lb/>
            within the octave.</p>
          <p>Item. According to the decrees of the holy fathers, Popes <lb/>
            Innocent and Leo, we order that general baptism shall only <lb/>
            be administered on the Saturday of Easter and Whitsuntide ; <lb/>
            with this provision, that the washing of regeneration shall <lb/>
            not be denied to infants, at whatever time, or on whatever <lb/>
            day it is required. However, we entirely forbid the adminis­ <lb/>
            tration of baptism on the eve or the feast of the Epiphany, <lb/>
            unless in case of sickness.</p>
          <p>The decrees of this synod were subscribed by John, arch­ <lb/>
            bishop of Rouen, Odo, bishop of Bayeux, Michael, bishop of <lb/>
            Avranches, Gislebert, bishop of Evreux, and some venerable <lb/>
            abbots, who were at that time the honour of the monasteries <lb/>

          <p>I THINK it well to transmit to posterity an account of the <lb/>
            holy fathers who wisely governed the abbeys of Normandy, <lb/>
            in the time of King William, and whose study it was worthily <lb/>
            to serve the eternal King, who reigns unchangeably. Their <lb/>
            disciples, I think, have already committed to writing many <lb/>
            of their memoirs for the information of future times, but <lb/>
            there are some whom it is pleasant to me, as well as to my <lb/>
            superiors, at least to name in these pages, for the particular <lb/>
            regard I bear them, and not for any worldly advantage, but <lb/>
            simply from my love of learning, and the piety with which <lb/>
            they were divinely inspired.</p>
          <p>The abbey of Fécamp, which stands in sight of the sea, <lb/>
            and is dedicated to the holy and undivided Trinity, Creator <lb/>
            of all things, was nobly founded by Richard I., duke of <lb/>
            Normandy, and afterwards richly endowed with lands and <lb/>
            possessions by Richard II. After William of Dijon, a man <lb/>
            of great wisdom and zealous for religion, the venerable abbot <lb/>
            John governed this monastery fifty-one years. Next, it was <lb/>
            held for almost twenty-seven years by William de Ros, a <lb/>
            clerk of Bayeux and monk of Caen.1' Like the mystical <lb/>
            spikenard, he was an odour of sweet smelling in the house <lb/>
            of the Lord by his charity, munificence, and many virtues. <lb/>
            The works he diligently performed either before the world, <lb/>
            or in secret before few witnesses, bore witness to the spirit <lb/>
            which dwelt within him, and entirely possessing him, con­ <lb/>
            ducted him to his crown before the throne of the Lord of <lb/>
            Sabaoth.</p>
          <p>The monk Gontard was removed from the abbey of <lb/>
            Fontenelles2 by the election of prudent men, and appointed <lb/>
            ruler of the abbey of Jumièges, after the death of Abbot <lb/>
            Robert. He diligently spread the food of spiritual wisdom <lb/>
            before the flock committed to his charge, and sustained with <lb/>
            vigour the strictness of monastic discipline. He cherished <note type="footnote"> 1 William de Dijon, 1001—1028 ; John, a native of the neighbourhood <lb/>

            and honoured the gentle and submissive, as a father treats <lb/>
            his children, but applied the rod of correction to the repro­ <lb/>
            bate and contumacious and despisers of discipline, like a <lb/>
            severe master. At length, having accompanied his col­ <lb/>
            leagues, the bishops of Normandy, to the council of Cler­ <lb/>
            mont held by Pope Urban, A.D. 1095, the third indiction, <lb/>

          <p>On the death of Herluin, who was the founder and first <lb/>
            abbot of the monastery of Bec,2 and being endowed with <lb/>
            spiritual graces in his lifetime, contributed much to the <lb/>
            profit of the children of the church, he was succeeded by <lb/>
            the venerable Anselm, a man of deep erudition, who, by <lb/>
            God's grace, filled the abbey much to its renown, with <lb/>
            devout and learned brethren. As the number of the <lb/>
            servants of God increased, their means of subsistence did <lb/>
            not fail, but there was abundant provision for the honour­ <lb/>
            able entertainment of the noble friends and attached <lb/>
            brothers who flocked to the abbey from all quarters. <lb/>
            Learned men of eminence, both clergy and laity, resorted to <lb/>
            hear the sweet words of truth which flowed from his mouth, <lb/>
            pleasing to the seekers of righteousness as angels' dis­ <lb/>
            courses. Anselm, who was a native of Italy, had followed <lb/>
            Lanfranc to Bee, and as the Israelites carried off the gold <lb/>
            and wealth of the Egyptians, so he entered with joy the <lb/>
            land of promise with a full lading of the worldly erudition <lb/>
            of the philosophers. Becoming a monk, he gave himself up <lb/>
            to the study of theology, and poured forth abundantly the <lb/>
            honeyed streams of wisdom from the rich fountain of <lb/>
            wisdom. He skilfully cleared up the difficulties of the <lb/>
            obscure passages of scripture, threw light upon them by his <lb/>
            discourses and writings, and expounded with soundness the <lb/>
            mysterious predictions of the prophets. All his words were <lb/>
            valuable, and edified his attached hearers. His attentive <lb/>
            pupils committed to writing his letters and typical dis­ <lb/>
            courses ; so that, being deeply imbued with them, they <note type="footnote"> 1 Gontard, abbot of Jumièges, about 1078—November 26, 1095, the <lb/>

            His successors, William and Boso, were deeply penetrated <lb/>
            with this spirit, and having drawn deeply at the source of <lb/>
            so much wisdom, were able to distribute large draughts of <lb/>
            the pure stream to their thirsting disciples. Anselm was <lb/>
            courteous and affable, replying with kindness to all who <lb/>
            questioned him in simplicity. At the instance of his friends <lb/>
            he published books, keenly and profoundly written, on the <lb/>
            Trinity, on Truth, Freewill, the Fall of Satan, and the <lb/>
            question, Why God was made Man ? His disciples spread <lb/>
            the report of his talents through all the Latin world, and <lb/>
            the western church was filled to inebriation with the nectar <lb/>
            of his exalted character. The vast deposit of learning and <lb/>
            theology at the abbey of Bee, begun by Lanfranc, was nobly <lb/>
            added to by Anselm,l and thence proceeded a succession of <lb/>
            enlightened teachers, careful pilots and spiritual cha­ <lb/>
            rioteers,2 to whom were confided the helm and the reins by <lb/>
            which the church is divinely guided in the concerns of the <lb/>
            present world. The monks of Bee are thus become so <lb/>
            devoted to literary pursuits, and so exercised in raising and <lb/>
            solving difficult questions of divinity, and in profitable dis­ <lb/>
            cussions, that they seem to be almost all philosophers; and <lb/>
            those among them who appear to be illiterate, and might be <lb/>
            called clowns, derive from their intercourse with the rest <lb/>
            the advantages of becoming fluent grammarians. Delight­ <lb/>
            ing in God's worship with mutual good-will and sweet <lb/>
            affection, and taught by true wisdom, they are unwearied in <lb/>
            the offices of devotion. The hospitality of the monks at <lb/>
            Bee I cannot sufficiently praise. Ask the Burgundians and <lb/>
            Spaniards, and their other visitors from far and near, and <lb/>
            their replies will tell truly with what kindness they are <lb/>
            entertained; and they will doubtless strive to imitate it <lb/>
            under similar circumstances. The gate of the abbey of Bee <lb/>
            stands for ever open to every traveller, and their bread is <lb/>
            never refused to any one who asks it for charity's sake <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Anselm, abbot of Bee, 1079—March 6, 1093, was a native o) <lb/>

            <title type="sub">Cn. XII. Popes Alexander II. and Gregory VII. (Hilde­ brand)—Singular nomination of Hoel to the see of Mans.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1073 (the eleventh indiction), Pope <lb/>
            Alexander II. departed this life, after filling the Roman and <lb/>
            apostolical see eleven years ; and Gregory VII., whose baptis­ <lb/>
            mal name was Hildebrand, succeeding him, sat in the chair of <lb/>
            St. Peter seventeen years.2 A monk from his childhood, <lb/>
            Gregory was deeply read in the Jaw of God, and his fervent <lb/>
            zeal in the path of justice brought on him much persecution. <lb/>
            He launched his apostolical decrees through all the world, <lb/>
            and, sparing no one, thundered forth the holy oracles with <lb/>
            terrible effect, summoned all men to the marriage feast of <lb/>
            the Lord of Sabaoth with both prayers and threats. At the <lb/>
            request of this pope, the venerable Hugh, abbot of Cluni, <lb/>
            sent to Rome Odo, prior of that monastery, who had been a <lb/>
            canon of Rheims, accompanied by other chosen monks, who <lb/>
            were joyfully received by the pope as fellow labourers sent <lb/>
            him by God.3 He selected Odo for his principal counsellor, <lb/>
            and made him bishop of Ostia, which see has the prerogative <lb/>
            of having its bishop elected by the clergy of Rome, and <lb/>
            consecrated by the pope himself. Benedict also promoted <lb/>
            the other monks, as circumstances permitted, preferring <lb/>
            them to the government of different churches.</p>
          <p>On the death of Arnold, bishop of Mans, King William <lb/>
            said to Samson, bishop of Bayeux, his chaplain: " The <note type="footnote"> 1 Nicholas, son of Richard, abbot of St. Ouen, 1056—February, 1092. <lb/>
            The end of the north transept of the church here mentioned is still <lb/>
            standing. This striking ruin, which stands between the present church and <lb/>
            the hotel of the municipality, examined from the interior, Tully justifies, by <lb/>
            its fine proportions, the admiration with which our author viewed it. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pope Alexander II., September 30, 1061—April 21, 1073; Gregory <lb/>

            bishopric of Mans being now void, I wish, by God's will, to <lb/>
            promote you to that see in his place. Mans, an ancient city <lb/>
            which derives its name from canine madness,1 has a popula­ <lb/>
            tion which is always aggressive and blood-thirsty as regards <lb/>
            its neighbours, and insolent and rebellious to its lords. I <lb/>
            have, therefore, resolved to place the reins of its ecclesias­ <lb/>
            tical government in your hands, having cherished and <lb/>
            dearly loved you from your childhood, and desiring now to <lb/>
            place you high among the great men of my dominions." <lb/>
            Samson replied: " According to the apostolical precept, a <lb/>
            bishop ought to be irreproachable; but I huve been far from <lb/>
            answering to that character, during the whole course of my <lb/>
            life, for I feel that before God I am polluted with sins, both <lb/>
            of body and mind; and, wretched and unworthy as I am, <lb/>
            my manifold offences forbid me to aspire to so high a <lb/>
            dignity." The king said: " With your natural shrewdness <lb/>
            you see clearly that you act rightly in confessing yourself a <lb/>
            sinner; but I have set my mind on you, and shall not <lb/>
            depart from my purpose, unless you either accept the <lb/>
            bishopric, or recommend me another to take it in your <lb/>
            place." Simon heard this with joy, and replied: "My lord <lb/>
            and king, you have now spoken well; and you will find me <lb/>
            ready, with God's help, to do what you wish. You have in <lb/>
            your chapel a poor clerk, who is well born and of good <lb/>
            conversation. Give him the bishopric, in the fear of the <lb/>
            Lord, for I think he is worthy of that honour. On the <lb/>
            king's inquiring who he meant, Simon replied : " His name <lb/>
            is Hoel, and he is a native of Brittany, and a humble and <lb/>
            truly good man." Noel was presently summoned at the <lb/>
            king's command, without being informed for what purpose. <lb/>
            But when the king saw before him a mere youth, in mean <lb/>
            apparel, and of emaciated aspect, he conceived a contempt for <lb/>
            him, and, turning to Simon, said: " Is this the person you <lb/>
            praised so highly ? " To which Samson replied: " Even so, <lb/>
            my lord; I honestly recommend him without the slightest <lb/>
            hesitation, and it is not without reason that I prefer him to <lb/>
            myself and such as me. His gentleness and benevolence <lb/>
            make him fit to be a bishop. Do not despise him for his <lb/>
            emaciated appearance. His humble dress only makes him <note type="footnote"> 1 A play upon the Latin term for Mans; cæno-manis a canind rabie <lb/>
            dicta. </note> <pb n="72"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IV. CH.XII."/> <lb/>
            more estimable in the eyes of wise men; God himself does <lb/>
            not regard a man's exterior, but has respect unto the worth <lb/>
            concealed beneath it." The king, in his wisdom, reflected <lb/>
            on observations so full of sagacity, and, coming to a better <lb/>
            mind, and bringing his scattered thoughts under the control <lb/>
            of reason, hastened again to call the clerk we are speaking <lb/>
            of to his presence, and committed to him the charge and <lb/>
            temporalities of the bishopric of Mans. The royal will <lb/>
            being made known among the clergy, testimonies of Hoel's <lb/>
            good conversation were universally forthcoming. The faithful <lb/>
            offered their devout praises to God for so just and excellent <lb/>
            a selection, and the pastor-elect was introduced with fitting <lb/>
            honour to the sheepfold of his flock by the bishops and <lb/>
            other servants of God who received the king's commands. <lb/>
            The new bishop was not more astonished at his sudden pro­ <lb/>
            motion than David, when he was scorned by his brethren, at <lb/>
            Samuel's raising him to the throne of Judah. Hoel, bishop <lb/>
            of Mans, thus elevated to the government of that see, <lb/>
            presided over it in great sanctity for fifteen years. He laid <lb/>
            the foundations of the cathedral church in which the <lb/>
            remains of St. Julian the confessor, and first bishop of Mans, <lb/>
            were deposited; and began other works, which the church <lb/>
            required, labouring to complete them as opportunity offered.1 <lb/>
            At his death, he was succeeded by Hildebert, a distinguished <lb/>
            versifier, who worthily filled the see for thirty years. He <lb/>
            completed the cathedral church begun by his predecessor, <lb/>
            which he solemnly consecrated amid the great rejoicings <lb/>
            of the people. Not long afterwards, in the year of our <lb/>
            Lord 1125, the fourth indiction, when Gislebert, arch­ <lb/>
            bishop of Tours, died at Rome, at the same time as Pope <lb/>
            Callistus II., he was called to the metroplitan see of Tours <lb/>
            in the time of Pope Honorius, by the demands and orders <lb/>
            of the holy church, and still continues to hold it with laud­ <lb/>
            able care and exemplary conduct. <note type="footnote"> I The appointment of Hoel to the see of Mans was not made in 1073, <lb/>
            but after the death of Arnold, his immediate predecessor, the 24th of <lb/>
            July, 1097. The historians of Mans repudiate the extraordinary circum­ <lb/>
            stances related by our author on the subject of his election. According to <lb/>
            them, Hoel completed the cathedral begun by Vulgrin and Arnold, and <lb/>
            Hildebert only erected the chapter-house and sacristy. But as the con­ <lb/>
            secration of the cathedral was not made till 1120, it is hardly probable <lb/>
            that it would have been deferred so long, if it had been finished by Hoel. </note> <pb n="73"/>

            the highest rank, but a vast number of the powerful nobles, who under <lb/>
            various titles carved out for themselves independent sovereignty in frag­ <lb/>

            the ninth and succeeding centuries. Herbert Eveille-chien succeeded his <lb/>

          <p>Hugh, the son of Herbert, after Alan count of Brittany, <lb/>
            died in Normandy from poison given him by the Normans, <lb/>
            married his widow Bertha, daughter of Theobald count de <lb/>
            Blots, by whom lie had a son named Herbert and three <lb/>
            daughters;1 one of them was given in marriage to Azzo, <lb/>
            marquis of Liguria; another, named Margaret, was be. <lb/>
            trothed to Robert, son of William duke of Normandy, but <lb/>
            died while she was his ward, before marriage. The third <lb/>
            married John, lord of the castle called Flèche, by whom she <lb/>
            had three sons, Goisbert, Elias, and Enoch.2</p>
          <p>Geoffrey Martel, the brave count of Anjou, dying, was <lb/>
            succeeded by his two nephews, sons of his sister by Alberie, <lb/>
            count du Gâtinois, one of whom, Geoffrey, a prince of <lb/>
            simple and gentle manners, obtained the county in right of <lb/>
            his being the eldest. After the death of the younger <lb/>
            brother Herbert, William duke of Normandy acquired his <lb/>
            share of the inheritance, and Count Geoffrey conferred the <lb/>
            fief on Robert, with his daughter's hand in marriage, <lb/>
            receiving from him homage and fealty in the presence of his <lb/>
            father at Alençon. Not long afterwards Fulk, surnamed <lb/>
            Réchin, revolted from Geoffrey his brother and liege lord, <lb/>
            and treacherously siezing him kept him prisoner in the <lb/>
            castle of Chinon more than thirty years. Such were the <lb/>
            revolutions which disturbed the province of Anjou and its <lb/>
            neighbours, and in which the nobles of the country took <lb/>
            different sides, according to their inclinations.</p>
          <p>While Fulk himself was deeply grieved at seeing Maine <lb/>
            under the supremacy of the Normans, the turbulent citi­ <lb/>
            zens and neighbouring garrisons, with some hired soldiers, <lb/>
            joined unanimously in a conspiracy against their foreign <lb/>

            fortifications of the city, defeated and expelled Turgis de <lb/>
            Traci1 and William de la Ferté, and the rest of the king's <lb/>
            officers. Some were slain, making a brave resistance, others <lb/>
            were cruelly thrown into prison, and, ample revenge was <lb/>
            taken on the Normans thus deprived of their liberty. All <lb/>
            the country was now in a state of disturbance, the Norman <lb/>
            power was eclipsed, and assailed by almost all, as by an <lb/>
            universal blight. In like manner Geoffrey de Mayenne and <lb/>
            other barons of Maine, formed a conspiracy and rose against <lb/>
            the Normans ; a few only, for their own reasons and under <lb/>
            various circumstances, maintained their allegiance to King <lb/>
            William.</p>
          <p>When this great king heard the dreadful reports of the <lb/>
            massacre of his officers, his anger was roused, and he took <lb/>
            measures for checking the progress of his enemies, and <lb/>
            revenging, by arms, the rebellion of the traitors as it de­ <lb/>
            served. The Normans and English were quickly summoned <lb/>
            to the field, and the several bodies of troops being formed <lb/>
            into one army, with horse and foot skilfully arrayed under <lb/>
            their several commanders, he marched at the head of this <lb/>
            formidable force into the country of Maine. He first be­ <lb/>
            sieged the castle of Fresnai, where he knighted Robert de <lb/>
            Belesme. Hubert, the governor, however, came to terms, <lb/>
            and, surrendering his castles of Fresnai and Beaumont2 to <lb/>
            the king, continued his submission for some time. Having <lb/>
            next laid siege to the castle of Sillé, the governor gave him­ <lb/>
            self up to the king and obtained peace. No one indeed was <lb/>
            able to make any resistance to the overwhelming force of <lb/>
            the royal army, but all the garrisons of the castles and the <lb/>
            country people, with the clerks and monks, decided on <lb/>
            receiving the king as the restorer of peace, with fitting <lb/>
            honours. At length he came before Maine, and investing <lb/>
            the place with several divisions of his army, made his royal <lb/>
            commands duly known, imperiously requiring the citizens <lb/>
            to consult their own safety by quietly surrendering the <lb/>
            place, and so avoiding an assault and the consequent horrors <lb/>
            of fire and sword. Listening to this wise counsel, the citi­ <lb/>
            zens came the next day, bringing with them the keys of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Turgis de Trad, near Vire, where there are still the ruins of a <lb/>

            city, and offering their submission, which the king received <lb/>
            with favour. The rest of the people of Maine were terrified <lb/>
            at seeing so vast and fierce an army marching through their <lb/>
            territories, and they found that their fellow conspirators <lb/>
            and supporters were unable to make any stand against so <lb/>
            experienced a general. They therefore sent delegates to <lb/>
            the conqueror to ask for peace, and terms being made, they <lb/>
            gladly joined their standards with the royal ensigns, and <lb/>
            were permitted thenceforth to live in peace in their own <lb/>
            homes and under their vines, and enjoy themselves as they <lb/>
            pleased.</p>
          <p>Order being thus restored in Maine without much fight­ <lb/>
            ing, and the province continuing tranquil under the do­ <lb/>
            minion of King William, Count Fulk' became mischievously <lb/>
            jealous, and his anger broke forth against some of the ad. <lb/>
            herents of the Normans. John de la Fleche, the most <lb/>
            powerful lord in Anjou, who was particularly obnoxious to <lb/>
            him on this account, having ascertained that the count was <lb/>
            ready to fall upon him with an armed force, summoned his <lb/>
            confederates in the neighbourhood to his assistance, and <lb/>
            demanded the support of King William, which was granted <lb/>
            him. For, without delay, the king sent to him William de <lb/>
            Moulins, Robert de Vieux-Pont, and other brave and ex­ <lb/>
            perienced knights, who were at once united by John with <lb/>
            his own followers in the defence of his towns. Fulk, <lb/>
            learning these dispositions, was much vexed, and immediately <lb/>
            collecting a body of troops laid siege to John's Castle. <lb/>
            Count Hoel2 also came to the succour of Fulk with a large <lb/>
            force of Bretons, with which he did all in his power to <lb/>
            second the enterprise of Fulk. King William, knowing <lb/>
            that such large bodies of troops must completely surround <lb/>
            his own adherents, again issued a royal proclamation for <lb/>
            mustering the Normans and English and other people <lb/>
            under his rule, and like a resolute general led an army of <lb/>
            60,000 men, as report says, against the enemy. Meanwhile <lb/>
            the Angevins and the Bretons, on hearing of the approach <lb/>
            of the royal army, did not retire, but boldly crossed the <lb/>
            Loire, and after effecting the passage destroyed their boats, <lb/>

            perate in fighting. While, however, the two armies were <lb/>
            in face of each other, drawn out for battle, and many hearts <lb/>
            quailed at the fearful death, and the still more fearful fate <lb/>
            after death, which awaits the reprobate, a cardinal priest of <lb/>
            the Roman church, and some pious monks, interfered by <lb/>
            divine inspiration, and remonstrated with the chiefs of both <lb/>
            armies. They firmly forbade the battle in God's name, and <lb/>
            used exhortations and prayers to effect a peace. Their <lb/>
            endeavours were powerfully seconded by William of Evreux <lb/>
            and Roger [de Montgomery],1 and other counts and brave <lb/>
            soldiers, who, bold and forward as they were in legitimate <lb/>
            contests, were slack to engage in odious quarrels, brought <lb/>
            about by pride and injustice. The messengers of Christ <lb/>
            thus sowing the seeds of concord, the arrogance of the am­ <lb/>
            bitious gave way, and the fears of the timid were gradually <lb/>
            allayed. Many conferences were held, a variety of proposals <lb/>
            were discussed, there was a contest of words; but by the <lb/>
            power of God the ambassadors of peace were successful <lb/>
            with both parties. The count of Anjou ceded his rights in <lb/>
            Maine to the young prince Robert, the king's son, with all <lb/>
            the fiefs which the prince acquired by Margaret his wife <lb/>
            from Count Herbert. Finally, Robert performed due <lb/>
            homage to Fulk, as a vassal to his superior lord. John <lb/>
            and the other Angevins, who had borne arms for the king <lb/>
            against the count, were reconciled to their sovereign, while, <lb/>
            on the other hand, those of Maine, who had revolted with <lb/>
            the count against the king, were included in the treaty. <lb/>
            The grace of God thus reconciling the hearts of the princes, <lb/>
            offences were repented and forgotten on one side and the <lb/>
            other, and the good people made great rejoicings at the <lb/>
            peace which delivered them from the lowering storms that <lb/>
            disturbed their tranquillity. The peace between the king <lb/>
            and the count, which was concluded at a place commonly <lb/>
            called Blanch-Land or Blanche-Bruyerre,2 lasted all the <lb/>

          <p>AT the same period [A.D. 1074] there arose another violent <lb/>
            storm fraught with trouble and disaster to vast numbers in <lb/>
            England. Two powerful English noblemen, Roger, earl of <lb/>
            Hereford, and his brother-in-law, Ralph, earl of Norwich,1 <lb/>
            concerted together an open revolt, being resolved to wrest <lb/>
            the dominion of England. from King William, and to set up <lb/>
            themselves as its sovereigns, or rather its tyrants. They <lb/>
            therefore, rivalled each other in fortifying their castles, <lb/>
            preparing arms, and mustering soldiers, sending frequent <lb/>
            messengers far and near to their trusty adherents, and <lb/>
            inviting, by entreaties and promises, all over whom they had <lb/>
            any influence to aid their enterprise. Having reflected on the <lb/>
            revolutions of affairs and the chances of the times, they said <lb/>
            to their confederates and allies:2 " All prudent men know <lb/>
            that a favourable moment must not be neglected, and that <lb/>
            when the right time is come, then it is that brave men <lb/>
            ought boldly to engage in a work of glory. But there never <lb/>
            was a more fitting opportunity than that which is now <lb/>
            afforded us by the mysterious dispensations of Providence <lb/>
            for aspiring to the throne. He who now bears the title of <lb/>

            Count de Pontoise, nephew of King Edward, and Biota his <lb/>
            wife, being his guests at Falaise, were both his victims by <lb/>
            poison in one and the same night.2 Conan, also, was taken <lb/>

            driving them into cruel banishment. He has not even <lb/>

            ampton, and tempted him to join them by a variety of sug­ <lb/>
            gestions, to this effect: " Brave sir, you may plainly see that <lb/>
            now is your time for recovering your forfeited honours, and <lb/>
            for securing vengeance for the unmerited injuries you have <lb/>
            lately suffered. Join our party, and support it without <lb/>
            faltering in your resolution, and the third part of England <lb/>
            shall be yours, by an equal division among ourselves. It is <lb/>
            our object that the realm of England should be restored to <lb/>
            the same state in which it lately was in the time of Edward <lb/>
            our most pious sovereign. Let one of us be king, the other <lb/>
            two dukes, and thus all the honours of England will be <lb/>
            divided among us. William is now engaged beyond the <lb/>
            sea in endless wars which absorb his whole strength, and we <lb/>
            know for certain that he will never land again on the shores <lb/>
            of England. Come, then, noble sir, listen to counsels so <lb/>
            advantageous to you and your family, and act in the manner <lb/>
            which will prove the salvation of our enslaved fellow <lb/>
            countrymen."</p>
          <p>Waltheof replied as follows: " In such enterprises the <lb/>
            utmost caution is required; and in all nations the fealty <lb/>
            sworn by every subject to his liege lord should be faithfully <lb/>
            kept. King William has received mine, lawfully given as <lb/>
            to his superior lord by one holding under him, and to secure <lb/>
            ray fidelity he gave me his niece in marriage. He also gave <lb/>
            me a rich earldom, and admitted me into the number of <lb/>
            his familiar companions. How can I be faithless to such <lb/>
            a prince without entirely breaking my fealty to him ? I am <pb n="81"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1074.] </note> <lb/>
            well known in many countries, and far from me be the <lb/>
            disgrace which would attend my being proclaimed a sacri­ <lb/>
            legious traitor. Never was there a song so sweet as to <lb/>
            charm away the disgrace of treason. All nations curse <lb/>
            traitors and turncoats, as they do wolves, thinking them <lb/>
            only fit to be hanged, and if they can catch them, condemn <lb/>
            them to the gibbet, with all the insults and tortures they <lb/>
            can devise. Ahitophel and Judas, both traitors and apos­ <lb/>
            tates, and each of them doomed to the gallows, to be <lb/>
            suspended between heaven and earth as fit for neither, <lb/>
            perished by their own hands. The law of England sen­ <lb/>
            tences a traitor to lose his head, and on his attainder <lb/>
            the inheritance of his children is escheated. God forbid <lb/>
            that such a crime should taint my honour, and my name be <lb/>
            held up to scorn with such infamy throughout the world! <lb/>
            The Lord God, who showed his power in saving David from <lb/>
            the hands of Goliah and Saul, Adarezer and Absalom, bath <lb/>
            delivered me also from many dangers both by sea and land. <lb/>
            I commit myself entirely to his keeping, trusting in him <lb/>
            that my life will never be stained with treason, and that I <lb/>
            shall not be branded with apostacy like Satan and the fallen <lb/>
            angels."</p>
          <p>When Ralph the Breton and Roger heard the determi­ <lb/>
            nation of Waltheof, they were sorely troubled, and bound <lb/>
            him by a terrible oath not to divulge their conspiracy. Not <lb/>
            long afterwards it'suddenly 'burst forth into open rebellion <lb/>
            in all parts of England, and the opposition to the king's <lb/>
            officers became general. Upon this, William de Warrene, <lb/>
            and Richard de Bienfaite, son of Earl Gislebert, who had <lb/>
            been appointed chief justiciaries of England, summoned the <lb/>
            rebels to appear in the king's high court. They, however, <lb/>
            disdained to pay any attention to the precept, and, following <lb/>
            up this contempt of court, set the royal authority at de­ <lb/>
            fiance. William and Richard, therefore, without further <lb/>
            delay, assembled the English army, and fought a severe <lb/>
            battle with the rebels on the plain called Fagadun.1 By God's <lb/>
            help they defeated the enemy, and taking them prisoners, <lb/>
            marked every one, without regard to his rank, by ampu­ <lb/>
            tating his right foot. Ralph the Breton was pursued to his <lb/>
            own castle without being taken. They then concentrated <note type="footnote"> 1 Beecham or Beechamwell, near Swaffham, Norfolk (?) </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <pb n="82"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IV. CH.XIV. </note> <lb/>
            their forces and invested Norwich, and adding to their <lb/>
            strength by their display of valour and military skill, they <lb/>
            harassed the besieged with constant assaults and their <lb/>
            engines of war, pressing the siege for three months with <lb/>
            unwearied vigour. The besieging army was continually aug­ <lb/>
            menting, and was abundantly supplied with abundance of <lb/>
            food and other necessaries to prevent desertion. Ralph de <lb/>
            Guader, finding himself thus shut up and expecting no <lb/>
            relief from his accomplices, entrusted the fortress, with <lb/>
            many cautions, to the trusty garrison, and embarked at the <lb/>
            nearest sea-port to seek for help in Denmark. Meanwhile, <lb/>
            the king's lieutenants, William and Robert, pressed the <lb/>
            townsmen to surrender, while they despatched hasty messen­ <lb/>
            gers over the sea to the king, giving an account of these <lb/>
            transactions and begging him to return with all speed for <lb/>
            the defence of the kingdom.</p>
          <p>No sooner had the indefatigable king received these <lb/>
            tidings than he set in order the affairs of Normandy and <lb/>
            Maine, and all being arranged, crossed over to England <lb/>
            without loss of time. He then summoned all the great men <lb/>
            of the realm to attend his court, and having addressed in <lb/>
            flattering terms the lords who had been faithful to their <lb/>
            allegiance and proved their fidelity, he demanded of the <lb/>
            authors and supporters of the rebellion the reason why they <lb/>
            preferred wrong to right. The garrison of Norwich having <lb/>
            made terms, the place was given up to the king, and Ralph <lb/>
            de Guader, earl of Norwich, was disinherited'of his English <lb/>
            honours and domains. Being banished the kingdom, he <lb/>
            returned to Brittany with his wife and settled on his patri­ <lb/>
            monial estates which his attainder by the sovereign of <lb/>
            England could not affect. In that province he had on his <lb/>
            domains two noble castles, Guader and Montfort, which his <lb/>
            sons possess by hereditary right to the present day. He <lb/>
            himself, some years afterwards, took the cross, and accom­ <lb/>
            panying Robert II., duke of Normandy, in his crusade against <lb/>
            the Turks, and reaching Jerusalem, died, as well as his wife, <lb/>
            a penitent and a pilgrim.</p>
          <p>Roger de Breteuil, earl of Hereford, having obeyed the <lb/>
            summons to attend the king's court, and an inquiry being <lb/>
            made, his treason was so plain that he could not deny it. <lb/>
            He was therefore judged by the Norman laws and sentenced <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1074.] </note> <lb/>
            to the forfeiture of his lands and perpetual imprisonment. <lb/>
            Even there he often caused the king great annoyance, and <lb/>
            rendered him implacable by his obstinate contumacy. For <lb/>
            instance, on one occasion when the faithful were celebrating <lb/>
            the feast of Easter in due form, and the king had sent to <lb/>
            Earl Roger in prison, by the hands of his guards, a box con­ <lb/>
            taining a suit of very valuable robes, the earl caused a large <lb/>
            fire to be made and committed to the flames the royal <lb/>
            presents, the surcoat, and silken tunic, and mantle of <lb/>
            the furs of precious ermines brought from abroad. The <lb/>
            king, hearing of this, exclaimed in great wrath: He <lb/>
            is very insolent to put such an affront upon me; but, <lb/>
            by God's light,1 he shall never get out of prison while I <lb/>
            live." And the royal will was so determined, and so firmly <lb/>
            carried out, that even after the king's death the earl was <lb/>
            detained in captivity until his own death released him from <lb/>
            it. His two sons, Reynold and Roger, young men of great <lb/>
            promise, are now in the service of King Henry,2 and in great <lb/>
            distress, are waiting for the exercise of his clemency, which <lb/>
            appears to them sufficiently tardy.</p>
          <p>Truly the world's glory droops and withers like the <lb/>
            flower of grass, and is spent and scattered like smoke. <lb/>
            Where now is William Fitz-Osbern, earl of Hereford, the <lb/>
            king's lieutenant, high-steward of Normandy, and the valiant <lb/>
            commander of the royal troops? He was, without excep­ <lb/>
            tion, the first and greatest of the oppressors of the people <lb/>
            of England, and amassed an enormous fortune by his exac­ <lb/>
            tions, causing the ruin and death of thousands by his severi­ <lb/>
            ties. But the righteous Judge, who seeth all things, rewards <lb/>
            every man according to his deserts. Miserable fate! Earl <lb/>
            William falls, and the bold warrior receives the punishment <lb/>
            he deserves. Many had fallen by his sword, and by the <lb/>
            sword he himself was suddenly cut off. After his death, <lb/>
            before five years elapsed, the spirit of discord stirred up his son <lb/>
            and son-in-law to hostilities against their lord and kinsman, <lb/>
            the same spirit which wrought in the Schechemites against <lb/>
            Abimelech whom they had set over them after slaying the <lb/>
            seventy sons of Jerobaal. I have thus correctly described <note type="footnote"> 1 An oath frequently used by William the Conqueror. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This paragraph, therefore, was written in the reign of Henry I. of <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CH. XV. Trial and execution of Earl Waltheof for alleged complicity in the rebellion.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>EARL WALTHEOF was summoned before the king, and <lb/>
            accused, on the testimony of his wife Judith, of having been <lb/>
            privy to and encouraged the conspiracy already spoken of, <lb/>
            and thus become guilty of treason against his sovereign. <lb/>
            The earl fearlessly acknowledged that the conspirators had <lb/>
            communicated to him their nefarious designs, but declared <lb/>
            that he had refused all concurrence in such wickedness. This <lb/>
            confession caused much discussion on the judgment to be <lb/>
            pronounced, and there being great difference in opinion <lb/>
            among the members of the court, it was deferred, by successive <lb/>
            adjournments, for a whole year. Meanwhile, the earl was <lb/>
            kept in close custody in the king's prison at Winchester, <lb/>
            where he often deplored his offences, confessing them with <lb/>
            tears in his eyes to the good bishops and abbots who visited <lb/>
            him in his confinement. For the space of a year, under <lb/>
            the direction of the priests, he continued his penance, <lb/>
            chanting in his daily devotions the one hundred and fifty <lb/>
            psalms of David which he had learnt in his childhood. <lb/>
            Waltheof was in person tall and stout, very handsome, and <lb/>
            superior to thousands in generosity and courage; devoted <lb/>
            to God, he listened with humility to the instructions of <lb/>
            the clergy of every class, and was a kind friend to the <lb/>
            church and the poor. For these and many other Christian <lb/>
            virtues which distinguished him above all the rest of the <lb/>
            laity, he was much beloved both by his own people and by <lb/>
            strangers who had regard to the will of God, so that his <lb/>
            deliverance from prison was anxiously looked for during the <lb/>
            year's delay. At last his enemies assembled in such numbers <lb/>
            in the king's court as to form the majority, and after much <lb/>
            discussion prevailed in getting him sentenced to death for <lb/>
            having made himself a party to the treasonable conspiracy <lb/>
            of his fellow lords by not openly resisting their designs <lb/>
            against the king's life, or at once denouncing their criminal <lb/>
            projects. No time for respite was granted, as the Nor­ <lb/>
            mans were apprehensive of his escape, and greedy to get <pb n="85"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1075.] </note> <lb/>
            posession of his ample domains and high honours. He was <lb/>
            therefore hurried, at dawn of day, while the people were yet <lb/>
            asleep, to the hill on which the church of St. Giles, abbot <lb/>
            and confessor, was afterwards built and having distributed <lb/>
            among the clergy and poor who happened to be present the <lb/>
            robes of honour which his rank of earl entitled him to wear, <lb/>
            he threw himself on the ground and continued some time in <lb/>
            prayer to God, mixed with sobbings and tears. The execu­ <lb/>
            tioners, dreading that the townsmen when they awoke <lb/>
            would rise in arms to resist the king's warrant, and, taking <lb/>
            the part of so noble a countryman, massacre the royal <lb/>
            guards, called to the kneeling earl: " Rise, sir, that we may <lb/>
            execute our lord's commands." To which he replied, " Wait <lb/>
            awhile, for the love of God Almighty, at least while I say <lb/>
            the Lord's prayer oil your behalf and my own." As they <lb/>
            gave their consent, the earl rose from the ground, and on <lb/>
            bended knees, with eyes raised to heaven and hands up­ <lb/>
            lifted, began to say aloud " Our Father which art in heaven." <lb/>
            But when he came to the last petition, having said, " Lead <lb/>
            us not into temptation," his tears fell so fast, and his sobbings <lb/>
            were so violent, that he was unable to conclude the prayer <lb/>
            he had begun. The executioner would wait no longer, but <lb/>
            drawing his sword severed the earl's head from his body <lb/>
            with a single stroke. But the head, after it was severed,2 <lb/>
            uttered with a loud and distinct voice, in the hearing of all <lb/>
            present, the words: " But deliver us from evil. Amen!" <lb/>
            Thus Earl Waltheof was beheaded at Winchester, on the <lb/>
            morning of the second of the calends of May [30th April].3 <lb/>
            His body was, without ceremony, thrown into a hole dug on <lb/>
            the spot, which is now covered with the green turf. The <lb/>
            townsmen, roused from their sleep by reports of what was <lb/>
            going on, abandoned themselves to grief, men and women <note type="footnote"> 1 The ruins of the hospital dedicated to St. Giles are still seen on the <lb/>

            Fifteen days afterwards, at Judith's request and with the <lb/>
            king's permission, Ufkytel, abbot of Croyland, came to the <lb/>
            place, and raising the bloody corpse which exhibited no signs <lb/>
            of decay, the blood being as fresh as if the earl was just <lb/>
            dead, conveyed it to the abbey of Croyland, followed by the <lb/>
            lamentations of vast crowds of people, and there gave it <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CH. XVI. Life of St. Guthlac, the hermit of Croyland, abridged from the Acts of that saint, written by the monk Felix.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I TAKE the liberty of inserting in this part of my poor <lb/>
            work an abridgment which I have lately made from the <lb/>
            Life of St. Guthlac, the hermit, at the desire of the venerable <lb/>
            prior Wulfine. A bishop of the East-Angles named Felix, a <lb/>
            native of Burgundy, and a prelate of great sanctity, wrote <lb/>
            an account of the acts of the holy hermit, which is very <lb/>
            long, and the style rather obscure.! I have cleared up its <lb/>
            difficulties, to the best of my ability, in the short compi­ <lb/>
            lation which I made in compliance with the flattering <lb/>
            request of the brethren of Croyland Abbey, where I resided <lb/>
            five weeks,2 the venerable abbot Geoffrey having kindly laid <lb/>
            his commands upon me to that effect. My account of Earl <lb/>
            Waltheof has given occasion to this notice of the holy <lb/>
            hermit, for the earl was a kind brother and ally of the <lb/>
            monks of Croyland, as I shall carefully relate in the close of <lb/>
            this history from the reports of the older brethren. I have <lb/>
            no sort of doubt that the acts of the Saxon and English <lb/>
            saints, across the channel, would be no less profitable to the <lb/>
            faithful Cisalpines, than those compiled on Greek and Egyp­ <lb/>
            tion saints by the zeal of the learned, delightful and useful <lb/>
            as those collections are. I think, moreover, that, little as <note type="footnote"> 1 The history of St. Guthlac could not have been written by Bishop <lb/>

            disciple of Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury, and monk of Jarrow, who <lb/>
            wrote it about the middle of the eighth century. Mabillon has inserted it <lb/>

            which these saints were inflamed, and with such sorrow they <lb/>
            deplored their sins from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
          <p>Guthlac was born in the time of Ethelred king of the <lb/>
            English,' Guthlac having Penvald, sprung from Ides lord of <lb/>
            the Mercians, for his father, and Tetta for his mother. At <lb/>
            his birth a sign in the heavens was manifest to the people ; <lb/>
            for a hand was seen stretched out from the clouds towards <lb/>
            a cross which stood before the door of the house where <lb/>
            Tetta was in labour. After eight days the child was bap­ <lb/>
            tized, and named Guthlac, that is, the gift of war, from the <lb/>
            tribe which is called Guthlacingas. After a gentle child­ <lb/>
            hood, when he felt the impulses of youth and studied <lb/>
            the valiant deeds of heroes, he collected his dependants <lb/>
            and gave himself up to the career of arms, ravaging and <lb/>
            destroying the villages and castles of his adversaries with <lb/>
            fire and sword. Gathering immense booty, he made volun­ <lb/>
            tary restitution of a third part of the plunder, for the love <lb/>
            of God, to those from whom it was taken. After pursuing <lb/>
            this course of life for nine years, causing great losses to his <lb/>
            enemies in person and goods, he began to reflect on the un­ <lb/>
            certainty of this mortal life and the instability of all human <lb/>
            things, and coming to himself in a state of alarm, and <lb/>
            examining his conduct as if death was before his eyes, he <lb/>
            resolved to enter on a better course of life. He therefore <lb/>
            left his comrades and relations, quitting his own country, <lb/>
            and holding cheap even the companions of his childhood for <lb/>
            the sake of Christ, and in the twenty-fourth year of his age <lb/>
            renounced all worldly vanities and entered the monastery of <lb/>
            Ripandun, when he assumed the tonsure and clerical dress <lb/>
            under the abbess whose name was Elfrida.2 From that <lb/>
            time he abstained from excessive drinking and every kind of <lb/>
            debauchery with the utmost care, devoting himself to a <lb/>
            good and religious life with all the zeal which human nature <note type="footnote">1 Ethelred, king of Mercia, 675—704, when he resigned his crown, and <lb/>

            William of Malmesbury, and which was in Cheshire. It must not be <lb/>

            convent of nuns. Another conjecture places it at Repton in Derbyshire <lb/>
            where there was a very ancient monastery. </note> <pb n="88"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IV. CH.XVI."/> <lb/>
            is capable of. For two years he was trained in sacred <lb/>
            studies and monastic discipline, but he was not content to <lb/>
            rest there, for it was his object to engage in the single <lb/>
            combat of a hermit's life and meet the enemy face to face.</p>
          <p>Having at length obtained leave from his superiors, he <lb/>
            was ferried over in a fishing-boat to a place called Croyland <lb/>
            by a man named Tatwine. There lies in the middle district <lb/>
            of England a vast and inhospitable marsh, which begins <lb/>
            from the bank of the river Granta,1 and extends over a very <lb/>
            extensive tract from south to north, parallel with the sea. <lb/>
            The surface is broken into ponds and lakes, and sometimes <lb/>
            by dark watercourses, and islands covered with thick <lb/>
            underwood, among which the rivulets wind in irregular <lb/>
            channels. Many had made the attempt to settle themselves <lb/>
            in these fens, but had been so terrified by the strange mon­ <lb/>
            sters which made it their habitation, and other alarming <lb/>
            objects, that they soon abandoned so gloomy a residence. <lb/>
            Guthlac, having surveyed Croyland in the summer season, <lb/>
            returned to his brothers and superiors, from whom he had <lb/>
            parted without taking leave; but three months afterwards, <lb/>
            on the eighth of the calends of September [24th August], <lb/>
            he returned, in company with two boys, to the spot he had <lb/>
            chosen for his hermitage, being then of the age of twenty- <lb/>
            four years. It was the day on which the feast of St. Bar­ <lb/>
            tholomew is observed, to whom he prayed to be his friend <lb/>
            and defender in all adversities.</p>
          <p>For fifteen years the saint used neither woollen nor linen <lb/>
            garments, but was covered with skins, and lived on barley- <lb/>
            bread and muddy water, using these sparingly after the sun <lb/>
            was set. Satan tried a thousand ways to entangle him in <lb/>
            his nets, or at least to drive him from his hermitage.</p>
          <p>Once he was beginning to despair of completing a work <lb/>
            on which he had laboured for three days, when suddenly <lb/>
            Bartholomew, his faithful patron, appeared to him visibly <lb/>
            during his morning watch, and allaying his fears with <lb/>
            spiritual comfort, promised him his continual help; and he <lb/>
            faithfully fulfilled his promise on various accasions in which <lb/>
            he was tempted.</p>
          <p>Another day two demons came to him in human shape, <note type="footnote"> 1 Every one knows that this is the ancient name of the Cam, on which <lb/>
            Cambridge stand?. </note> <pb n="89"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 699—714.]"/> <lb/>
            and tempted him to endeavour to fast like Moses and Elias <lb/>
            and the Egyptian fathers ; but the saint began to sing, and <lb/>
            to show his contempt of them, proceeded to eat a piece of <lb/>
            barley-bread.</p>
          <p>At one time when the man of God was employed in <lb/>
            watching and prayer through the dreary hours of the night, <lb/>
            he saw troops of demons enter his cell from all sides. <lb/>
            Having bound him hand and foot, they carried him forth <lb/>
            and plunged him into a muddy pond. They then dragged <lb/>
            him through the roughest parts of the marsh, where the <lb/>
            thorns grew thickest, and having thus torn his flesh, com­ <lb/>
            manded him to quit his hermitage. The saint refusing, <lb/>
            they scourged him with iron rods, and after subjecting him <lb/>
            to severe tortures, transported him into the cold regions <lb/>
            above the clouds. They then, accompanied by legions of <lb/>
            devils who assembled from the north, brought him with <lb/>
            threatening aspect to the gulf of Tartarus. On seeing the <lb/>
            gates of hell Guthlac began to be frightened, but despising <lb/>
            the demons' threats, he prayed inwardly to God. Instantly <lb/>
            St. Bartholomew stood by him arrayed in robes of celestial <lb/>
            light and commanded his foes to carry him back in perfect <lb/>
            safety to his own cell. The demons, groaning, obeyed the <lb/>
            apostle's commands, and angels rejoicing met him singing : <lb/>
            " The just shall go from strength to strength.”1</p>
          <p>Ortentimes and in various ways the demons tried to terrify <lb/>
            Guthlac, but, the Lord being his helper, he foiled all their <lb/>
            attempts. He stood fearless in the strength of his virtues, <lb/>
            endured severe struggles in the conflict, and defeated all <lb/>
            the attacks of the devil. In the time of Cenred, king of <lb/>
            Mercia,2 Becelin, a clerk who was tempted by the devil to <lb/>
            kill the man of God while he was renewing his tonsure, was <lb/>
            rebuked by him for conceiving such a crime in his heart. <lb/>
            But the clerk, when he saw that his wickedness was known, <lb/>
            threw himself at the saint's feet, confessed his crime, and, <lb/>
            obtaining pardon, promised thenceforth to become his com­ <lb/>
            panion.</p>
          <p>A crow, having stolen a piece of parchment, let it fall on <lb/>
            some bulrushes hanging over the water in the middle of a <lb/>
            pool, but through the merits of the man of Goa, restored it <lb/>
            safe to the writer, who had been sorely afflicted at the loss. <note type="footnote"> 1 Ps. lxxxiii. 8. </note><note type="footnote">2 Cenred, king of Mercia, 704—708. </note> <pb n="90"/>

            Two crows which frequented the island were very troublesome <lb/>
            to St. Guthlac, destroying, throwing into the water, tearing <lb/>
            to pieces, and fouling everything they could; doing all this <lb/>
            mischief indoors and out, without any respect to the man of <lb/>
            God; but he bore it all with patience, according to his vows. <lb/>
            The birds which wandered over that waste wilderness, and the <lb/>
            fishes which darted across its muddy waters, came flying and <lb/>
            swimming to his call, as sheep come to their shepherd's <lb/>
            voice, and took their food from his hand, as the instinct of <lb/>
            each required. In the presence of the venerable Wilfrid, <lb/>
            when two sparrows were flitting gaily about him, according <lb/>
            to their nature, and settled on his arms, and knees, and <lb/>
            bosom, singing, he put straw in his chimney, and so showed <lb/>
            them where to make their nest; for they would not have <lb/>
            ventured to build it in Guthlac's hermitage without his <lb/>
            leave.</p>
          <p>Wilfrid had one day brought the exiled Ethelbald1 to <lb/>
            vist the man of God, and having left his gloves in the boat <lb/>
            which brought them over, the mischievous crows carried <lb/>
            them off. The saint presently learned this, while sitting in <lb/>
            his porch, by divine inspiration, and mentioned it to Wilfrid <lb/>
            during their conference. Shortly afterwards his regrets <lb/>
            were ended by the gloves being restored by virtue of the <lb/>
            saint's faith and prayers.</p>
          <p>Whitred, a noble youth of East Anglia, was possesed by <lb/>
            the devil, by whom he was miserably vexed for four years, <lb/>
            wounding and tearing himself and all he could get at with <lb/>
            wood and iron, his teeth, and his nails. At one time, when <lb/>
            a number of men tried to manacle him, he seized an axe, and <lb/>
            killed three of them. After the four years were ended, he <lb/>
            was brought to Croyland; and the man of God, taking him <lb/>
            by the hand, led him into his oratory, and continuing in <lb/>
            prayer and fasting three days delivered him from all vexa­ <lb/>
            tions of the evil spirit.</p>
          <p>Egga, Ethelbald's companion in his exile, was so possessed <lb/>
            by an unclean spirit that he neither knew what he was, nor <lb/>
            where he was, nor what he did. In this state he was brought <lb/>
            to the threshold of Guthlac, and, having put the saint's <lb/>
            girdle round his loins, he recovered his senses, and for the <note type="footnote"> 1 Ethelbald became afterwards king of Mercia, and reigned prosperously <lb/>
            forty years, from 715—756. </note> <pb n="91"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 699—714.]"/> <lb/>
            rest of his life kept the girdle, and continued to be of a <lb/>
            sound mind.</p>
          <p>Moreover, Guthlac, the man of God, was gifted with the <lb/>
            spirit of prophecy, and was in the habit of predicting future <lb/>
            events, and telling to those who were with him what took <lb/>
            place in their absence. In this way he told to a certain <lb/>
            abbot, who came to him for a pious conference, all the <lb/>
            circumstances attending a visit by two of his clergy to a <lb/>
            widow's cottage, before the third hour, to get drunk. He <lb/>
            rebuked two other monks for concealing two bottles of beer <lb/>
            under the sands in the marsh, and kindly pardoned them as <lb/>
            they knelt before him, astonished at the extent of the saint's <lb/>
            knowledge.</p>
          <p>St. Guthlac's fame being noised abroad far and wide, <lb/>
            numbers of all ranks resorted to him ; abbots, monks, earls, <lb/>
            the rich, the poor, and the oppressed, from the neighbouring <lb/>
            districts of Mercia, and from remote quarters of Britain, all <lb/>
            seeking relief either for their souls or bodies; and each one <lb/>
            who came in faith obtained what he sought: the sick, a <lb/>
            cure; the sorrowful, joy; the penitent, consolation; and <lb/>
            every anxious soul received comfort from the conversation <lb/>
            and efficacious prayers of the man of God.</p>
          <p>Obba, one of the companions of the exile Ethelbald, <lb/>
            when walking through a rough field, was wounded in the <lb/>
            foot by thorns, which were covered by the coarse grass, so <lb/>
            that his whole body swelled from his feet to his loins, and <lb/>
            the extreme pain would not allow him either to sit, stand, or <lb/>
            lie in quiet, and he could scarcely make his way to Croyland. <lb/>
            Presently he was brought to the man of God, and the cause <lb/>
            of his pain related, upon which Guthlac wrapped round him <lb/>
            the sheepskin rug in which he was used to pray, and the <lb/>
            thorn darted from his foot, as quick as thought, like an <lb/>
            arrow from a bow. The same hour all the inflammation <lb/>
            ceased, and the sick man, restored to health, gave thanks to <lb/>
            God with those who were witnesses of his cure.</p>
          <p>It happened that Chad the bishop,1 with certain monks <lb/>
            and laymen, came to visit Guthlac, and during their journey <lb/>
            had various conversations about the holy man. The <lb/>
            bishop, finding the holy man enlightened by divine grace <lb/>
            and full of wisdom in expounding the holy scriptures, com- <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Chad, bishop of Dorchester, 676—July 6, 705. </note> <pb n="92"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IV. CH.XVI. </note> <lb/>
            pelled him by his duty of inviolable obedience to receive the <lb/>
            office of the priesthood, after he had consecrated the church <lb/>
            of Croyland, on the twelfth of the calends of September <lb/>
            [August 21st]. On this occasion the holy man was forced <lb/>
            to dine with the bishop, contrary to his habits. While there <lb/>
            he observed Wigfrid, the librarian, sitting apart, and began <lb/>
            to question him relative to the promise he had made the day <lb/>
            before to his companions on the road, that he would find out <lb/>
            whether the hermit's piety was true or pretended. Wigfrid, <lb/>
            blushing, threw himself on the ground and asked for pardon, <lb/>
            which he obtained; while all were astonished that their <lb/>
            conversation on the road was thus revealed by the Spirit of <lb/>
            God to the holy saint.</p>
          <p>The very reverend abbess Egburg, daughter of King <lb/>
            Aldulf,1 having humbly requested Guthlac by her messenger, <lb/>
            he accepted from her a leaden coffin, with a shroud to wrap <lb/>
            his corpse after his death; and when he was asked who <lb/>
            would be his successor in that place, he answered, that he <lb/>
            was still a heathen. This happened; for Cessa, who after­ <lb/>
            wards occupied his cell, was baptized some time afterwards <lb/>
            in Brittany. Child-Ethelbald,2 who was driven from place <lb/>
            to place by the persecutions of King Ceolred,3 when his <lb/>
            strength was exhausted by the sufferings he underwent, <lb/>
            came, as he was wont, to the man of God, that when human <lb/>
            counsels failed he might obtain those that were divine. <lb/>
            Guthlac administered to him the kindest consolations, pro­ <lb/>
            mising him, by inspiration of the Spirit of God, the throne <lb/>
            of his kingdom and the government of the people, and the <lb/>
            subjection of his enemies ; and all this, not by force of arms, <lb/>
            and shedding of blood, but by the hand of the Lord. These <lb/>
            things came to pass in the manner the man of God pre­ <lb/>
            dicted, for Ceolred died and Ethelbald ascended the throne.</p>
          <p>After having spent fifteen years in his hermitage, the <lb/>
            venerable Guthlac fell sick four days before Easter; but <lb/>
            making an effort beyond his strength he got up and cele­ <lb/>
            brated mass on Easter day. On the seventh day of his <lb/>
            sickness he gave orders to Beccel his servant, that when he <note type="footnote"> 1 Aldulf, king of East Anglia in Bede's time, 664—680 or 683. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Clito; " Child and Etheling.” were the Anglo-Saxon titles for the heir <lb/>

            was dead he should fetch his sister Pega to wind his corpse <lb/>
            in the shroud placed in the coffin which Egburg had sent <lb/>
            him. Then Beccel began to pray and conjure the man of <lb/>
            God to tell him before his death, who it was with whom he <lb/>
            heard him converse every morning and evening. The kind­ <lb/>
            hearted champion of God, taking breath, after a short <lb/>
            interval replied: " My son, give yourself no concern on that <lb/>
            account. What I would not reveal to any one during my <lb/>
            life I shall now open to you. From the second year of my <lb/>
            dwelling in this hermitage, the Lord sent an angel morning <lb/>
            and evening to comfort me by his discourse; and he made <lb/>
            known to me mysteries which it is not lawful for man to <lb/>
            relate; he alleviated the sufferings of my painful labours <lb/>
            by heavenly consolations; and he showed to me things <lb/>
            absent as if they were present. O my son, preserve my <lb/>
            words, and tell them to no one butto Pega or the hermit <lb/>
            Egbert." When he had finished speaking, so sweet an <lb/>
            odour proceeded from his mouth that the perfume filled the <lb/>
            whole house. The following night, while the brother Beccel <lb/>
            was watching, he perceived the whole house to be irradiated <lb/>
            with a brilliant light from midnight to the dawn of day. <lb/>
            As the sun was rising, the man of God, raising himself up <lb/>
            a little, and stretching out his hands towards the altar, <lb/>
            strengthened himself with the communion of the body and <lb/>
            blood of Christ. He then lifted his eyes to heaven and <lb/>
            raised his hands on high, and so his soul departed to <lb/>
            everlasting bliss in: the year of our Lord 715.1</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Beccel beheld the house filled with celestial <lb/>
            light, and what seemed to be a tower of flame raised from <lb/>
            earth to heaven, compared with which splendour the sun <lb/>
            paled its fires like a candle at noonday. The vault of heaven <lb/>
            rung with angelic chants, while the whole island was per­ <lb/>

            The aforesaid brother, terrified at these wonderful signs, <lb/>
            and the flashings of intense light being insupportable, took <lb/>
            a boat, and passing over to Pega, the virgin of Christ, he <lb/>
            informed her of what had taken place, and communicated to <lb/>
            her the last commands of her brother. She mourned his <lb/>
            loss with deep sorrow: the next day she accompanied the <lb/>
            reverend brother to Croyland, and the third she interred <note type="footnote"> 1 A.D. 714. Saxon Chronicle. </note> <pb n="94"/>

            Guthlac's blessed remains in the oratory, according to his <lb/>
            wishes. The Lord afterwards wrought there numerous <lb/>
            miracles by healing the sick, on account of the merits of <lb/>
            his faithful servant. On the anniversary of St. Guthlac, <lb/>
            his sister Pega assembled priests and others of the ecclesias­ <lb/>
            tical order, and opened the grave in order to transfer the <lb/>
            corpse into another tomb. The body of the saint was then <lb/>
            found to be perfect as it was in his life-time, and the clothes <lb/>
            in which it was wrapped were as white as ever, and shone <lb/>
            with all their former purity. The whole company being <lb/>
            astonished and trembling at the miracle they saw, Pega, <lb/>
            moved by the Spirit, reverently inclosed the holy body in <lb/>
            the shroud which Egburg the abbess had sent for that pur­ <lb/>
            pose during Guthlac's life, and caused the coffin to be <lb/>
            placed above-ground, as a monument; and as such it is <lb/>
            preserved with reverence to the present day.</p>
          <p>The exile Ethelbald, already named, on hearing of the <lb/>
            holy man's death, came to the spot in much affliction. He <lb/>
            was sleeping in a neighbouring hut after pouring out his <lb/>
            soul with tears and prayers at the tomb, when the saint <lb/>
            appeared to him, and, offering him consolation, promised <lb/>
            him that he should ascend the throne before a year was <lb/>
            past.1 On his asking a sign, the saint foretold, that before <lb/>
            the third hour of the morrow an unexpected supply of food <lb/>
            should be furnished for the maintenance of the dwellers in <lb/>
            Croyland; which happened accordingly. Ethelbald, having <lb/>
            succeeded to the throne, caused the tomb of the venerable <lb/>
            Guthlac to be enclosed with buildings of admirable archi­ <lb/>
            tecture and richly ornamented.</p>
          <p>A certain master of a family, in the province of Wisa,2 <lb/>
            lost his eyesight a whole year, and failed to recover it by <lb/>
            the application of any sort of ointment. At length he was <lb/>
            brought to Croyland, full of faith, and seeking a conference <lb/>
            with the holy virgin Pega, received permission to enter the <lb/>
            oratory and stretch himself by the side of the sacred re­ <lb/>
            mains. Meanwhile Pega dissolved in water a particle of <note type="footnote"> 1 As observed in a former note, Ethelbald succeeded to the throne of <lb/>

          <p>THUS far I have followed the account of bishop Felix1 in <lb/>
            my short abridgment of the acts of St. Guthlac, inserted in <lb/>
            this work for the glory of God and the edification of the <lb/>
            faithful. What now remains to be told of the building of <lb/>
            Croyland Abbey and its possession by the monks, I derive <lb/>
            from the exact recital made to me by Ansgot the sub-prior, <lb/>
            and others of the oldest monks. King Ethelbald, as his <lb/>
            blessed comforter was displaying his glory in the working <lb/>
            of miracles, visited his tomb with joy, and granted for ever <lb/>
            to the servants of the saint the possessions which he had <lb/>
            conferred on him on mounting the throne.2 For on one <lb/>
            occasion, the king coming to Croyland to visit his patron <lb/>
            before his departure, the man of God asked for the grant of <lb/>
            a quiet abode in the island, and Ethelbald gave him a tract <lb/>
            of land five miles long on the east, where it was bounded by <lb/>
            a ditch, called Asen-dyk,s three on the west, two on the <lb/>
            south, and two on the north, free from all rent, and secular <note type="footnote"> 1 See note before, p. 86. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ordericus seems to have forgotten that in the preceding chapter he <lb/>
            has made St. Guthlac's death precede Ethelbald's accession. We may <lb/>
            suppose that this gift may have been promised, or perhaps even made, in <lb/>
            anticipation; but our author's language in the succeeding sentence is precise <lb/>
            as to an actual grant to the saint. Ingulphus gives the charter, the date of <lb/>
            which is 716. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This ditch, which was in the neighbourhood of Spalding, lay to the <lb/>

            customs and demands of every sort. The charter granting <lb/>
            it was sealed by Ethelbald In the presence of his bishops <lb/>
            and great men.</p>
          <p>The soil of Croyland being marshy, as the name indicates, <lb/>
            (for Croyland signifies a crude or spongy land), it would <lb/>
            not allow of a foundation of masonry, and therefore king <lb/>
            Ethelbald caused an immense number of oak piles to be <lb/>
            driven into the ground, and hard earth to be conveyed in <lb/>
            boats from the uplands,1 at a distance of nine miles, and <lb/>
            mixed with the loose soil of the marsh. Thus he laid the <lb/>
            foundations of a stone church, which he afterwards com­ <lb/>
            pleted, but St. Guthlac had been content with an oratory of <lb/>
            wattled boughs. The king assembled there men devoted to <lb/>
            a religious life, founded a monastery, enriched it with orna­ <lb/>
            ments, revenues, and other possessions, in honour of God and <lb/>
            the holy hermit to whom he had been firmly attached by <lb/>
            reason of the soothing consolation he had often received <lb/>
            from him during his banishment. He showed his regard for <lb/>
            the place all his life, and since its first foundation by this <lb/>
            king the house of Croyland has not ceased to be a settlement <lb/>
            of monks to the present day. Kenulf,2 who governed the <lb/>
            monastery of St. Guthlac for some time, had a great reputa­ <lb/>
            tion in those days, and from him the boundary stone which <lb/>
            he set up between the abbey lands and those of the people <lb/>
            of Deeping,3 is still called Kenulf-stan.</p>
          <p>England was soon afterwards shaken by the tempests of <lb/>
            successive wars, and the native kings being defeated by <lb/>
            Inguar, Halfdene, and Guthrum,4 and other Danish and <lb/>
            Norwegian chiefs, the abbey of Croyland was ravaged, like <lb/>
            many others; it was stripped of its ornaments, the farms <lb/>
            laid waste, and subjected to laymen contrary to canonical <lb/>
            law. But the divine goodness, which sometimes allows the <lb/>
            wicked to prevail for a season to punish 'the people's sins, <lb/>
            saw fit, after their chastisement, to restore quiet times under <lb/>
            the government of their lawful rulers. The cruel tyrants <note type="footnote"> 1 " Uppalonda:" our author has coined a Latin word to render literally <lb/>

            numbers of the faithful, and had given the churches of the <lb/>

            were, by God's help, destroyed, subjugated, or expelled; <lb/>
            Alfred, son of King Ethelwulf, obtaining the ascendancy, and <lb/>
            being the first of the English kings who was monarch of all <lb/>
            England. After him, his son Edward, surnamed the Elder, <lb/>
            had a long and prosperous reign, and at his death left his <lb/>
            dominions to his three sons, Athelstan, Edmund, and Edred. <lb/>
            All these successively ascended the throne of England, and <lb/>
            each in his time exerted himself to govern well and benefit <lb/>
            his subjects.'</p>
          <p>In the time of king Edred, a clerk at London named <lb/>
            Turkytel asked the king to give him the abbey of Croyland, <lb/>
            with which request the king willingly complied. This clerk <lb/>
            was of the royal race, and a relation of Oskytel2 metropolitan <lb/>
            of York; he was very wealthy, having vast domains, all which <lb/>
            he thought of no value compared with the heavenly inheri­ <lb/>
            tance. He had asked Croyland of the king, as we have <lb/>
            already seen, not to increase his possessions, but because he <lb/>
            knew the religious men who dwelt in its solitudes surrounded <lb/>
            by swamps and marshes, and determined to devote himself <lb/>
            there to God's worship, spurning all the delights of the <lb/>
            present world. Having therefore ordered his affairs with <lb/>
            prudence, he became a monk of Croyland; and the number of <lb/>
            monks having been increased by his -zeal, he became their <lb/>
            superior and abbot, by the will of God and lawful election of <lb/>
            the brethren. Turkytel was an intimate friend of some of the <lb/>
            holy bishops who then presided over the English church. <note type="footnote"> 1 It is singular that, among so many circumstantial details connected <lb/>
            with the history of Croyland abbey, our author, after describing its flour­ <lb/>
            ishing state at its first foundation, should proceed to give an account of its <lb/>
            restoration after the devastations of the Danes, without any particular <lb/>
            account of that memorable passage in its annals. This is the more <lb/>
            extraordinary as the preceding paragraph has the character of a peroration <lb/>
            preparatory to some precise information on the subject of this disaster, and <lb/>
            it would almost appear that a paragraph containing it is wanting. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Turkytel and Oskytel are clearly Danish names, as were those of some <lb/>
            of the first abbots and monks of Croyland after its restoration, and many of <lb/>
            their domains betray the same origin. In fact, Croyland became the <lb/>
            favourite religious house and seat of education of the Anglo-Danes, who <lb/>
            formed so large a part of the population of the middle and eastern districts <lb/>

            Winchester, and Oswald, bishop of Worcester, afterwards <lb/>
            archbishop of York, by whose counsels he earnestly strove <lb/>
            to be guided. He was, as I have before remarked, of high <lb/>
            birth, and, inheriting sixty manors from his ancestors, he <lb/>
            gave for the good of their souls six vills to the abbey of <lb/>
            Croyland, viz., Wendlinburg, Beby, Wridthorpe, Elminton, <lb/>
            Cottenham, and Oakington.1 The charter was confirmed by <lb/>
            the seal of the powerful king Edgar, son of King Edmund. <lb/>
            Archbishop Dunstan also and his suffragans ratified the <lb/>
            grant of the aforesaid lands by making the sign of the cross <lb/>
            on the charter, and the archbishop denounced the penalty of <lb/>
            excommunication,2 and eternal malediction on those who <lb/>
            should plunder the church of any of the possessions before <lb/>
            named, unless they made sufficient amends.</p>
          <p>A long time afterwards, Turkytel having died on the <lb/>
            4th of the ides [12th] of July,3 was succeeded by his nephew <lb/>
            Egelric, who on his death left the abbey of Croyland to <lb/>
            another Egelric, his kinsman. At his decease Oskytel, a <lb/>
            monk who was of the royal race, was made abbot. His <lb/>
            sister Leniova was abbess of Eynesbury,4 where the body of <lb/>
            St. Neot, abbot and confessor,5 then lay, but the service was <lb/>
            not such as befitted the memory of so great a saint. In <lb/>
            consequence, this lady removed to Whittlesea and invited <lb/>
            there abbot Oskytel her brother, and some monks of Croy­ <lb/>
            land, and delivered to them the body of St. Neot, which she <lb/>
            had brought there with all honour, thinking them more <lb/>
            worthy than herself. The monks received with joy the gift <lb/>
            God had sent them, and deposited it with great ceremony <lb/>
            near the altar of St. Mary, mother of God, on the north <note type="footnote"> 1 See the charter in Ingulphus. Its date is 966. Beby is in Leicester­ <lb/>

            of Oskytel, on the twelfth of the calends of November <lb/>

            the way of all flesh on the fourteenth of the calends of <lb/>
            February [14th January],2 Brihtmer was appointed abbot.</p>
          <p>At that time there was a convent at Pegeland,3 presided <lb/>
            over by an abbot named Wulfgate, a man of noble birth. <lb/>
            There Pega, St. Guthlac's sister, was for a long time a servant <lb/>
            of the Lord. After her brother's death, she used all her <lb/>
            endeavours to wear out her life for the love of Christ, by <lb/>
            still severer austerities. She therefore undertook a pilgrim­ <lb/>
            age to Rome, to pray at the threshold of the holy apostles <lb/>
            for herself and her kinsfolk, and she there triumphantly <lb/>
            departed on the sixth of the ides [8th] of January.4 Her <lb/>
            remains repose in the church built at Rome to her honour <lb/>
            by the faithful, and are in high veneration for the many <lb/>
            benefits conferred by her on those who faithfully invoke <lb/>
            her.</p>
          <p>Brihtmer, abbot of Croyland, having died on the seventh <lb/>
            of the ides [7th] of April,5 Wulfgate, the superior of the <lb/>
            monastery of Pegeland, asked permission of King Edward, <lb/>
            son of Ethelred, to unite the flocks of the two monasteries, <lb/>
            and to make of them, for God's glory, a single convent, <lb/>
            under one abbot and one rule, which the king soon af­ <lb/>
            terwards graciously acceded to. After having the charge <lb/>
            of Croyland for a number of years, Wulfgate died on the <lb/>
            nones [7th] of July,6 and Ulfkytel, a monk of Peterborough, <lb/>
            by permission of his abbot Leofric, received the government <lb/>
            of the abbey of Croyland from King Edward. He held it <lb/>
            twenty-four years, and began the building of a new church, <lb/>
            the old one threatening to fall to ruins. His great patron <lb/>
            in this undertaking was Waltheof, earl of Isorthampton, <note type="footnote"> 1 In the year 1005. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In 1018. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 " Now Peakirk in Northamptonsire.”—Le Prévost. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Pega's journey to Rome is supposed to have been made in the year <lb/>

            Barnack1 to the servants of God and St. Guthlac. Not <lb/>
            long afterwards the malice of the Normans, who were <lb/>
            jealous of him, and feared his distinguished qualities, brought <lb/>

          <p>Not long afterwards, this abbot, who was English born, <lb/>
            and therefore disliked by the Normans, being accused by <lb/>
            his competitors, was deposed by archbishop Lanfranc, <lb/>
            and sent into confinement at Glastonbury.2 Upon this, <lb/>
            the abbey of Croyland was conferred by King William <lb/>
            on Ingulfus, a monk of Fontenelles; and he governed it <lb/>
            twenty-four years in difficult circumstances. He was an <lb/>

            made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. On his return, he went <lb/>
            to Fontenelles and assumed the monastic habit under Abbot <lb/>
            Gerbert, from whom, having made proficiency in the con­ <lb/>
            ventual rules, he received the office of prior. The king, <lb/>
            who had long known him, requested his abbot to give him <lb/>
            up, and sent him to preside over the monks of Croyland. <lb/>
            After he became abbot, he kindly used his influence with <lb/>
            King William on behalf of his predecessor, and obtained <lb/>
            permission for him to return to Peterborough abbey, of <lb/>
            which he had been a monk, and where he died some years <lb/>
            afterwards on the 7th of the ides [7th] of June.4</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, abbot Ingulfus did all he could to benefit the <lb/>
            monastery of which he had undertaken the charge; but he <lb/>
            had, by God's will, to struggle with many difficulties. In <lb/>

            vestments, books, and many other necessary articles, were <lb/>
            consumed by a fire which broke out suddenly.1 Then, he <lb/>
            himself, being grievously afflicted with the gout, was in a <lb/>
            bad state of health long before his death, but his active <lb/>
            mind would not allow the society to suffer by his infirmities. <lb/>
            Ingulphus caused the remains of Earl AValtheof to be trans­ <lb/>
            ferred from the chapter-house into the church, and ordered <lb/>
            warm water to be got ready to wash the bones. But when <lb/>
            the lid of the coffin was removed, the corpse was discovered <lb/>
            to be as sound after its repose of sixteen years as on the <lb/>
            day it was buried, and the head was reunited to the body; <lb/>
            only there was a red streak round the neck where the head <lb/>
            had been severed; and this was seen by the monks and <lb/>
            several laymen who had gathered round. The body having <lb/>
            been thus translated into the church, and interred with <lb/>
            great ceremony near the altar,2 miracles were often per­ <lb/>
            formed there. The truth of this is experienced by the sick, <lb/>
            who, seeking their cure in faith, frequently obtain the benefit <lb/>
            they implore.</p>
          <p>At length, Abbot Ingulph, dying on the sixteenth of the <lb/>
            calends of December [16th November],3 he was succeeded <lb/>
            by Geoffrey, who conferred many benefits on the abbey of <lb/>
            Croyland and its inhabitants, through his love of goodness <lb/>
            and virtue. He was a Frenchman by birth, of the city of <lb/>
            Orleans, and having pursued liberal studies from an early <lb/>
            age, and become deeply versed in literature, took a distaste <lb/>
            to worldly objects, and, inflamed with divine love, devoted <lb/>
            himself to a monastic life in the abbey of St. Evroult, <lb/>
            which that saint had founded at Ouche in the time of <lb/>
            Childebert, king of the Franks.4 In that monastery where <lb/>
            piety is more abundant than wealth, Geoffrey becoming a <lb/>
            novice under Abbot Mainier, whose zeal procured him a great <lb/>
            reputation, after a time took the vows and became a monk, <lb/>

            the year of our Lord 1109,1 by command of Henry king of <lb/>
            England, he undertoook the government of the abbey of <lb/>
            Croyland. He began the new church in a splendid style cf <lb/>
            architecture, and many other useful works ; and during the <lb/>
            fifteen years he held the dignity of abbot, earnestly la­ <lb/>
            boured for their completion, for the benefit of his own soul <lb/>
            and of those committed to his charge.</p>
          <p>In the third year of abbot Ingulph, miracles began to <lb/>
            be wrought at the tomb of Earl Waltheof, the news of which <lb/>
            caused great delight among his countrymen. The English <lb/>
            common people crowded in great numbers to his tomb, <lb/>
            hearing that God had honoured him with many significant <lb/>
            tokens of his merits, and both exhibiting their joy at this <lb/>
            new thing, and interceding for succour in their various ne­ <lb/>
            cessities. On seeing this, a Norman monk whose name was <lb/>
            Audin, was much enraged, laughing at the crowd of votaries <lb/>
            and mocking and disparaging the earl himself, and giving <lb/>
            out that he was a base traitor and deserved to lose his head <lb/>
            for his crime, as he had done. Abbot Geoffrey, hearing of <lb/>
            this, mildly expostulated with Audin, as he was a foreigner, <lb/>
            reminding him that it was sinful to disparage the divine <lb/>
            operations, because God had promised to display his pre­ <lb/>
            sence to the faithful to the end of the world, and had de­ <lb/>
            clared that the sincerely penitent should drink of the <lb/>
            fountain of his inexhaustible mercy. However, while the <lb/>
            abbot was thus endeavouring to restrain his folly, and he <lb/>
            vented his spleen in words which became continually more <lb/>
            unbeseeming, he was suddenly seized with fainting at the <lb/>
            heart in the abbot's presence, and died a few days after­ <lb/>
            wards in the church of St. Alban the first English martyr ; <lb/>
            where he had made his monastic profession. The following <lb/>
            night, when Abbot Geoffrey was lying on his bed reflecting <lb/>
            anxiously on the events just related, he presently saw <lb/>
            himself in a vision at the tomb of Earl Waltheof, and <lb/>
            the holy saints, Bartholomew the apostle and Guthlac the <lb/>
            hermit, standing near in robes of shining white. The apostle, <lb/>
            as appeared in the vision, laid his hand on the head of the <lb/>
            earl reunited to the body, saying: " He is not headless." <lb/>
            Guthlac, who stood at the foot of the corpse, now took up the <note type="footnote"> 1 Abbot Geoffrey was installed on Palm Sunday, 1110. </note> <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 112.] <lb/>
            </note>word, and said : " He was an earl... The apostle inter­ <lb/>
            rupted the speaker and thus finished the sentence : " And is <lb/>
            now a king.”1 The abbot having heard these things and re­ <lb/>
            ported them to the brethren, they were filled with joy and <lb/>
            gave glory to the Lord God, who in all ages never ceases to <lb/>
            show his mercy to those who believe in him. Having spent <lb/>
            fifteen years in his government, the venerable abbot and priest <lb/>
            Geoffrey died on the nones [5th] of June; and was succeeded <lb/>
            by Waltheof, an Englishman and monk of Croyland, who <lb/>
            was brother of Earl Cospatrick,2 and of high English lineage. <lb/>
            Miracles becoming more frequent at Croyland the monks <lb/>
            were filled with joy, and wishing to pay all the honour in <lb/>
            their power to the remains of the great earl, engaged Vita­ <lb/>
            lis, the Englishman, to write his epitaph in heroic verse. <lb/>
            Paying a ready obedience to their request, after some <lb/>
            reflection, he repeated the following verses ;- <lb/>
            Beneath this stone a noble warrior lies, <lb/>
            Earl Waltheof, great in arms, in council wise; <lb/>
            Stout Siward's son, 'twas his an ancient race <lb/>
            Through Danish Jarls, Northumbrian earls to trace. <lb/>
            But honours, power, and riches counting dross, <lb/>
            With contrite heart he knelt before the cross: <lb/>
            For Christ he loved, his righteous judgments feared, <lb/>
            His servants honour'd, and his saints revered. <lb/>
            But chief, where Croyland spreads her wide domain, <lb/>
            And holy Guthlac holds his mystic reign, <lb/>
            He joyed to tread the cloister's hallowed ground, <lb/>
            Her monks he cherish'd, and her altars crown'd. <lb/>
            On Winton's hill the patriot bow'd his head, <lb/>
            By Norman malice numbered with the dead. <lb/>
            Ah, fatal last of May !3 Unrighteous doom ! <lb/>
            Now marshy Croyland boasts her patron's tomb, <lb/>
            Where, living, oft he came an honour'd guest: <lb/>

            a great oath that he would not raise the siege till he had <lb/>
            taken the place. But by the overruling will of God, <lb/>
            things turned out very differently; for while the king, <lb/>
            having pitched his tents, was swelling with pride, and <lb/>

            bodies of troops, hastening to the relief of the besieged <lb/>

            received no account of the approaching succour, and de­ <lb/>
            camped at once. But his retreat was attended with severe <lb/>

            their tents, baggage, arms, and all kinds of utensils and <lb/>

            the ceremonies of which were conducted with great state at <lb/>

            connected with her. Diffusing around her the balm of <lb/>
            peace, she was kind to the poor, and treated with great <lb/>
            respect all the servants of God, who were greatly afflicted <lb/>
            at her death, and the more so as she left no offspring. All <lb/>

          <p>The widowed church of Dive, on the loss of her former <lb/>

            that house for many years in the time of King William and <lb/>
            several under duke Robert II., and advanced it nobly as <lb/>
            opportunity occurred.2 This lord carried with him from St. <lb/>

            Richard, William de Montreuil, and Turketel, quick and <lb/>
            skilful copyists, and well skilled in the services of the <lb/>
            church. These were his peaceful coadjutors, and took the lead <lb/>
            in zealously putting their shoulders to God's work both by <lb/>
            day and night, saying cheerfully to others their associates <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>ROBERT, the king's son, it is reported, was the cause and <lb/>
            fomenter of the disturbances which broke out as we have <lb/>
            seen, between the people of Maine and the Normans; for <lb/>
            Duke William, both before the battle of Senlac, and after­ <lb/>
            wards at a time when he fell sick, had declared his eldest <lb/>
            son Robert his heir, causing all his barons to do him fealty <lb/>
            and homage, which they had readily consented to. But the <lb/>
            young prince, after the death of his wife Margaret, urged <lb/>
            on by youthful ambition and the imprudent suggestions of <lb/>
            those about him, demanded of his father the honours which <lb/>
            he claimed as his right, viz., the sovereignty of Maine <lb/>
            and Normandy.5 His politic father, after much reflec- <note type="footnote"> I Abbot Ainard died on the 14th of January, 1078. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Fulk, who was consecrated by Robert , bibhop of Séez, disgusted the <lb/>

            his son to wait for a more fitting opportunity of obtaining <lb/>
            what he desired. The prince was talkative and prodigal, <lb/>
            very bold and valiant, and a strong and sure archer; his <lb/>
            voice was loud and clear; his tongue fluent; his features <lb/>
            dull and heavy; his body stout, and his stature short; <lb/>
            whence he commonly received the surname of Gambaron1 <lb/>
            or Courte-heuse.</p>
          <p>One day, when the king was preparing an expedition <lb/>
            against the inhabitants of the Corbonnais,2 and was enter­ <lb/>
            tained at the house of Gunher, in the village of Richer <lb/>
            (which is called L'Aigle, on account of an eagle's nest <lb/>
            being found in an oak tree while Fulbert was building his <lb/>
            castle), a diabolical quarrel arose between the king's sons, <lb/>
            from which sprung afterwards endless contentions and <lb/>
            crimes.3 For two of the brothers, William Rufus and <lb/>
            Henry, took their father's part, and thinking their strength <lb/>
            equal to their brother Robert's, were indignant that he <lb/>
            alone should make pretensions to their father's inheritance, <lb/>
            and affect equality with the king among the crowd of para­ <lb/>
            sites who paid their court to himself. In consequence they <lb/>
            came to the castle of L'Aigle to visit Robert, who was <lb/>
            sojourning in the house of Robert Calcege, and there began <lb/>
            to play at dice in the gallery,4 as the custom of military men <lb/>
            is. They then made a great noise, and threw water on the <lb/>
            heads of Robert and his hangers-on who were underneath.5 <lb/>

            Robert: " Why do you put up with this insult ? see your <lb/>
            brothers have mounted above you, and shower their filth <lb/>
            upon you and us, in contempt. Do not you perceive what <lb/>
            they mean ? if you do not instantly resent this insult, you <lb/>
            are a lost man, and can never lift up your head again." This <lb/>
            speech roused his fury, and he hurried to the banqueting <lb/>
            room where his brothers were, determined to chastise them. <lb/>
            The clamour which ensued brought the king from his lodg­ <lb/>
            ings, and by interposing his royal authority he put an end, <lb/>
            for the time, to his sons' quarrels. But the night after­ <lb/>
            wards, Robert and his attendants withdrew from the king's <lb/>
            troop of horse, and making for Rouen attempted to seize <lb/>
            the castle by surprise. However, Roger D'Ivry, the king's <lb/>
            butler, who had the custody of the tower, having anticipated <lb/>
            the plot, put the fortifications in order to resist the treason­ <lb/>
            able enterprise, and in all haste sent messengers to his lord <lb/>
            the king, to apprize him of the state of affairs. The king <lb/>
            in his wrath ordered all the malcontents to be arrested; <lb/>
            hearing which they were in the greatest consternation. <lb/>
            Some were taken, others fled and secured their safety by <lb/>
            taking refuge in foreign countries.</p>
          <p>Then Hugh de Chateau-Neuf, nephew and heir of Albert <lb/>
            Ribald, was the first to receive the exiles, and opened the <lb/>
            gates of Chateau-Neuf, Raimalard, Sorely and other places <lb/>
            belonging to him, in order that they might make predatory <lb/>
            incursions on Normandy. He was son-in-law of Earl <lb/>
            Roger, having married Mabel,2 sister of Robert de Belesme, <lb/>
            who had attached himself to the king's son, with Ralph de <lb/>
            Conches and many others. These deserters, embarking in <lb/>
            a wicked and detestable enterprise, had left their towns and <lb/>
            rich farms for vain hopes and worthless promises. The <lb/>
            king took their domains into his own hands, and with the <lb/>
            rents paid the stipendiary troops who fought against them.</p>
          <p>These troubles caused great commotions among the inha­ <lb/>
            bitants of the country and their neighbours, who flew to <lb/>
            arms in every quarter either for or against the king. The <lb/>
            French, the Bretons, the Manceaux, the Angevins, and other <lb/>
            people fluctuated in their opinions, and knew not which side <note type="footnote"> 1 Remalard, in the department de l'Orme; Sorel in Eure et Loire. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Mabel de Montgomery, third daughter of Count Roger and Mabel de <lb/>

            they ought to take. War threatening them on all sides, the <lb/>
            king, full of determination, assembled an army, and marching <lb/>
            against the enemy, made terms with Rotrou count de <lb/>
            Mortagne. This count had often pillaged the lands of the <lb/>
            church of Chartres, which is dedicated to St. Mary-ever-a- <lb/>
            Virgin, and having been frequently remonstrated with by the <lb/>
            bishop and clergy, and continuing incorrigible, had been ex­ <lb/>
            communicated. By an infliction of divine justice, he became <lb/>
            deaf, and remained so to the end of his days. King William <lb/>
            took him into his pay, employing him with his own troops <lb/>
            in the siege of Raimalard, because it was a fief held of him.</p>
          <p>He fortified four castles in the country round, and placed <lb/>
            garrisons in them. Meanwhile, on a certain day, Aimer de <lb/>
            Villerai1 was conducting the steward of the king of France' <lb/>
            on his return to his master, and came with three men-at- <lb/>
            arms to his own castle, where King William's enemies <lb/>
            were protected, when it chanced that four knights of the <lb/>
            .royal army sallied forth and stopped his way, just as he <lb/>
            had nearly reached the castle gate, and falling upon him <lb/>
            killed him on the spot. They then laid the body of the un­ <lb/>
            fortunate freebooter across a horse, like the carcass of a pig, <lb/>
            and threw it down before the huts of count Roger with <lb/>
            whom he had long been in hostilities. Goulfier, Aimer's son, <lb/>
            struck with terror at his father's fearful end, made peace <lb/>
            with the king, and he and his heirs remained faithful more <lb/>
            than fifty years.</p>
          <p>The calamities which threaten the sons of earth are end­ <lb/>
            less, and if they were all carefully committed to writing <lb/>
            would fill large volumes. It is now winter, and I am <lb/>

          <p>TREADING in the steps of those who have gone before us, it <lb/>
            is our duty to contend ceaselessly with enervating sloth, <lb/>
            devoting ourselves to profitable studies and healthful exer­ <lb/>
            cises, by application to which the mind is purified from <lb/>
            vice, the life-giving discipline nobly arming it against all <lb/>
            wickedness. " Every slothful man," says Solomon, " is a <lb/>
            slave to his desires." And again.: " The desire of the <lb/>
            slothful killeth him."1 He indeed is slothful and idle who <lb/>
            abandons himself to a vicious life for want of a good reso­ <lb/>
            lution. That man may be considered as sunk in the lethargy <lb/>
            of idleness who fails to meditate on the law of God day and <lb/>
            night, that is; in prosperity and adversity, and does not <lb/>
            earnestly struggle to resist the wiles and assaults of Satan <lb/>
            that he may be worthy to obtain the reward of his heavenly <lb/>
            calling. Such a one, doubtless, hurtful desire killeth;" <lb/>
            drawing him into evil courses, while he is lulled to sleep by <lb/>
            prosperity, and sinking him into the pit of perdition by the <lb/>
            broad road of his own lusts. The ancients therefore strongly <lb/>
            condemn idleness and sloth as the enemy of the soul, in­ <lb/>
            viting their followers to profitable labour and exertion, both <lb/>
            by word and example ; and on this point the heathen poets <lb/>
            agree with Christian writers. For Virgil says :- <lb/>
            Ah! what avail his Service, what his toil ? <lb/>
            Stern labour all subdues <lb/>
            And ceaseless toil that urging want pursues.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Provo xxi. 25. The preceding quotation is not to be found in the <lb/>

          <p>Weighing with attention, father Warin, such sentiments as <lb/>
            these, I have determined to publish something which may be <lb/>
            useful and interesting to our brethren in the house of the <lb/>
            Lord, pursuing with diligence the task I have commenced, <lb/>
            that when the Lord cometh to judgment I may not be con­ <lb/>
            demned, like the unprofitable servant, for having buried my <lb/>
            talent in the ground. In the first instance, I endeavoured <lb/>
            to obey the commands of the venerable abbot Roger, and <lb/>
            yours also, received at a later period, by undertaking a short <lb/>
            account of the state of the abbey of Ouche, a work which <lb/>
            our predecessors have often called on each other to engage <lb/>
            in, but which none of them have been willing to undertake <lb/>
            for they chose rather to be silent than to speak, preferring <lb/>
            tranquil leisure to the consuming toil of investigating past <lb/>
            transactions. They were willing enough to peruse the acts <lb/>
            of former abbots and brethren, and the annals of their own <lb/>
            house, which, having been slenderly endowed at first by poor <lb/>
            but pious founders, have been gradually aggrandized by the <lb/>
            indefatigable exertions of our reverend fathers; but they <lb/>
            shrunk from bending their minds to the task of dictating or <lb/>
            writing the result of their researches. At length it fell to my <lb/>
            lot, a stranger and an Englishman, who coming here, when <lb/>
            only ten years old, from the furthest borders of Mercia,2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Otia corrodunt mentes et corpora frangunt. <lb/>

            Norman events and transactions for the use of the natives <lb/>

            published two books,' in which I have given a true account <lb/>
            of the restoration of our house and of three of our abbots, <lb/>

            and experience.</p>
          <p>I now begin my third book from the year of our Lord <lb/>
            1075, meaning to treat of my own abbot and the society of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, as well as of public affairs generally, during the suc­ <lb/>
            ceeding period of twelve years, that is, to the time of King <lb/>
            William's death.2 I choose the former year for the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of my present undertaking, because it was then <lb/>
            I was born, on the fourteenth of the calends of March <lb/>
            [16th February], and was regenerated in the holy font of <lb/>
            baptism by the ministry of Ordericus the priest,3 at Atting­ <lb/>
            ham, in the church of St. Eata the confessor,4 which stands <lb/>
            on the bank of the river Severn. Five years afterwards, my <lb/>
            father entrusted me to a noble priest, whose name was <lb/>
            Siward, for instruction in the first rudiments of learning, to <lb/>
            whose mastership I remained subject for five years. Then, <lb/>
            being in my eleventh year, I was separated from my father, <lb/>
            for the love of God, and sent a young exile from England to <lb/>
            Normandy to enter the service of the King Eternal. Here <lb/>

          <p>If our bishops and other rulers of the world were so <lb/>
            gifted with sanctity that, for them and by them, miracles <lb/>
            were divinely wrought, as was frequently the case with the <lb/>
            primitive fathers, and these accounts scattered through <lb/>
            ancient books sweetly influence the readers' mind, refresh­ <lb/>
            ing their memories with the glorious signs and wonders of <lb/>
            the early disciples; I also would fain shake off sloth, and <lb/>
            employ myself in committing to writing whatever may be <lb/>
            worthy of the eager ken of posterity. But in the present <lb/>
            age, in which the love of many waxes cold and iniquity <lb/>
            abounds, miracles, the tokens of sanctity, cease,2 while crimes <lb/>
            and lamentable complaints multiply in the world. The <lb/>
            litigious quarrels of bishops, and the bloody conflicts of <lb/>
            princes, furnish more abundant materials for the writers of <lb/>
            history than the propositions of theologians, or the pri­ <lb/>
            vations or prodigies of ascetics. The time of antichrist is <lb/>
            at hand, whose appearance, as the Lord intimated to holy <lb/>
            Job,3 will be preceded by the failure of miracles and the <lb/>
            rapid growth of outrageous vices in those who are given up <lb/>
            to their own fleshly lusts. Now, most reverend abbot, I <lb/>
            will resolutely apply myself, in the name of the Lord, to the <lb/>
            task I have undertaken, trusting with confidence that your <lb/>
            experience will correct whatever errors my own ignorance <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>[1075—1127.] IN the year of our Lord 1075, the four­ <lb/>
            teenth indiction, King William spent the holy feast of <lb/>
            Easter at Fécamp, and presented his daughter Cecilia to be <lb/>
            consecrated to God by the hands of Archbishop John.1 She <lb/>
            had been brought up with great care, and well educated in <lb/>
            the convent at Caen, where, being dedicated to the holy <lb/>
            and undivided Trinity, she became a nun under the vene­ <lb/>
            rable abbess Matildà, faithfully submitting to the holy rule. <lb/>
            The reverend mother departing this life after governing <lb/>
            the convent forty-seven years, Cecilia succeeded her, and <lb/>
            having presided over the nuns for nearly fourteen years <lb/>
            with great credit, she expired on the third of the ides <lb/>
            [13th] of July, in the year of our Lord 1127. She thus <lb/>
            worthily devoted herself to the service of God, in the habit, <lb/>
            and order, and religious exercises of a nun, for fifty-two <lb/>
            years after she was first dedicated by her father,2 and her <lb/>
            death happened in the twenty-sixth year of the reign of her <lb/>
            brother Henry.</p>
          <p>While King William was residing in Normandy, and, by <lb/>
            God's help, defended his dominions against all adversaries, <lb/>
            the English bishops, Lanfranc of Canterbury, Thomas of <lb/>
            York, and Remi of Lincoln, undertook a journey to Rome, <lb/>
            and were received with great honours by Pope Gregory and <lb/>
            the Roman senate.3 The wealth of England supplied pro- <note type="footnote"> 1 It would appear by the charter of foundation of the abbey of Caen, <lb/>
            referred to by the French editor of Ordericus, that it was there, and under <lb/>
            Archbishop Maurillius, and not John, and in the year 1066, not 1075, <lb/>
            that William and Matilda caused their daughter Cecilia to be consecrated <lb/>
            a nun of the abbey of the Holy Trinity on the day it was dedicated. If <lb/>
            this be so, it is singular that our author should have fallen into error on <lb/>
            facts which, though not of any public importance, occurred so near his own <lb/>
            times. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 According to the correction just proposed, Cecilia's religious life <lb/>
            extended to sixty-one years, of which she was abbess only seven. The <lb/>
            abbess Matilda died on the Gth of July, 1120. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The journey of the three prelates took place in <unclear>1071</unclear>, when Alexander <lb/>
            II. was pope, not Gregory VII. Alexander having been a pupil of <lb/>

            appeared to the Latins no less admirable for their munifi­ <lb/>
            cence than for their eloquence and their learning, both <lb/>
            sacred and profane. The pope and clergy of Rome received <lb/>
            favourably the message of King William, accompanying the <lb/>
            offerings, of which the bishops were bearers, and readily <lb/>
            confirmed the privileges, formerly granted to his prede­ <lb/>
            cessors, which the king demanded by his envoys.'</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 1077,2 the bishops just named <lb/>
            returned to Normandy highly delighted, and the king with <lb/>
            all the Norman people were transported with joy at their <lb/>
            arrival. At that time several churches in Normandy were <lb/>
            consecrated with great ceremony, at which the king and <lb/>
            queen, with their sons Robert and William, and vast assem­ <lb/>
            blages of the nobles and commons were present. The <lb/>
            mother churches of the bishoprics of Bayeux and Evreux <lb/>
            and the abbey church of Bee, were dedicated to the honour <lb/>
            of St. Mary, mother of God, always a virgin.</p>
          <p>The same year, the abbey church of St. Stephen the pro­ <lb/>
            to-martyr, at Caen, was also consecrated, being enriched by <lb/>
            the king and his nobles with valuable offerings and large <lb/>
            sums of money. The solemnities of these consecrations <lb/>
            were performed by John archbishop of Rouen and his suffra­ <lb/>
            gans, the reverend metropolitans Lanfranc and Thomas being <lb/>
            present, with many abbots and a vast concourse of people.</p>
          <p>The venerable abbot Herluin rejoiced in spirit at the <note type="footnote"> that he paid him this mark of respect, not to do honour to the archbishop <lb/>
            of Canterbury, but to his learned master.— William of Malmesbury, Antiq. <lb/>
            Lib. p. 324. The French editor of Ordericus remarks, that the two other <lb/>
            bishops were not so well received, and had to defend themselves, the one <lb/>
            for being the son of a priest, the other for obtaining the bishopric of <lb/>
            Lincoln in recompence for the supplies he had furnished William towards <lb/>
            the conquest of England. (See vol. i. of this work, p. 465.) We find <lb/>
            nothing of this in the English historians we have consulted. Henry of <lb/>
            Huntingdon, who was a canon of Lincoln, gives a high character of Bishop <lb/>
            Remi. See his History, p. 220, and Letter to Warin, p. 304 of Bohn's <lb/>

            the accomplishment of his most ardent earthly hopes, was no <lb/>
            longer for this world. He had retired from military service <lb/>
            in the year of OUT Lord 103A, and changing his course of <lb/>
            life received the religious habit from the Lord Herbert, <lb/>
            bishop of Lisieux. Three years afterwards he was ordained <lb/>
            by the same bishop and appointed abbot. It was then that <lb/>
            the abbey of Bee was first established. He died on the <lb/>
            seventh of- the calends of September [26th August], in <lb/>
            the year of our Lord 1078, being the eighty-fourth year of <lb/>
            his age, and the forty-fourth of his profession as a monk. <lb/>
            After an interval of a few days, Anselm, then prior of that <lb/>
            house, was elected abbot. The year following he was <lb/>
            consecrated abbot in the abbey church at Bee by the lord <lb/>
            Gislebert, bishop of Evreux, on the festival called "The <lb/>
            Chair of St. Peter." 1 He submitted to the monastic rule <lb/>
            when he was twenty-seven years old, and continued three <lb/>
            years in the cloister without being preferred to any office. <lb/>
            He then succeeded Lanfranc as prior, which rank he held <lb/>
            for fifteen years, and then, on the death of Herluin the first <lb/>
            abbot of Bee, was appointed to the government of the abbey <lb/>
            which he administered for another fifteen years. He was <lb/>
            afterwards raised to the archiepiscopal throne of Canterbury <lb/>
            on the demise of the venerable Lanfranc, and filled the see <lb/>
            for sixteen years, during which he was exposed to many <lb/>
            trials. He departed out of this life on the eleventh of the <lb/>
            calends of May [21st April], being the fourth day before <lb/>
            Holy Thursday, in the seventeenth year of his archiepiscopate, <lb/>

            things, therefore mixes the rough with the smooth, to retain <lb/>
            within safe bounds the fickle enterprises of mankind. For <lb/>
            while King William was much puffed up with worldly pomp, <lb/>
            and the people of Normandy abandoned themselves to every <lb/>
            sort of luxury, giving no thought to the punishment which <lb/>
            awaited their accumulated offences, a terrible thunder storm <lb/>
            burst over the sanctuary of the church of Lisieux, and the awful <lb/>
            crash struck down the people assembled on the pavement of <lb/>
            the cathedral church. It happened one morning on a Sun­ <lb/>
            day in the summer season, when the holy mysteries of the <lb/>
            mass were being celebrated, and a priest named Herbert was <lb/>
            standing, mitred,' at the altar, that there was suddenly a fear­ <lb/>
            ful flash of lightning, immediately followed by a tremendous <lb/>
            crash and the falling of athunderbolt. Striking the cross which <lb/>
            stood on the pinacle of the tower, it shattered and threw it <lb/>
            down, and descending from thence into the body of the <lb/>
            church it was attracted by the crucifix, from which it tore <lb/>
            off a hand and foot and drew the iron nails which attached <lb/>
            them to the cross in a most singular manner. A dark <lb/>
            cloud concealed all objects from the trembling congregation, <lb/>
            and the lightning shot flashes through all the church, killing <lb/>
            eight men and one woman. It burnt the beards and hair of <lb/>
            men and women, and gave forth a most offensive smell. <lb/>
            One woman, whose name was Mary, preserved her footing, <lb/>
            under great alarm, in a corner of the church, from whence <lb/>
            she beheld the whole crowd of people lying apparently <lb/>
            lifeless on the floor of the church, while she herself was <lb/>
            ready to faint.</p>
          <p>This occurred before the feast of the nativity of St. John <lb/>

            bishop, perceiving that his death was at hand, began carefully <lb/>
            to examine himself as the servant of God summoned to his <lb/>
            Master's presence, and prepared himself with great reve­ <lb/>
            rence to give an account of his stewardship. Purified by <lb/>
            confession and penance, washed with prayers and floods of <lb/>
            tears, and strengthened by the blessed communion of the <lb/>
            life-giving mysteries, he exhorted the clergy and laymen <lb/>
            who were assembled about him, and gave them absolution <lb/>
            and his blessing. As his end approached, he recollected <lb/>
            one thing which caused him especial regret, and in refe­ <lb/>
            rence to which he thus implored all who were present: " I <lb/>
            know that I am now going the way of all flesh, but it <lb/>
            troubles me to think that I die at a distance from my see, <lb/>
            away from that spouse to which by God's ordinance 1 have <lb/>
            been lawfully united for almost forty years. I therefore <lb/>
            entreat all you whom I have formerly loved, nourished, pro­ <lb/>
            moted, and raised to honour, that you carry me forth from <lb/>
            hence, and transport me to the spouse I have so dearly loved. <lb/>
            I have completed the church of St. Peter the apostle, which <lb/>
            my venerable predecessor Herbert1 began; I carefully em­ <lb/>
            bellished it, supplied it with clergy, and furnished it with <lb/>
            the sacred vessels and all other requisites for divine worship. <lb/>
            Humbly commending it to the protection of the Lord of <lb/>
            heaven, in its sacred bosom I wish to repose, and there wait <lb/>
            in faith the second advent of our Lord." At these words <lb/>
            all present immediately arose, and, placing the bishop on a <lb/>
            convenient hand-litter, they carried him from the village of <lb/>
            Pont l'Eveque to Lisieux, the clergy of the highest rank <lb/>
            and the most honourable among the laity bearing their <lb/>
            beloved father on their shoulders. But while they were <lb/>
            using their utmost efforts to reach the city as quickly as <lb/>

            leagues distant from Lisieux; a cross was erected in the <lb/>
            field near the road, where the bishop died, which is called <lb/>
            to this day the Bishop's Cross.1 His body was carried to <lb/>
            Lisieux, but the funeral was deferred for eight days in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of a dispute between the canons and nuns. For <lb/>
            the clergy wished to bury him in their cathedral, but the <lb/>
            nuns strongly remonstrated, saying: " Our father Hugh <lb/>
            built our abbey of Notre Dame; he assembled us here to <lb/>
            serve God,2 and brought us up in the fear of the Lord -with <lb/>
            the love of a father to his daughters; when death approached <lb/>
            he chose the church which he had founded for his burial <lb/>
            place ; cursed be he who should attempt to deprive us his <lb/>
            daughters of our father's remains."</p>
          <p>The case was brought before the king's court at Rouen, <lb/>
            and the question was argued on both sides, but the royal <lb/>
            decision was in favour of the weaker sex. Whereupon Wil­ <lb/>
            liam sent for Archbishop John, and commanded to hasten <lb/>
            with all speed to Lisieux, and honourably inter the bishop's <lb/>
            corpse in the chapel of St. Mary. But the archbishop, being <lb/>
            a harsh and haughty prelate, and having a dreadful enmity <lb/>
            to the deceased bishop lurking in his bosom, was much <lb/>
            incensed, and, treating the royal command with contempt, <lb/>
            refused to go and bury his fellow bishop. As he was <lb/>
            returning from the king's court, riding on his mule through <lb/>
            the city, speaking arrogantly about the present affair, he <note type="footnote"> 1 It is supposed that this interesting scene took place on a spot now <lb/>

            was seized with violent spasms, by the divine permission, <lb/>
            just as he approached his own house, and, falling to the <lb/>
            ground in the sight of the multitude, lost the use of his <lb/>
            speech for the two years he survived. Upon this, Gislebert, <lb/>
            bishop of Evreux, went to Lisieux, with a great concourse <lb/>
            of the faithful, and interred the bishop, as was becoming, in <lb/>
            the choir of the nuns, in the presence of Robert, Count <lb/>
            d'Eu, his brother. A suitable stone was laid over the grave <lb/>
            of this great bishop, and an epitaph in Adonic metre, which <lb/>
            consists of a dactyl and a spondee, was engraved in letters of <lb/>
            gold, on a brass plate, as follows: <lb/>
            Underneath lies Bishop HUGH, <lb/>
            Honoured lord of Lisieux : <lb/>
            Not more noble was his birth <lb/>
            Than the splendour of his worth. <lb/>
            Doubly gifted, he combined <lb/>
            Wit and sanctity of mind. <lb/>
            France's sceptre Philip sway'd, <lb/>
            England William's rule obey'd, <lb/>
            And the blazing lamp of day <lb/>
            On the verge of Leo' lay, <lb/>
            When the bishop pass'd away. <lb/>
            Heavenly mercy speed him well, <lb/>

          <p>Gislebert, surnamed Maminot, the king's physician and <lb/>
            chaplain, was chosen bishop of Lisieux, and consecrated <lb/>
            by Michael, bishop of Avranches, in the presence of the <lb/>
            lord archbishop John, who, as we have just said, had lost the <lb/>
            use of his speech. He was the son of Robert de Courbé­ <lb/>
            pine,2 a brave knight; and, filling the see twenty-three years, <lb/>
            managed ecclesiastical affairs with a strong hand. Though <lb/>
            deeply skilled in the art of medicine, after he became bishop <lb/>
            he was unable to cure himself. He was eminent for his <lb/>
            learning and eloquence, abounded in wealth and the luxuries <lb/>
            it procured, but was a slave to his own gratification and the <lb/>
            care of the flesh. Ease and leisure were his great objects, <lb/>
            and he indulged frequently in dice and other games of <lb/>
            hazard. Negligent and slothful in his ecclesiastical duties, <lb/>
            he was ready and active enough in hunting and hawking. <lb/>
            He therefore devoted his life to worldly exercises and <note type="footnote"> 1 The bishop died, as stated before, on the 17th of July. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Near Bernai. </note> <pb n="122"/>

            employments, and did not give them up till age com­ <lb/>
            pelled him. I could write more about him, but I <lb/>
            check my pen, because it was by him that I was <lb/>
            admitted to the order of subdeacon, with (as well as I can <lb/>
            recollect) three hundred others. But, as I have mentioned <lb/>
            some things that are not very creditable to him, it is but <lb/>
            right that I should record his merits and his doings which <lb/>
            are worthy of imitation. He gave alms freely to the poor, and <lb/>
            was distinguished for a stately sumptuousness and wise <lb/>
            liberality. In his judgments he keenly investigated the <lb/>
            truth, and was indefatigable in defending the right, dis­ <lb/>
            pensing justice freely to all who came for it. He treated <lb/>
            with gentleness offenders who humbly confessed their sins, <lb/>
            and judiciously gave wise and salutary counsel to true peni­ <lb/>
            tents. He performed the ceremony of conferring sacred <lb/>
            orders, and of consecrations, with care and devotion; but he <lb/>
            was inert and difficult to be roused to undertake them, nor <lb/>
            would he engage in these offices until he was compelled by <lb/>
            the united entreaties of numbers. The church of Lisieux <lb/>
            at that time numbered among its clergy some honourable <lb/>
            persons and eminent archdeacons and canons; such as <lb/>
            William de Glanville, dean and archdeacon, Richard de <lb/>
            Angerville, and William de Poitiers,1 archdeacons, Geoffrey <lb/>
            de Triqueville the treasurer, Turgis the chanter, and his son <lb/>
            Ralph, with many others who had been educated by Bishop <lb/>
            Hugh, and advanced to offices of dignity in the church. His <lb/>
            successor attached these persons to himself, and gave them <lb/>
            instructive lessons in the wide field of arithmetic, astronomy, <lb/>
            physics, and other profound sciences, receiving them as his <lb/>
            guests, and familiarly conversing with them at his entertain­ <lb/>

            from his own church to the cathedral, and enshrined in a <lb/>
            coffer of gold and silver, exquisitely enriched with precious <lb/>
            stones. He appointed his feast to be celebrated throughout <lb/>
            the diocese on the tenth of the calends of November (Octo­ <lb/>
            ber 23rd); and by a general decree ordered a solemn pro­ <lb/>
            cession to be made every year to the deposit of the body of <lb/>
            the holy bishop without the city, inviting almost all the <lb/>
            inhabitants of the diocese to be present by monitions and <lb/>
            the promise of absolution and benediction.2 Like a tender <lb/>
            father, this bishop was kind to the clergy and monks, and all <lb/>
            who were under his rule. He occupied himself continually <lb/>
            with psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, and celebrated <lb/>
            regularly the sacred mysteries. He was a stranger to deceit <lb/>
            and malice, seeking no one's injury, but succouring the <lb/>
            indigent as occasion required. He bad naturally a fine <lb/>
            voice, and was a skilful chanter; was deeply versed in <lb/>
            ecclesiastical law, and had a great command of clear and <lb/>
            expressive language in preaching the word of God to the <lb/>
            uninstructed. His patience and benevolence charmed all <lb/>
            who enjoyed his society, and he committed without jealousy <lb/>
            a large share of his official burdens to his deans and arch­ <lb/>

            established it at first; and let it be proclaimed afresh in every <lb/>
            diocese, with the penalties of excommunication. If any <lb/>
            contumaciously refuse to observe it, or shall in any manner <lb/>
            break it, let the bishops take cognizance of the offence, and <lb/>
            do justice according to what is already decreed. But if the <lb/>

            admonishes and gives his support to the bishops in strictly <lb/>
            enforcing the divine law.</p>

            having had the charge brought against him by the bishop's <lb/>
            officials, let him clear himself in the episcopal court. But <lb/>
            if one of his parishioners or liege lords before accused him, <lb/>
            let there be an adjournment till he can refer to the bishop; <lb/>
            and if he designs to clear himself, let him do it in the pre­ <lb/>

            nor admit any priest who is not fit.</p>
          <p>11. In cemeteries which belong to churches, whether in <lb/>
            cities, castles, or burghs, the bishops shall retain whatever <lb/>
            rights they had in the time of Count Robert, or with the <lb/>
            consent of King William.</p>
          <p>12. As for the cemeteries in the marches, if there be war, <lb/>
            and any persons come to dwell there while hostilities con­ <lb/>
            tinue, and making the sacred inclosure their habitation on <lb/>
            account of the war, the bishop shall amerce them in no fine <lb/>
            except such as they incurred before they took refuge in the <lb/>
            churchyard. When peace is restored, those who thus sought <lb/>
            an asylum during the war shall be compelled to depart, or <lb/>
            shall become subject to the bishop's jurisdiction. Those <lb/>
            however who had ancient dwellings in the cemeteries, shall <lb/>
            possess their former holdings without disturbance.</p>
          <p>13. The country churches shall preserve the same extent <lb/>
            of cemeteries which belonged to them in the time of Count <lb/>
            Robert, or up to the period of the present synod. The <lb/>
            bishops shall possess the same rights in those inclosures <lb/>
            which they had in the time of Count Robert, or now hold <lb/>
            with the consent of King William, unless they have given <lb/>
            any release for them with the king's permission.</p>
          <p>14. If after this council a new church is built within any <lb/>
            village, the bishop shall make a cemetery with the concur­ <lb/>
            rence of the lords of the soil and parishioners. But if a <lb/>
            new church is erected where there is no village, it shall have <lb/>
            five perches of land round it, allotted for a cemetery.</p>
          <p>15. If a church be granted to monks, the priest who. is <lb/>
            in possession of it shall enjoy whatever belonged to it before <lb/>
            it was given to the monks, and so much the more because <lb/>
            he is then connected with more holy men. On his death <lb/>
            or other avoidance, the abbot shall select a qualified <lb/>
            priest, and present him to the bishop, either in person or <lb/>
            by letters dimissory. If he is a fit person the bishop shall <lb/>
            institute him: but if the priest should wish to live with the <lb/>
            monks under their strict rule, let him see that the church <lb/>
            to which he has been instituted by episcopal licence, be <lb/>
            decently provided with vestments, books, and other things <lb/>
            necessary for divine service, according to its means. But if <pb n="128"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.V. CH. V. </note> <lb/>
            the priest has no desire to live with the monks, let the <lb/>
            abbot make him such allowance from the revenues of the <lb/>
            church as will enable him to live comfortably, and to per­ <lb/>
            form properly the service of the church. If the abbot <lb/>
            refuse, let him be duly compelled by the bishop. The <lb/>
            priest who has the cure is to be under the jurisdiction of <lb/>
            his bishop, and shall pay him the dues belonging to his see. <lb/>
            What remains, the abbot may take for the use of his <lb/>
            monastery; let the same rules be observed with respect to <lb/>
            churches held by canons.</p>
          <p>16. Profanation of churches and churchyards, as it has <lb/>
            been before decreed, and offences causing interruptions to <lb/>
            divine worship, shall be punished by fines inflicted by the <lb/>
            bishops. Assaults on the road to church shall be punished <lb/>
            in the same manner.</p>
          <p>17. Item. If any person shall pursue another in a rage <lb/>
            into the churchyard or church.</p>

            without the bishop's licence.</p>
          <p>19. If a clerk commits a robbery or rape, or strikes, <lb/>
            wounds, or kills any one, or engages in a duel, without the <lb/>
            bishop's license, or accepts a pledge of battle, or makes an <lb/>
            assault, or seizes anything unjustly, or is guilty of arson, <lb/>
            or any one in his service, or dwelling in the church­ <lb/>

          <p>21. Item. If a priest forfeits his ministry.</p>

            synod.</p>
          <p>23. Item. If any priest shall not pay the synod and <lb/>
            visitation fees at the appointed times.</p>
          <p>24. Item. If a clerk shall give up the tonsure.</p>
          <p>25. Item. If a monk or nun, not living under any rule, <lb/>
            put off the monastic dress.</p>
          <p>26. Item. If priests excommunicate any persons, except <lb/>
            for breaking the truce of God, and robbery without the <lb/>
            bishop's licence.</p>
          <p>27. If any stray cattle, commonly called waifs, come to <lb/>

          <p>This synod was held at a royal country-seat on the Seine, <lb/>

            still called Caux. This city, as we read in ancient <lb/>
            annals of the Romans, was besieged by Julius Cæsar, and <lb/>
            was destroyed on account of the obstinate defence made by <lb/>
            the warlike inhabitants. Having reduced the enemy in this <lb/>
            place to submit to his will, he was so struck with the <lb/>
            advantageous site, that he took the precaution of making it <lb/>
            a Roman garrison, and called it after his own name Julia <lb/>
            Bona, which the barbarians corrupted into the name it now <lb/>
            bears, of Lillebonne.1</p>

            junction with the Seine. It was called by its founders <lb/>
            Rodomus, signifying the house of the Romans,1 and became <lb/>
            the station of a Roman legion, to overawe and command the <lb/>
            provincials in the neighbourhood.</p>
          <p>The city of Rouen is populous, and enriched by commerce, <lb/>
            its busy port, and flowing rivers, and pleasant meadows, <lb/>
            making it a cheerful residence. It abounds in fruits and fish, <lb/>
            and is affluent in its supplies of all commodities, is <lb/>
            surrounded on all sides by woods and hills, is strongly <lb/>
            fortified by walls, trenches, and bulwarks, and its public and <lb/>
            private buildings, its houses and churches, make a fine <lb/>
            appearance. St. Nicaisius the bishop, was commissioned to <lb/>
            come to this city with his companions by St. Denys, in the <lb/>
            time of the Emperor Domitian,2 but on the road he was <lb/>
            arrested by Sisinnius Fescenninus, at a place called Scamnis,3 <lb/>
            and remaining constant in the faith of Christ was beheaded, <lb/>
            as well as Quirinus the priest, and Scuviculus the deacon, <lb/>
            on the fifth of the ides [11th] of October. Their bodies <lb/>
            were left by their persecutors to be devoured by birds of <lb/>
            prey, dogs, and wild beasts, but by command of the <lb/>
            Almighty God, angels preserved them untouched. The <lb/>
            heathen guards being withdrawn the night following, the <lb/>
            holy martyrs miraculously arose by God's help, and having <lb/>
            replaced their heads,4 crossed the river Epte by a ford <lb/>
            unknown to man, and reposed themselves on a pleasant islet <lb/>
            in that river. The place has been called, in memory of the <lb/>
            saints, from that day to the present Vani, that is the ford of <lb/>
            Nicaisius ;5 and there the Almighty conferred many good <lb/>

            <title type="sub">On. VII. Legends of St. Taurinus, the first bishop of Evreux.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AT that time the faith of Christ savingly possessed and <lb/>
            illuminated the city of the Evantici, that is to say of Evreux, <lb/>
            situated on the river Iton. For St. Taurinus was sent there <lb/>
            by the blessed' Dionysius, and by God's help wrought many <lb/>
            miracles, God being always with him and gloriously directing <lb/>
            all his works. For this he had chosen to undergo patiently <lb/>
            all the trials and sufferings of this present life; and leaving <lb/>
            at Rome Tarquinius Romanus his father, and Eutychia his <lb/>
            most pious mother, with many other friends and relations, <lb/>
            by order of Pope Clemens, the young exile penetrated into <lb/>
            Gaul with Dionysius the Greek. When the second <lb/>
            persecution raged furiously against the Christians, under <lb/>
            Domitian, this Dionysius, who was then bishop of Paris, <lb/>
            ordained his godson Taurinus, who was now forty years <lb/>
            old, bishop, and, predicting many things he would have <lb/>
            to suffer, sent him among the inhabitants of Evreux, in the <lb/>
            name of the Lord. As the man of God drew near the gates <lb/>
            of the city, a demon encountering him in three different <lb/>
            shapes, that of a bear, a lion, and a buffalo, endeavoured to <lb/>
            terrify the champion of Christ. But he stood firm in the <lb/>
            faith like an impregnable wall, and completing his journey <lb/>
            was hospitably entertained in the house of Lucius. On the <lb/>
            third day, while Taurinus was preaching to the people, and <lb/>
            the charm of the new faith gained him willing hearers, the <note type="footnote"> 1 Machario, Greek for blessed. The following legend is extracted from <lb/>
            that found in the Bollandists under 2nd of August. It is of the same <lb/>
            stamp as the other fabrications of the ninth or tenth centuries, when <lb/>
            all knowledge of the real facts was lost or corrupted, and it was sought to <lb/>
            supply them by fables very ill put together, and all servilely copied one <lb/>
            from another. Here we have the confusion before referred to between the <lb/>
            two St. Denys's, and the introduction of our old acquaintances, the magi­ <lb/>
            cians Cambyses and Zara, to do honour to the miraculous powers of St. <lb/>
            Taurinus. All that is known with truth, is that Taurinus first preached <lb/>
            Christianity in these parts among the Aulcrci, about the beginning of the <lb/>
            fifth century. </note> <lb/>

            devil in alarm began to torment Euphrasia, the daughter of <lb/>
            Lucius, and cast her into the fire. She immediately died, <lb/>
            but shortly afterwards Taurinus, praying, and commanding <lb/>
            her to arise, she was restored to life in the name of the Lord. <lb/>
            No signs of fire appeared about her. All who were <lb/>
            witnesses of this miracle were struck with fear and astonish­ <lb/>
            ment, and believed in Jesus Christ. On that same day one <lb/>
            hundred and twenty men were baptized, eight blind men <lb/>
            received sight, four dumb were cured, and many more were <lb/>
            healed of their various infirmities in the name of the Lord.</p>
          <p>Then Taurinus entered the temple of Diana, and compelled <lb/>
            Zabulon, by the power of God, to stand visible before all the <lb/>
            people, at which spectacle the heathen multitude was <lb/>
            greatly terrified. For he appeared to them in the shape of <lb/>
            an Ethiopian, black as soot, having a long beard, and <lb/>
            breathing out flames of fire from his mouth. Then there <lb/>
            came an angel of the Lord, shining like the sun, and in the <lb/>
            sight of all bound the demon's hands and carried him off. <lb/>
            On that day therefore, two thousand souls were baptized, <lb/>
            and all the sick were cured by divine interposition. <lb/>
            Deodatus, the brother of Euphrasia, seeing these things, <lb/>
            believed and was baptized, and being made a priest recorded <lb/>
            truly all that happened. Then Taurinus entered the <lb/>
            defiled temple of Diana, and, purifying it by exorcisms and <lb/>
            prayers, consecrated it as a Christian church in honour of St. <lb/>
            Mary, mother of God. He then proceeded to destroy the <lb/>
            idols every where around, and to dedicate churches to <lb/>
            Christ, visiting his whole diocese, making canonical <lb/>
            ordinations, and establishing hospitality every where.</p>
          <p>Satan, becoming envious at beholding so much good, in <lb/>
            his despair devised many schemes for injuring the man of <lb/>
            God, and roused against him numerous enemies. Two <lb/>
            magicians, Cambyses and Zara, priests of Diana, groaned at <lb/>
            seeing the people converted to God, and incited twenty of <lb/>
            their disciples to kill Taurinus. But as they drew near <lb/>
            to him, they were discovered at some distance by the man of <lb/>
            God, who, making the sign of the cross against them, <lb/>
            caused them to stand fixed on the spot. At his command, <lb/>
            the second time, they were set free, and, throwing them­ <lb/>
            selves at his feet, believed, and were baptized, in the name <lb/>
            of the holy and undivided Trinity. The magicians, finding <pb n="134"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V. CH. VI. </note> <lb/>
            that their devices could not prevail against the soldier of <lb/>
            Christ, stabbed themselves with their own knives.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Licinius the consul hearing of the fame of the <lb/>
            holy bishop, he caused him to be presented to him at his <lb/>
            villa of Gisai.1 While he was being conducted there, he <lb/>
            met a paralytic man, and his sister, who was blind, deaf, and <lb/>
            dumb. He forthwith blessed water, and sprinkled the sick, <lb/>
            who were immediately made sound. The executioners, <lb/>
            seeing this miracle, instantly believed on the Lord. The <lb/>
            bishop and the consul, having sharply disputed concerning <lb/>
            idolatry and divine worship, the consul flew into a rage, and <lb/>
            commanded the bishop to be stripped naked and scourged <lb/>
            with rods; but the holy man devoutly prayed to God, and <lb/>
            presently a voice was heard from heaven, comforting him. <lb/>
            The hands, also, of the executioners immediately withered; <lb/>
            but the wife of Licinius, interceding for the man of God, <lb/>
            the consul was so incensed, that he commanded her to be <lb/>
            tortured.</p>
          <p>While this was passing, a messenger arrived with the <lb/>
            intelligence that his son had fallen down a precipice as he <lb/>
            was hunting in the neighbourhood of the castle of Alercus,2 <lb/>
            and died on the spot, as well as his attendant. Licinius and <lb/>
            all his troops were thrown into the deepest sorrow at this <lb/>
            calamity, and by God's will he was compelled to implore <lb/>
            the aid of the man of God, whom he had begun to torture. <lb/>
            Then Taurinus, having prostrated himself in the church of <lb/>
            St. Mary and prayed, went with the people to the bodies <lb/>
            which were lying dead. There he poured forth devout sup­ <lb/>
            plications to God; and, having ended his prayers, took the <lb/>
            hand of his cousin 3 Marinus, and restored him to life in the <lb/>
            name of the Lord. Licinius, and his wife, and all his chief <lb/>
            men, seeing this, rejoiced greatly, and casting themselves at <lb/>
            the bishop's feet, begged to receive holy baptism. And that <lb/>
            day one thousand two hundred souls were baptized. <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably Gisai, between Broglie and La Barre, where ruins of Roman <lb/>

            represented to have made the discovery that the saint was his uncle. </note> <pb n="135"/>
            </p>
          <p>Then Marinus entreating for his follower, Taurinus <lb/>
            assented, and, approaching the body, invoked God, and <lb/>
            called to Paschasius, who was immediately restored to life <lb/>
            by the power of God. Both, on their recovery, told each <lb/>
            other what they had seen in the place of the departed. <lb/>
            Paschasius predicted to Marinus that he would die on the <lb/>
            day he put off his white robes of baptism,1 which came to <lb/>
            pass ; for Marinus, being seized with a slight fever, died on <lb/>
            the eighth day after he was baptized.</p>
          <p>By such miracles as these, Taurinus, the first bishop of <lb/>
            Evreux, became illustrious, and brought many thousands to <lb/>
            the knowledge of the truth and righteousness. At length <lb/>
            when Pope Sixtus filled the apostolic see, and Ælius <lb/>
            Hadrian was emperor, Taurinus, full of years and virtues, <lb/>
            received a call from heaven, on the third of the ides [11th] <lb/>
            of August, and the church in which the people were assem­ <lb/>
            bled was filled with a thick and odoriferous cloud. After <lb/>
            the space of an hour, the cloud was withdrawn, and the <lb/>
            bishop was seen sitting on his chair, with his hands stretched <lb/>
            out in the act of prayer, and his eyes lifted to heaven. <lb/>
            Deep grief fell on the people of the diocese for the loss of <lb/>
            their bishop ; and, at the command of an angel, who appeared <lb/>
            to them in the shape of a person of eminence, the man of <lb/>
            God was buried outside the city, about the distance of one­ <lb/>
            third of a mile on the west side. The place long remained <lb/>
            without any mark of respect, but now a chosen company of <lb/>
            monks have, by the grace of God, settled there, to carry on <lb/>
            their soul-saving warfare.2 An extraordinary thing hap­ <lb/>
            pened at the funeral of the venerable bishop. While he <lb/>
            was being laid in the grave in the usual manner, and the <lb/>
            people were making great lamentations, he raised himself in <lb/>
            the pit, as if he were alive, and said: " My little children, <lb/>
            why do ye so? Fear not: listen to a just one." And, <lb/>
            bending his head, he was again silent. Accordingly, as soon <lb/>
            as the servant of Christ was buried, an angel of the Lord <note type="footnote"> 1 According to primitive custom and the canons of the church, the white <lb/>
            garments of baptism were worn for eight days. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The place where the tomb of St. Taurinus stood, and where a <lb/>
            monastery was founded to his honour before the end of the seventh <lb/>
            century, is still shown. Though now within the modem city of St. Evreux, <lb/>
            it was at a little distance from the Roman town. </note> <pb n="136"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V. CH. VII. </note> <lb/>
            said to the people: "Depart quickly, lest ye be surrounded <lb/>
            by the enemy; this city shall be destroyed, but none of you <lb/>
            shall be injured. This place shall remain unknown for a <lb/>
            long time." The angel then vanished, and all that he had <lb/>
            foretold came to pass. For the tomb of the holy bishop <lb/>
            and the anniversary of his departure were long concealed, <lb/>
            but at length became gloriously known by a divine revela­ <lb/>
            tion.1 Some miracles are also daily wrought by him at <lb/>
            Evreux. For the demon which he expelled from the temple <lb/>
            of Diana still haunts the city, appearing in various shapes, <lb/>
            but hurting no one. The common people call it the Gob­ <lb/>
            lin,2 and assert that it is restrained to this day from injuring <lb/>
            mankind by the merits of St. Taurinus ; and that because it <lb/>
            obeyed his commands by breaking its own idols, it was not <lb/>
            forthwith cast into the pit, but undergoes its punishment in <lb/>
            the very place where it had reigned supreme, by witnessing <lb/>
            the salvation of those whom it had before insulted and <lb/>
            tormented.</p>
          <p>It is also said by the inhabitants, and it is true, that no <lb/>
            venomous animal can exist in Evreux. At one time the <lb/>
            rich soil, flooded by the waters of the river Iton, gave birth <lb/>
            to such numbers of vipers and snakes, that the city of <lb/>
            Evreux was full of reptiles of that kind. The citizens <lb/>
            complaining of this pest, St. Taurinus prayed to the Lord to <lb/>
            deliver them from the annoyance, and that no venomous <lb/>
            reptile should in future be suffered to live within the walls. <lb/>
            His prayers were heard. If by any accident an adder or a <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author's abridgment of the legend ends here; it is not known <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the time of the emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, <lb/>
            the infant Christianity of Gaul was crushed by the rage of <lb/>
            its adversaries, and our holy mother the church deeply hu­ <lb/>
            miliated for nearly one hundred and sixty years. History <lb/>
            does not distinctly inform us, what nation it was which into­ <lb/>
            lerably oppressed both Christians and idolaters, or whence it <lb/>
            came, nor under what prince or tyrant it vented its fury. <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Landulf, then a clerk, and afterwards bishop, of Evreux, discovered <lb/>
            the relics of St. Taurinus in the beginning of the seventh century, when <lb/>
            he built a chapel on the spot. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There are various accounts of the translation of the relics of at. <lb/>
            Taurinus. At the invasion of the Northmen they were taken to Lezoux <lb/>
            in Auvergne:afterwards, at the beginning of the tenth century, to Gigni in <lb/>
            Franche-Compté. It is not known when they were brought back to Nor­ <lb/>

            those also advanced by the cathedral of Chartres, which pretends to have <lb/>
            received them after the pillage of Evreux by Philip-Augustus in 1195, the <lb/>
            abbey of St. Taurinus possesses them, where they are preserved in an <lb/>
            exquisite reliquary of the thirteenth century, of which M. Le Provost has <lb/>
            published a description. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This pretended invasion of Gaul is altogether apocryphal, and was <lb/>

            However it clearly appears in the acts of many of the saints of <lb/>
            that period, that during the reign of the emperors above named <lb/>
            an army of savage barbarians ravaged Gaul. At that time <lb/>
            there were no kings in Gaul, but the emperors of Rome, from <lb/>
            the time of Julius Cæsar, had all the Cisalpine nations under <lb/>
            their dominion, appointing prefects and other magistrates in <lb/>
            the cities at their will.</p>
          <p>The word of God was almost forgotten in Neustria after <lb/>
            the death of the holy bishop Taurinus, until the times of <lb/>
            Diocletian and Maximian, by whom the tenth persecution <lb/>
            was carried on with diabolical fury, and raged more fiercely <lb/>
            and longer against the church of Christ than any before. <lb/>
            But He who promised to be ever with his people, wonderfully <lb/>
            comforted and delivered his spouse in the storms of her deep <lb/>
            tribulation, protecting and exalting her and making her <lb/>
            triumphantly glorious. Moreover, he will reward her with <lb/>
            an eternal crown in the presence of his Father in the <lb/>
            heavenly Jerusalem. Her, therefore, he so much loved, he <lb/>
            did not leave long destitute of illustrious teachers during <lb/>
            the fury of her persecutors.</p>
          <p>When the tenth persecution fatally harassed the Christians <lb/>
            for ten years, and innumerable multitudes of martyrs were <lb/>
            slain with every species of torture, ascending to heaven with <lb/>
            the glorious ornament of their precious blood, Quentin and <lb/>
            Lucian, Valerian, Rufinus and Eugenius, Mellon and Avi­ <lb/>
            cian, and many others of the clergy and nobility of Rome, <lb/>
            went forth, and were scattered throughout Gaul faithfully <lb/>
            preaching the word of God. Quentin came to Amiens, and <lb/>

            Alexandria, Eusebius at Vercelli, and Dionysius at Milan, <lb/>
            were bright stars of the church.</p>
          <p>4. " Eusebius, so gentle and so constant in the duties of a <lb/>
            bishop, sweetly displayed the flowers of his virtues." He <lb/>
            flourished twenty-five years, in the time of Popes Liberius <lb/>

            apostate, Jovian, and Valentinian.</p>

            He laboured for the good of the church for twenty years, in <lb/>

            Valentinian, Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian [II.] At that <lb/>
            time died Anthony, the most illustrious of the Egyptian <lb/>
            monks. Peter, an eminent orator, flourished at Saragossa: <lb/>
            Ambrose of Milan withstood the Arians, like an impregnable <lb/>
            wall. A council of one hundred and fifty fathers assembled <lb/>
            at Constantinople under Pope Damasus, against Macedonius <lb/>
            and Eunomius.</p>
          <p>6. " Peter, the ever watchful guardian and worthy <lb/>
            protector of his people, piously filled the see committed to <lb/>
            him." He governed it nineteen years, in the time of Popes <lb/>
            Siricius and Anastasius, under Theodosius and Arcadius. <lb/>
            Then Martin of Tours, Maurilius of Angers, Basil of <lb/>

            St. Jerom, the interpreter of the word of God, flourished.</p>
          <p>7. " Victricius, the brave victor and avenger of sin, taught <lb/>

            eleven years,1 in the time of Pope Innocent, under <lb/>
            Arcadius and Honorius. In his age, Donatus, bishop of <lb/>

            re-established the church of God, and reformed the people." <lb/>
            He flourished nine years, in the time of popes Zosimus, <lb/>
            Boniface, and Celestine, under Honorius and his son <lb/>
            Arcadius. It was then that a council of two hundred <lb/>
            bishops was held at Ephesus, of which Cyril of Alexandria <lb/>
            was president. Palladius, ordained a bishop by Pope <lb/>
            Celestine, was sent as the first missionary to convert the <lb/>
            Scots.</p>
          <p>9. "Evodus1 succeeded: he was gifted with a holy <lb/>
            eloquence, firm and irreproachable, prudent, pious, and <lb/>
            modest." He flourished eight years, in the times of popes <lb/>
            Celestine and Sixtus. Then the Gauls rebelled against the <lb/>
            Romans, in conjunction with the Franks, who sprung from <lb/>
            the race of the Trojans. These two nations joihtly2 elected <lb/>
            Pharamond the Frank, son of Duke Sunno to be their king. <lb/>
            Maximus, bishop of Tours, was much esteemed for the <lb/>
            eloquence of his sermons.</p>
          <p>10. " St. Silvester governed his see honourably, ruling it <lb/>
            justly, and prudently enriching it." He flourished ten <lb/>
            years, when Leo was pope, and Clodion and Meroveus were <lb/>
            kings of the Franks.</p>
          <p>11. " Bishop Malson, relying on his divine doctrines, was <lb/>
            a shepherd held in veneration by the people in every <lb/>
            quarter." He flourished nine years, under Martian and <lb/>
            Valentinian, at the time that Pope Leo held a council of six <lb/>
            hundred and thirty bishops at Chalcedon, against Eutyches <lb/>
            and Dioscorus. In his time, the Saxons and Angles, under <lb/>
            Hengist and Horsa, passed over into Britain in three long <lb/>
            ships, and entered into engagements with Vortigern against <lb/>
            the Picts. Then Germanus of Auxerre was greatly distin­ <lb/>

            bishop flourished eight years, while Childeric governed the <lb/>
            Gauls, and Leo the Romans. At this time Theodore, a <lb/>
            bishop of Syria, wrote his ecclesiastical history, from the end <lb/>
            of that of Eusebius to his own times, that is, to the reign of <lb/>
            Leo, in which he died.</p>
          <p>13. " Crescentius was careful of his flock, adorning them <lb/>
            with eminent virtues, and causing them to increase in <lb/>
            goodness." He flourished twenty-six years, in the time of <lb/>
            popes Hilary and Simplicius, and of Leo the emperor. <lb/>
            Then Childeric, son of Meroveus, was king of the Franks.</p>
          <p>14. " Godard flourished, a holy and benevolent pastor, <lb/>
            generous and constant, and shedding abundantly the light of <lb/>
            the word." He governed the church fifteen years, in the <lb/>
            times of popes Felix, Gelasius, Anastatius, and Symmachus, <lb/>
            under the Emperor Zeno, and he consecrated St. Leo bishop <lb/>
            of Coutances. At that time flourished Remi, bishop of <lb/>
            Rheims, and Solin of Chartres, and Vedast of Arras, who <lb/>
            baptized the Merovingian Clovis, king of the Franks, in <lb/>
            the year of our Lord 488.1 The third year afterwards, <lb/>
            Mamertus, archbishop of Vienna, instituted processional <lb/>
            litanies, on account of the calamities which threatened the <lb/>
            city, that is, the rogations before Ascension day. Victorius <lb/>
            composed his Easter cycle for 532 years by command of <lb/>
            Pope Hilary. Odoacer, king of the Goths, took Rome, <lb/>
            which their kings, Theodoric, Triaricus, and Theodoric <lb/>
            Walamer afterwards held. Hunneric the Arian, king of the <lb/>
            Vandals in Africa, expelled more than- three hundred and <lb/>
            thirty-six Catholic bishops, shut up their churches, and <lb/>
            persecuted the people with various punishments. Godard <lb/>
            of Rouen, and Médard of Soissons, had Nectard of Noyon <lb/>
            for their father and Protagia for their mother, and both <lb/>
            departed to the Lord on the sixth of the ides [8th] of <lb/>
            June.2 The illustrious Ouen composed these verses on <lb/>
            them :- <note type="footnote">1 The conversion of Clovis took place in 496, and not in 488, as the <lb/>

            Agapete, under the Emperors Anastatius, Justin the Elder, <lb/>
            and Justinian. After the death of Clovis, Sigismund,2 <lb/>
            Childebert, and his other sons succeeded. Clotaire, who <lb/>
            survived them all, was king of the Franks fifty-one years; <lb/>
            during whose reign, Laumer, Evroult, and other holy <lb/>
            men flourished in his kingdom. Thrasamond, king of the <lb/>
            Vandals, closed the Catholic churches, and banished two <lb/>
            hundred and twenty bishops to Sardinia, to whom Pope <lb/>
            Symmachus supplied food and clothing yearly. The <lb/>
            Emperor Anastatius, who favoured the Eutychian heresy, <lb/>
            was struck with lightning because he persecuted the <lb/>
            Catholics. In the time of Justin the Elder. Pope John gave <lb/>
            sight to a blind man at Constantinople, and on his return to <lb/>
            Ravenna was slain by Theodoric. The king of the Goths <lb/>
            also put to death Symmachus the patrician, and Boethius, <lb/>
            and he himself was cut off suddenly the year following. <lb/>
            Athalaric, his nephew, succeeded him. Hilderic, king of the <lb/>
            Vandals, recalled the bishops from exile, and commanded the <lb/>
            churches to be restored, after seventy-six years of <lb/>
            profanation by the heretics. Benedict, the abbot, was <lb/>
            illustrious for his virtues, respecting which Pope Gregory <lb/>
            wrote in his Book of Dialogues. Belisarius, the patrician, <lb/>
            being sent into Africa by Justinian, conquered the Vandals, <lb/>
            and sent their king Gelimer a prisoner to Constantinople. <lb/>
            Carthage was re-taken ninety-six years after its occupation <lb/>
            by the barbarians. Dionysius the Little wrote his Paschal <lb/>
            Cycle, beginning from the year of our Lord 532; and the <lb/>
            Justinian Code was promulgated the same year. Victor, <lb/>

            during forty-eight years, in the times of popes Agapetus, <lb/>
            Silverius, Vigelius, Pelagius, John, and Pelagius, under the <lb/>
            Emperors Justin and Tiberius Constantine. In Italy, the <lb/>

            Gregory the Great, under Maurice, the first Greek emperor <lb/>

            Heracleon, son of Heraclius, and the three Constantines, <lb/>
            were emperors, living long and well, labouring earnestly, <lb/>

            power of relating with what grandeur and sanctity, with <lb/>
            what excellence of every kind his life was distinguished. <lb/>
            Pope Martin held a council of one hundred and five bishops <lb/>
            at Rome. He was afterwards carried off by the exarch <lb/>
            Theodore, at the command of Constantine, nephew of He­ <lb/>
            raclius, and being banished to the Chersonesus, died there <lb/>
            in the odour of sanctity. Archbishop Theodore and abbot <lb/>
            Adrian being sent into Britain by Pope Vitalian, enriched <lb/>
            many of the English churches with the fruits of their doc­ <lb/>
            trine. From the time that Pope Gregory sent the mission­ <lb/>

            following bishops presided over the see of Canterbury; <lb/>
            Augustine, Lawrence, Mellitus of London, Justus of Ro­ <lb/>
            chester, Honorius, and Deusdedit; they brought to the <lb/>
            faith of Christ the following kings of Kent, with their sub­ <lb/>
            jects ; Ethelbert, Eadbald, Ercombert, and Egbert. Vigard1 <lb/>
            was chosen the seventh archbishop by the kings Oswy and <lb/>
            Egbert, and sent to Rome to receive consecration. He died <lb/>
            there while he was waiting for the day appointed for the <lb/>

            St. Aicadre, who was removed from the abbey of Noirmou­ <lb/>

            assistance of the venerable Archbishop Owen, as the zealous <lb/>
            reader will find clearly in the accounts of their acts. In <lb/>
            Italy, on the death of Aribert at Pavia, after a reign of nine <lb/>
            years, he was succeeded by his two sons, who were yet very <lb/>
            young; Godebert fixing his seat of government at Pavia, <lb/>
            and Bertarith at Milan. A short time afterwards Grimo­ <lb/>
            aId, the powerful duke of Beneventum, slew Godebert and <lb/>
            drove out Bertarith, and obtained their throne, with their <lb/>
            sister's hand, reigning securely and prosperously nine years. <lb/>
            On his death, Bertarith reigned eighteen years, associating <lb/>
            in his government Cunipert his son by the Queen Rode­ <lb/>
            linda. Both were lovers of justice, devoted to God and his <lb/>
            church, and protectors of the poor. Alacheris, duke of <lb/>
            Brescia, rebelled against them, and kept the whole province <lb/>
            in alarm by frequent incursions, until they were put an end <lb/>
            to by his death in battle with Cunipert. Pope Agatho, at <lb/>
            the request of the most pious emperors Constantine, He­ <lb/>
            radius, and Tiberius, sent John, bishop of Ostia, John the <lb/>
            deacon, and other legates of the holy Roman church, to <lb/>
            Constantinople; and held there, under their presidency, a <lb/>
            council of one hundred and fifty bishops against George, <lb/>
            bishop of the imperial city, Macharius, bishop of Antioch, <lb/>
            and other heretics. At the termination of the controversy <lb/>
            George stood corrected, but Macharius and his confederates <lb/>
            were condemned.</p>
          <p>21. " The illustrious Ansbert, arriving at the highest <lb/>
            pitch of merit, well governed the church which his sanctity <lb/>
            ennobled." He held the see eighteen years,1 in the time of <lb/>
            popes Leo, Benedict, John, Con on, and Sergius, under the <lb/>
            emperors Constantine and Justinian the younger: then <lb/>
            Lothaire, Theodoric, and Hilderic, were kings; and Leo­ <lb/>

            sor in the sacred order, a prelate of great merit, and a <lb/>
            venerable pastor." He flourished during twenty-four years, <lb/>
            in the time of popes John, Sisinnius, Constantine, and <lb/>
            Gregory. Leo, Tiberius, Justinian, Philippicus, Anastasius, <lb/>

            Dagobert the younger, were kings of the Franks. In <lb/>
            Britain, the life of the most reverend Cuthbert, who, from <lb/>
            a hermit became a bishop, was illustrious for miracles from <lb/>
            infancy to age.1 His body was found undecayed by Ralph, <lb/>
            bishop of Rochester, in the time of Henry, king of England, <lb/>
            and his vestments were changed in the presence of Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, king of the Scots, who stood reverently by with the <lb/>
            clergy and monks.</p>
          <p>23. " Radiland2 threw lustre on his order by his justice, <lb/>
            his compassion for all, and his surpassing merits." He held <lb/>
            the see three years in the time of Pope Gregory, when Leo <lb/>
            was emperor. On the death of Dagobert, the Franks raised <lb/>
            Daniel, a clerk to the throne. The Saracens besieged Con­ <lb/>
            stantinople with an immense army for three years; but <lb/>
            although the citizens resisted more with prayers than with <lb/>
            arms, they were defeated, and drew off, their numbers <lb/>
            thinned with famine, cold, and pestilence. Liutprand, <lb/>
            king of the Lombards, at the instance of Pope Gregory, <lb/>
            confirmed the donation of the patrimony of the church in <lb/>
            the Cottian Alps, which Aripert had sent to Rome in let­ <lb/>
            ters of gold, and he had renewed. He also redeemed the <lb/>
            relics of St. Augustine, the doctor, at a vast expense, and <lb/>
            translated them from Sardinia, which the Saracens had pro­ <lb/>
            faned and devastated, to Pavia, where they were honourably <lb/>
            interred.</p>
          <p>24. " The venerable Hugh3 was a great benefactor to the <lb/>
            Lord's people, and set before his flock the doctrines of a <lb/>
            holy life." He was cousin of Pepin, prince of the Franks, <lb/>
            and was archbishop eight years in the time of Pope Gregory <lb/>
            II. He had also presided over the churches of Paris and <lb/>

            to this day with honour in a silver shrine, at a place called <lb/>
            Aspes, in the territory of Cambray. Constantine was then <lb/>
            emperor. The Englishman Bede, a servant of Christ, and <lb/>
            a priest of the monastery of the holy apostles, SS. Peter and <lb/>
            Paul, at Wearmouth, near Jarrow, now flourished. He was <lb/>
            born on the domains of that monastery, and when seven <lb/>
            years old was entrusted by his relations to the most re­ <lb/>
            verend abbot Benedict, and afterwards to Ceolfrid, for <lb/>
            education; and spent his whole life as an inhabitant of that <lb/>
            monastery, giving himself up to meditation on the holy <lb/>
            scriptures; but, besides his observance of the regular dis­ <lb/>
            cipline, and his daily duty of chanting in the choirs, he <lb/>
            found pleasure, as he tells us himself, in always having <lb/>
            something either to learn, or to teach, or to write. In his <lb/>
            nineteenth year he received the order of deacon, and in his <lb/>
            thirtieth that of priest, at the hands of the most reverend <lb/>
            Bishop John, in submission to the directions of his Abbot <lb/>
            Ceolfrid, on both occasions. Even after he was admitted to <lb/>
            the priesthood, he never relinquished his useful studies till <lb/>
            the fifty-ninth year of his life, but made many short com­ <lb/>
            mentaries on the holy scriptures, from the writings of the <lb/>
            venerable fathers, and took care to add them to the text to <lb/>
            explain and interpret it. The fruits of his labours and <lb/>
            studies were most valuable to the church of Christ; for he <lb/>
            composed seventy-two books on the law of God and the <lb/>
            inquiries connected with it, all which he exactly enumerates <lb/>
            and describes at the end of his English History.1 At the <lb/>
            same time Paul, a monk of Monte-Cassino, flourished in <lb/>

            Elides, he gave battle to the Saracens in Aquitaine, where <lb/>
            three hundred and twenty-five thousand fell.1 He also gave <lb/>

            the divine law." He held the see of Rouen four years in <lb/>
            the time of Pope Gregory III. In England, on the death <lb/>
            of Bertwald, archbishop of Canterbury, he was succeeded by <lb/>
            Tatwine. At that time two English kings, Coenred king of <lb/>

            he governed the church of Rouen seventeen years1 in the <lb/>
            time of popes Paul, Constantine, and Stephen. The em­ <lb/>
            peror Constantine, son of Leo, assembled at Constantinople <lb/>
            a council of three hundred and thirty bishops. Pope <lb/>
            Stephen, harassed by the persecutions of Astolphus, king of <lb/>
            the Lombards, repaired to France and consecrated King <lb/>
            Pepin and his sons Charles and Charlemagne. At that <lb/>
            time Boniface, archbishop of Mayence, and Gray, abbot of <lb/>
            Fontenelles, flourished. Constantine, and Abdallas emir, <lb/>
            king of the Saracens, rivalled each other in persecuting the <lb/>
            orthodox. Leo the son of Constantine, the seventy-first <lb/>
            emperor from Augustus, reigned five years. King Pepin <lb/>
            died the eighth of the calends of October [24th September], <lb/>
            in the year of our Lord 768, and was succeeded by his son <lb/>

          <p>29. " Bishop Meginhard, full of the odour of sanctity, <lb/>
            taught his flock and purified them from the foulness of sin." <lb/>
            He flourished in the time of Pope Adrian for eight years.2 <lb/>
            Charles undertook an expedition to Rome in the sixth year of <lb/>
            his reign ; on his return he took Pavia, and making prisoner <lb/>
            Desiderius king of the Lombards, who had grievouly <lb/>
            harassed Pope Adrian, he led him captive to France, and <lb/>
            expelled his son Adolgiso out of Italy. This Desiderius <lb/>
            was the thirty-first king of the Lombards. On account of <lb/>
            his crimes, the royal dignity ended with him, and the Lom­ <lb/>

            Hildehoc and Godehoc, Cleplio and Tato, Wacho, Waltarith, <lb/>
            Audoin, and Alboin. Agelmund led the Lombards into <lb/>

            of the patrician Narses, into Italy. King Alboin was killed <lb/>

            mother Theodelind, governed the Lombards for ten years, <lb/>
            and was succeeded by Rotharith, a brave king, but infected <lb/>
            with the corruptions of the Arian. heresy. After reigning <lb/>
            sixteen years, he abdicated in favour of his son Rodoald, <lb/>
            who, five years [months ?] afterwards, being surprised in <lb/>
            adultery, was killed by his Lombard rival. Aripert, son of <lb/>
            Gondoald and nephew of Queen Theodelind, succeeded, <lb/>
            and after a reign of nine years left the kingdom to his sons <lb/>
            Bertharith and Godibert. Meanwhile Grimoald, duke of <lb/>
            Beneventum, had married Rodelind, daughter of King Ari­ <lb/>
            pert, and got rid of her brothers,—Godibert, by putting him <lb/>
            to death, and Bertharith, by driving him out of the king­ <lb/>
            dom. On his death, nine years afterwards, Bertharith <lb/>
            recovered his throne, having ejected Garibald, the son of <lb/>
            Grimoald, who had occupied it three months. Bertharith. <lb/>
            reigned eighteen years, and after him Cunipert twelve years; <lb/>
            on whose death the Lombards had four kings in two years; <lb/>
            viz., Liutpert, son of Cunipert, Raginpert, son of Godibert <lb/>
            and duke of Turin, Aripert his son, and Rotharith, duke of <lb/>
            Bergamo. In the end, Aripert, being the most powerful, <lb/>
            slew Liutpert and Rotharith ; he expelled Ansprand, Liut­ <lb/>
            pert's guardian, from the island of Comacine,1 and put out <note type="footnote"> reigns of Augustus and Trajan. The assertion of their Scandinavian origin <lb/>

            years, and granting to St. Peter more than his predecessors <lb/>
            had wrested from the apostolic see. At last, while swim­ <lb/>
            ming in the Po, he sunk from the weight of gold he had <lb/>
            about him, and was drowned. Ansprand, though a sagacious <lb/>
            prince, reigned only three months, but Liutprand, his bold <lb/>
            soil, maintained himself on the throne nearly thirty-two <lb/>
            years. His nephew Hildebrand, who succeeded him, died <lb/>
            two years afterwards. Then Ratchis and Astolphus, sons of <lb/>
            Penmon duke of Friuli, seized the crown, but the first- <lb/>
            named voluntarily abdicated and became a monk at Rome. <lb/>
            Astolphus harassed the church in various ways while Stephen <lb/>
            was pope, but at last, by the judgment of God, was pierced <lb/>
            by an arrow while he was hunting. Finally, Duke Desi­ <lb/>
            derius was made king of the Lombards by the aid of Pope <lb/>
            Stephen, but having secured the crown, he commenced hos­ <lb/>
            tilities against the pope and clergy and people of Rome. <lb/>
            This made it necessary for Pope Adrian to invite the help of <lb/>
            the Franks, who crushed, and to this day have trodden down, <lb/>
            the fierce power of the Lombards. This took place in the <lb/>
            time of Mainard, bishop of Rouen, in the year of our Lord <lb/>
            774.</p>
          <p>30. "Bishop Willebert1 succeeded; he was firm but gentle, <lb/>
            and the faithful shepherd of his flock." He held the see <lb/>
            forty-eight years in the times of popes Adrian, Leo, Stephen, <lb/>
            and Paschal, while Contantine, Leo, Nicephorus, and his <lb/>
            son Stauracius, Michael, Leo (the Armenian), and Michael, <lb/>
            were emperors of Constantinople. Charles, king of the <lb/>
            Franks, rose to the summit of power, and extended his <lb/>
            dominion surprisingly over all his neighbours. He razed <lb/>
            the walls of Pampeluna, took Saragossa by siege, reduced to <lb/>
            submission Gascony, Spain, and Saxony, and ravaged the <lb/>
            territories of the Bavarians, the Sclaves, who are called <lb/>
            Wiltzes, and the Huns. In the time of Constantine and <lb/>
            his mother Irene, a stone coffin was found at Constantinople <lb/>
            with a man's body lying in it, and which had this inscription, <lb/>
            " Christ shall be born of the Virgin Mary, and I believe in <lb/>

            thou shalt see me again."1 In the time of Pope Leo, there <lb/>
            was a great earthquake which shook almost all Italy, and <lb/>
            threw down great part of the roof and timber work of St. <lb/>
            Paul's. In the year of our Lord 800, the eighth indiction, <lb/>
            King Charles received the imperial crown from Pope Leo, <lb/>
            and was received by the Roman people with acclamations of <lb/>
            Augustus. At the time of Charles's death hisreign had <lb/>
            lasted forty-seven years ; he was succeeded by his own son <lb/>
            Lewis, who reigned twenty-seven years. Archbishop Guille­ <lb/>
            bert was of his privy council.</p>
          <p>31. " Rainoward,* happily, came next in order: he fostered <lb/>
            the meek, and kept the rebellious in subjection." He held <lb/>
            the see ten years in the times of popes Eugenius, Valentine, <lb/>
            and Gregory IV., under the emperor Theophilus. In his <lb/>
            time there were great troubles in France arising out of the <lb/>
            rebellion of Lothaire against his father Lewis the Pious. The <lb/>
            Northmen also began to ravage Britain and other countries. <lb/>
            In consequence the body of St. Philibert was translated <lb/>
            from the island of Noirmoutier.3</p>
          <p>32. " Gumbald4 pursued the even tenor of a just life, <lb/>
            regarding his people with the feeling of a venerable pastor." <lb/>
            This bishop governed the see of Rouen eleven years in the <lb/>
            times of popes Gregory and Sergius, and during the reigns <lb/>
            of the emperors Michael and his son Theophilus. The em­ <lb/>
            peror Lewis died on the twelfth of the calends of July [20th <lb/>
            June], 840; and Archbishop Drogo, his brother, caused his <lb/>
            body to be carried to Metz for interment. The empire was <lb/>
            divided between Lewis's three sons, Lewis, Lothaire, and <lb/>
            Charles the Bald, but not without hostilities, for a bloody <lb/>
            battle was fought near Auxerre on the seventh of the calends <lb/>
            of July [25th June], in which Christian nations put each <lb/>
            other to the sword without mercy. The relics of St. Ouen were <lb/>
            removed at the time the Northmen ravaged Rouen and burnt <lb/>
            his monastery, on the ides [15th] of May.</p>

            see six years, in the time of Pope Sergius and the emperor <lb/>
            Michael. Lothaire retained that part of France which his <lb/>
            father had allotted to him, with the title of king, which is <lb/>
            now called Lorraine, that is the realm of Lothaire. Charles <lb/>
            the Bald, a pious and powerful prince, was king of the <lb/>

          <p>34 " Wanilo,1 a wise prelate, deeply versed in sacred learn­ <lb/>

            flourished eleven years in the times of popes Leo, Benedict, <lb/>
            and Nicholas. In the fifth year of his episcopate, there was <lb/>
            hard frost from the day before the calends of December to <lb/>
            the nones of April [30th November—5th April].</p>
          <p>35. " Adelard,2 remarkable for the natural goodness of his <lb/>
            disposition, religiously defended the rights of the highest <lb/>
            order of the clergy." He held the see three years in the <lb/>
            time of Pope Nicholas. Basil killed his master Michael at <lb/>
            Constantinople, and reigned in his stead twenty years. <lb/>
            A severe famine, and mortality, with a murrain among the <lb/>
            cattle, raged throughout the world for three years.</p>
          <p>36. "Riculfus,3 the fortunate and good, sprung from a <lb/>
            noble stock, added large domains to the territories of the <lb/>
            church." He held the see three years, in the times of popes <lb/>
            Nicholas and Adrian.</p>
          <p>37. " "John,4 by divine right, an eminent bishop, shone <lb/>
            brightly in the ranks of his order by the light of his virtues." <lb/>
            He was archbishop of Rouen two years.</p>
          <p>38. " Witto,5 ascending the pontifical throne, became <lb/>
            eminent for his prudence and holy doctrine." He held <lb/>

          <p>39. " Franco6 succeeded; the kind protector of the people, <lb/>

            Adrian, and Stephen. Then Leo and Alexander, the sons of <lb/>
            Basil, reigned twenty-two years. In the year of our Lord <lb/>
            876, Rollo and his followers invaded Neustria, and for thirty <lb/>
            years afterwards ravaged France with fire, sword, and rapine. <lb/>
            He fought against Richard, duke of Burgundy, and Ebblis of <lb/>
            Poitou, with other French princes, and puffed up with his re­ <lb/>
            peated triumphs, grievously harassed the Christians. At last <lb/>
            Charles the Simple, son of Lewis Faineant,1 no longer able to <lb/>
            resist Rollo, came to terms with him, giving him his daughter <lb/>
            Grisla in marriage, and ceding Nenstria. At that time Alex­ <lb/>
            ander and Constantine, with their mother Zoe, and Romanus <lb/>
            the Armenian, were emperors at Constantinople.</p>
          <p>40. " Gunhard,2 next filled the episcopal seat; rendering <lb/>
            great services to the people, and prudently conciliating." <lb/>
            He' held the see with distinction twenty-three years, in the <lb/>
            time of the emperors Romanus, the Armenian, and Constan­ <lb/>
            tine. Duke Robert now usurped the crown of France; the <lb/>
            same year King Charles attacked and killed the traitor, but <lb/>
            in the end Hugh, son of the deceased duke, prevailed. Soon <lb/>
            afterwards Herbert, count de Peronne, brother-in-law of <lb/>
            Hugh the Great, got possession of the king's person by a <lb/>
            stratagem, and kept him in prison till he died, three years <lb/>
            afterwards. Lewis, the king's son, with his mother Edgiva, <lb/>
            took refuge in England with Athelstan his uncle, son of King <lb/>
            Edward the Elder; and Rodolph, the illustrious son of <lb/>
            Richard, duke of Burgundy, and Charles's nephew, usurped <lb/>
            the throne seven years. On his death William Long-sword, <lb/>
            duke of Normandy, was moved by the entreaties of the <lb/>
            French to invite Lewis to return from England, and restored <lb/>
            him to his father's throne as the lawful heir.4 Agapete, <lb/>
            Basil, Stephen, Formosus, John, and Stephen filled the <lb/>
            apostolic see. William, the son of Rollo, restored the abbey <lb/>

            firmness twenty-five years, and reduced his enemies and <lb/>
            neighbours either by force or policy, was murdered by Arnulf, <lb/>
            count of Flanders, on an island in the Somme, where he un­ <lb/>
            suspectingly went to a conference with him on the fifteenth <lb/>
            of the calends [15th] of January. Richard his son, sur­ <lb/>
            named Sprotiades, who was then only ten years old, succeeded <lb/>
            to the dukedom. Duke William and Gunhard, archbishop <lb/>
            of Rouen, both died in the year of our Lord 942, when <lb/>
            Louis d'Outremer was king of France.</p>
          <p>41. " Hugh1 succeeded Gunhard; a violator of the law of <lb/>
            God, a prelate of illustrious birth, but who failed to be <lb/>
            illuminated by the light of Christ." He held the bishopric <lb/>
            forty-seven years, but is not spoken of in terms of praise by <lb/>
            any of the writers who have given accounts of him and his <note type="footnote"> by the intervention of his sister Gerloc, countess of Perth. M. Le Prévost <lb/>
            remarks that nothing short of this could have induced monks to go and <lb/>
            settle in the middle of brigands, such as the Normans were at this time. <lb/>
            He says with respect to William's personal intentions: "Our historians <lb/>
            represent him as aspiring to the monastic life for himself. If one may <lb/>
            believe them, it was with the greatest reluctance he submitted to the delay <lb/>
            enjoined him by Abbot Martin, who had more sense than his prince, and <lb/>
            was not to be satisfied till he had extorted from him a gown and a cowl, <lb/>
            which he carefully enclosed in a chest, the silver key of which he always <lb/>
            carried hanging by a string to his neck. Unfortunately, the impartial <lb/>
            Frodoard gives a flat refutation to all these monkish tales, by describing <lb/>
            William as engaged that year more than ever in warlike enterprises, and <lb/>
            heading an expedition against Rheims. Another historian, in reference to <lb/>
            events which occurred in 940, calls him the most ferocious duke of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy. The monk Richer, who often brings him on the scene, can find no <lb/>
            other description so fitting for him as that of ' Prince of the Pirates,' and <lb/>
            exhibits him as not having the slightest disposition to the abnegation and <lb/>
            gentleness of the monastic life." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 It was towards the end of 942, and consequently a year before his own <lb/>
            tragic end, that William Long-sword summoned Hugh from the abbey of <lb/>
            St. Denys to raise him to the see of Rouen. It would have been difficult <lb/>
            at that time to have made a more promising selection, but the bishop <lb/>
            disappointed all the expectations formed respecting him. He completely <lb/>
            abandoned the monastic life to give himself up to the pomps of the world <lb/>
            and the works of the flesh, having a numerous offspring, and alienating the <lb/>
            domains of his church. Among others, he gave Toöeni to his brother <lb/>
            Ralph, who thus became founder of the family of the lords of Toöeni and <lb/>
            Conches, and of Stafford in England. </note> <lb/>

            predecessors. Indeed, they plainly intimate that he was a <lb/>
            monk by his habit only, and not by his conduct. In his <lb/>
            time, Marinus, Agapete, Octavian, Leo, Benedict, and John, <lb/>
            filled the apostolical see; and the kingdoms of the world <lb/>
            were agitated by great revolutions. King Lewis got <lb/>
            possession of Rouen, and, taking Richard the duke captive <lb/>
            by surprise, brought him to Laon, and there threw him into <lb/>
            prison; but by God's providence and the prudence of <lb/>
            Osmond, his guardian, he made his escape. Then Harold, <lb/>
            king of Denmark, at the instance of Bernard, the Dane, <lb/>
            landed in Normandy at the head of an army to punish King <lb/>
            Lewis for the murder of William Long-sword. A battle <lb/>
            was fought on the river Dive, in which Herluin, count of <lb/>
            Montreuil, with his brother Lambert, and sixteen other <lb/>
            French counts were slain, and Lewis was taken prisoner and <lb/>
            sent captive to the tower of Rouen. Gerberg, queen of <lb/>
            France, who was daughter of Henry, the Trans-Rhenish <lb/>
            emperor, made peace with the Normans, by the advice of <lb/>
            Hugh the Great, giving as hostages for the observance of the <lb/>
            treaty her son Lothaire and two bishops, Hilderic of <lb/>
            Beauvais, and Guy of Soissons. In consequence, the king <lb/>
            was set at liberty, and the Count Richard, the father of his <lb/>
            country, was established in power.1 The emperor Otho <lb/>
            over-ran Italy; Stephen and Constantine, the sons of <lb/>
            Romanus, deposed their father Romanus from the throne of <lb/>
            Constantinople, but Constantine expelled them in turn, and, <lb/>
            having associated his son Romanus in the government, they <lb/>
            reigned sixteen years, and were succeeded by the Emperor <lb/>
            Nicephorus. Ludolf, son of King Otho, died, after having <lb/>
            subdued Italy, and Otho, an infant, was raised to the <lb/>

            murdered by his wife, was succeeded by John, whose niece <lb/>

            exertions, seconded by the favour and assistance of King <lb/>

            He was the last of the race of Charlemagne who sat on the <lb/>

            Lothaire were placed in confinement, and Hugh the Great, <lb/>
            son of Hugh the Great, was elected king.</p>
          <p>42. " Robert, an eminent prelate, of most illustrious <lb/>
            origin, after governing happily, ended his days devoutly." <lb/>
            He was son of Duke Richard the Elder by Gunnor, and <lb/>
            was for forty-eight years archbishop of Rouen and count of <lb/>
            Evreux, in the time of Robert, king of France, and his son <lb/>
            Henry. During that period Agapete and Silvester <lb/>
            [Gerbert], John and Benedict, and another John and <lb/>
            Benedict, filled the see of Rome. Otho, Henry, and <lb/>
            Conrad, were emperors in lawful succession. Archbishop <lb/>
            Robert was amply endowed with the goods of this world, <lb/>
            and took a deep interest in the secular affairs of his city, nor <lb/>
            did he observe the continence which was becoming his order.1 <lb/>
            For, in his character of count, he took a wife named <lb/>
            Harleve, by whom he had three sons, Richard, Ralph, and <lb/>
            William, to whom he bequeathed his county of Evreux, and <lb/>
            his other ample honours and possessions, according to the <lb/>
            secular laws. But, as he advanced in years, he became <lb/>
            sensible of his errors, and repenting of them was struck <lb/>
            with alarm at his many and great offences. He therefore <lb/>
            distributed alms largely to the poor, and began to rebuild <lb/>
            from the foundations the cathedral church of Rouen, <lb/>
            dedicated to the holy mother of God; and he completed a <lb/>
            considerable part of the new erection.2 Richard II., duke <lb/>
            of Normandy, governed the province thirty years with <lb/>
            signal success. He was a great friend to the poor in <lb/>
            Christ, the clergy and monks, treating them as a father, and <lb/>
            augmented and protected three monasteries which his <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert was archbishop of Rouen from 939 or.990—1137. He was <lb/>
            also count of Evreux. Our author's suggestion that it was in that character <lb/>

            suburbs of Rouen, and St. Michael-in-peril-of-the-Sea.1 He <lb/>
            also restored the abbey of Fontenelles,2 and ratified by his <lb/>
            charter all the endowments made in its favour by Turstin, <lb/>
            and Gerard Fleitel, and other barons. At his death he <lb/>
            bequeathed his dominions to his sons Richard the younger <lb/>
            and Robert, who did not enjoy their honours more than nine <lb/>
            years. For Richard III. was taken off by poison before two <lb/>
            years were over, and after seven years and a half, his <lb/>
            brother Robert undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. On <lb/>
            quitting his country never to return, he left the dukedom to <lb/>
            his son William, a boy eight years old, appointing his <lb/>
            cousin Alan count of Brittany to be his guardian.3 At <lb/>
            this time, Alfred and Edward, the young English princes, <lb/>
            became exiles in Normandy; for Richard II. had given his <lb/>
            sister in marriage to Ethelred king of England, who had <lb/>
            by her Alfred, and Edward, who was afterwards king. That <lb/>
            princess after her husband's death sent her sons to <lb/>
            Normandy, and married Canute king of Denmark, to whom <lb/>
            she bore Hardicanute, king of Denmark and England, and <lb/>
            Gunilde who was married to Henry, emperor of the <lb/>
            Romans.4 <note type="footnote"> 1 Richard 1. settled regular canons in the ancient convent of nuns at <lb/>

          <p>In the year of our Lord 1063, in the month of October, in <lb/>
            the second indiction, Archbishop Mauritius consecrated with <lb/>
            great ceremony the metropolitan church of St. Mary, mother <lb/>
            of God, in the city of Rouen, which Robert had begun. <lb/>
            This was the eighth year of the reign of the emperor Henry <lb/>
            IV., and the fourth of that of Philip, son of Henry king of <lb/>
            France. The same year the Normans obtained possession <lb/>
            of the city of Mans. It was also the tenth year from the <lb/>
            battle of Mortemer, and the seventeenth from that fought <lb/>
            between William and Guy at Valesdunes.1 At the same <lb/>
            time Michael drove his father-in-law Diogenes from the <lb/>
            imperial throne at Constantinople, and seized the crown <lb/>
            which he not long afterwards disgracefully lost. In <lb/>
            England, there was great dissension on the death of King <lb/>
            Edward, Harold, the perjured son of Godwin, who had no <lb/>
            claim to royal blood, having usurped the throne by fraud <lb/>
            and violence. <lb/>
            History's ancient annals fix <lb/>
            The year one thousand sixty-six <lb/>
            (Then a fiery comet whirled, <lb/>
            Dreadful omen, round the world), <lb/>
            As the time when England's lord <lb/>
            Fell before the Norman's sword.</p>
          <p>The same year the battle of Senlac was fought, in which <lb/>
            Harold was slain. It was on the second of the ides [14th] <lb/>
            of October that William obtained this victory, and he was <lb/>
            crowned on the following Christmas day.</p>

            pastor, and studied to observe the lessons of the apostolical <lb/>
            law." He was the son of Ralph, count de Bayeux, and <lb/>
            having been originally bishop of Avranches, was elevated to <lb/>
            the primacy, which he held for ten years in the time of <lb/>
            popes Alexander and Gregory VII.2</p>
          <p>46. " Next, William, a prelate of high birth and great <lb/>

            29, 1060), and the eighth of the emperor Henry IV. It was also the <lb/>
            seventeenth after the battle of Valesdunes, and the tenth after that of <lb/>
            Mortemer. In the text of Duchesne, the reference to the battle of Mor­ <lb/>

            a night in the month of May. Pope Urban held a great <lb/>
            council at Clermont, and preached the crusade to Jerusalem <lb/>
            against the infidels.2 At the same time there was a severe <lb/>
            famine in France. In the year of our Lord 1099,3 the <lb/>
            seventh indiction, Jerusalem was taken by the holy pilgrims, <lb/>
            the infidels who had long held it being conquered ; and the <lb/>

            He was buried at Winchester, and his brother Henry <lb/>
            ascended the throne, and was crowned at London on the <lb/>

            on record, in full detail, their continuous succession for the <lb/>
            benefit of those who come after us. For this reason I have <lb/>
            traced the annals of nearly eight hundred years, and have <lb/>
            enumerated the whole series of Roman apostles,2 from Pope <lb/>
            Eusebius to Lambert of Ostia, who, under the name of <lb/>
            Honorius, now fills the apostolic see.3 I have also inserted <lb/>
            in my work the names of all the emperors, from Constan­ <lb/>

            son of Alexius, the reigning emperor there,4 and to Lothaire, <lb/>
            the Saxon, who is now emperor of the Romans.5 I shall <lb/>

            of the inexperience of the king's son Robert, by continually <lb/>
            flattering him, and urging him to fruitless enterprises. <lb/>
            Their language was of the following description: " Most <lb/>
            illustrious son of the king, how is it that you are suffered <lb/>
            to live in such extreme indigence ? Your father's courtiers <lb/>
            so securely guard the treasury that you can scarcely extract <lb/>
            a penny from it to serve a friend. It is a great disgrace to <lb/>
            you, as well as loss to us and to many more, that you are <lb/>
            thus excluded from all share in the royal wealth. Why do <lb/>
            you submit to this ? He it is who deserves to have money, <lb/>
            who has the heart to distribute it freely among those who <lb/>
            ask it. Alas ! your great liberality is miserably curtailed <lb/>
            by the poverty to which your father's parsimony restricts <lb/>
            you; and, not content with chasing his own attendants, he <lb/>
            imposes upon you men of his own choice for yours. How <lb/>
            long, brave prince, will you bear this ? Rouse yourself <lb/>
            manfully, and demand from your father a share of the <lb/>
            kingdom of England, or at least claim the duchy of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, which he long ago granted you in the presence <lb/>
            of a numerous assemblage of the barons, who are ready to <lb/>
            support you. It does not become you to submit any <lb/>
            longer to be lorded over by those who are born to be your <lb/>
            servants, and to have your demands for your hereditary <lb/>
            domains rejected, as if you were a stranger and a mendicant. <lb/>
            If your father agrees, and grants your request, your natural <lb/>
            spirit and incomparable goodness will be magnificently dis­ <lb/>
            played. But if, on the other hand, he persists in his <lb/>
            obstinacy, and, giving way to his avarice, refuses you the <lb/>
            dominions which are your right, assume the lion's part, drive <lb/>
            from your presence those who are a disgrace to you while <lb/>
            they serve you, and rely on the counsels and support of <note type="footnote"> the long series of quarrels between William I. and his eldest son. A <lb/>
            passage in book iv. (p. 78) would seem to prove that they commenced as <lb/>
            early as the year 1074, but we are not able to place the occurrences at <lb/>
            L'Aigle, which seem to have caused Robert's first departure, earlier than <lb/>
            the year 1078. One of our principal reasons is the extreme youth, even <lb/>
            then, of Henry, one of the princes concerned in them, who was born in <lb/>
            1068. Perhaps we ought, with Florence of Worcester, to assign these <lb/>
            occurrences to the year 1077, and place the discussion between Robert <lb/>
            and his father, which our author here proceeds to relate, before the <lb/>
            attempt of the former to surprise the tower of Rouen, which was followed <lb/>
            by his taking refuge with Hugh de Chateau-neuf. </note> <pb n="171"/>

            second all your wishes."</p>
          <p>Prince Robert, listening like a raw youth to speeches of <lb/>
            this sort, had his wrath and ambition violently inflamed, so <lb/>
            that he went to his father and said: My lord the king, <lb/>
            put me in possession of Normandy, which you granted me <lb/>
            long ago, before you crossed the sea to make war on <lb/>
            Harold." 1 To which the king replied: "What you ask, <lb/>
            my son, is not convenient. It was by Norman valour that <lb/>
            I made the conquest of England. Normandy is mine by <lb/>
            hereditary descent, and I will never, while I live, relinquish <lb/>
            the government." Robert then said : " But what am I to <lb/>
            do, what have I to bestow on my followers ?" His father <lb/>
            answered: " Be obedient to me in all things, as becomes <lb/>
            you, and be wisely content to share my power in all my <lb/>
            dominions, as a son under his father." But Robert re­ <lb/>
            torted : " I am not content to act for ever the part of a <lb/>
            mercenary. I desire to have an establishment of my own, <lb/>
            that I may be able worthily to recompense my attendants <lb/>
            for their services. I therefore pray you give up to me the <lb/>
            dukedom which is my own, that while you are king of <lb/>
            England, I may be duke of Normandy, but subject always <lb/>
            to fealty, to you." But the king replied : " What you ask, <lb/>
            my son, is quite preposterous. It is shameful to wish to <lb/>
            deprive your father of the dominions, which, if you are <lb/>
            worthy, you will receive from him in due course, with the <lb/>
            willing assent of the people and the blessing of God. <lb/>
            Choose good advisers, and drive from your presence the <lb/>
            rash young men who imprudently tempt and urge you to <lb/>
            criminal enterprises. Remember what Absalom did ; how <lb/>
            he rebelled against his father David, and how ill it turned <lb/>
            out, not only to himself but to Ahitophel and Amasa, and <lb/>
            his other councillors and abettors. The Normans, always <lb/>
            restless, are eagerly longing for some disturbance. They <lb/>
            are endeavouring to incite you to some absurd attempt, in <lb/>
            order that in the confusion which would ensue, they may <lb/>
            give the reins to their own insubordinate desires, and <lb/>
            commit evil with impunity. Do not listen to the persua- <note type="footnote"> I It has been already stated that William named his son Robert as his <lb/>
            successor in the duchy of Normandy long before the conquest of England, <lb/>
            but there was no idea of its being given up to him during his father s life. </note> <pb n="172"/>

            the archbishops William and Lanfranc, and other men of <lb/>
            wisdom, and experienced nobles. If you carefully attend <lb/>
            to what I say to you, you will in the end be glad of your <lb/>
            good conduct. But if, on the other hand, you follow the <lb/>
            example of Rehoboam, who treated with contempt the <lb/>
            counsels of Benaiah and other wise men, and suffer yourself <lb/>
            to be led by these foolish youths, you will long suffer to <lb/>
            your own cost the humiliation and contempt which he <lb/>
            experienced before his own people and strangers." Robert <lb/>
            then said: " My lord the king, I did not come here to hear <lb/>
            speeches, of which I have had enough, and more than <lb/>
            enough, to my infinite disgust from my teachers of grammar; <lb/>
            answer me plainly concerning the dominion which is my <lb/>
            right, that I may know what I have to do. One thing I am <lb/>
            resolved on, and I wish every one to know it, that I will no <lb/>
            longer do service to any one in Normandy in the mean <lb/>
            condition of a dependant."</p>
          <p>The king was greatly incensed at this language, and re­ <lb/>
            plied : " I have already told you plainly enough, and I have <lb/>
            no hesitation in most distinctly informing you that I will <lb/>
            never suffer my native land of Normandy to pass out of my <lb/>
            hands as long as I live. Nor will I, neither is it advisable <lb/>
            that I should, during my life, divide the kingdom of Eng­ <lb/>
            land which I have acquired by immense exertions; for, as <lb/>
            our Lord says in the gospel, ' Every kingdom divided against <lb/>
            itself is brought to desolation. 1 He who gave me the king­ <lb/>
            dom will dispose of it according to his will. I wish it to be <lb/>
            understood by all as my fixed purpose that, so long as I live, <lb/>
            I will not abdicate my prerogative in favour of any one, and <lb/>
            no human being shall share my kingdom. The consecrated <lb/>
            crown was solemnly placed on my head by Christ's repre­ <lb/>
            sentatives, and the royal sceptre of Albion was given to me <lb/>
            alone to bear. It is therefore unbecoming, and altogether <lb/>
            unjust, that while life remains, I should suffer any one to <lb/>
            become my equal or my superior within my dominions." <lb/>
            Upon hearing his father's irrevocable determination, Robert <lb/>
            said: " Compelled, like Polynices the Theban, to betake my­ <lb/>
            self to a foreign land, henceforth I shall serve strangers, and <lb/>
            see whether by fortune's favour I cannot gain in exile those <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke xi. 17. </note> <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 1077—1078.]"/> <lb/>
            honours and advantages which are shamefully withheld from <lb/>
            me in my father's house. Would that it may be mine to <lb/>
            find a prince like the old Adrastes, to whom I can cheerfully <lb/>
            offer the tribute of my faithful service, and from whom I <lb/>
            may receive a grateful acknowledgment."</p>
          <p>Having said this, Robert left his father's presence in <lb/>
            great anger, and departed from Normandy. There went <lb/>
            with him Robert de Belesme,1 William de Breteuil,2 Roger, <lb/>
            son of Richard de Bienfaite, Robert de Moubray,3 William <lb/>
            de Molines, William de Rupierre, and several others of high <lb/>
            birth and chivalrous courage, swelling with pride, terrible in <lb/>
            their fierce encounters with enemies, and ready to undertake <lb/>
            any enterprise however formidable or unjust. At the head <lb/>
            of a band of such associates, the young Robert wandered in <lb/>
            foreign lands for five years to no purposed He had already <lb/>
            freely distributed among them his private patrimony, making <lb/>
            vain promises of aggrandizing their possessions. On their <lb/>
            part they exalted his hopes by empty professions; and they <lb/>
            thus mutually deceived each other by false representations.</p>
          <p>When Robert first quitted his native land, he joined his <lb/>
            uncle Robert the Frisian, count of Flanders, and his brother <lb/>
            Eudes, who was archbishop of Treves.5 He afterwards <lb/>
            visited other noble kinsmen, dukes, counts, and powerful <lb/>
            lords of castles in Lorraine, Germany, Aquitaine, and Gas­ <lb/>
            cony. To these he stated his grievances, in which he often <lb/>
            mixed falsehood with truth. Many listened readily to his <lb/>
            complaints, and the higher nobles made him liberal presents ; <lb/>
            but he foolishly lavished on jugglers, parasites, and harlots, <lb/>
            the supplies he received from his generous friends. When <lb/>
            they were thus improvidently spent, he was compelled by <lb/>
            his extreme necessities to have recourse to begging, and, an <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert de Belesme, son of Roger de Montgomery. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 William de Breteuil, son of William Fitz-Osbem. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Robert de Moubray. nephew of Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Our author confounds Prince Robert's first emigration with his second, <lb/>

            exile and poor, he sought loans of money from foreign <lb/>
            usurers.</p>
          <p>Queen Matilda, compassionating her son's distresses with <lb/>
            a mother's tenderness, often sent him, without the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of her husband, large sums of gold and silver, and <lb/>
            other things of value. The king, discovering this, forbade <lb/>
            her with terrible threats from continuing to do so; but <lb/>
            finding shortly afterwards that she contumaciously repeated <lb/>
            the offence, he said to her, in great wrath, " A wise man <lb/>
            remarked truly, as I myself have reason to find, that­ <lb/>
            ' A faithless woman is her husband's bane.'</p>
          <p>Who in the world can henceforth reckon on finding a mis­ <lb/>
            tress who will be faithful and devoted to him ? Behold my <lb/>
            own wife, whom I love as my very soul, and who is entrusted <lb/>
            by me with my treasures and jurisdiction through my whole <lb/>
            dominions, succours my enemies who are plotting against <lb/>
            my life, enriches them with my wealth, carefully supplies <lb/>
            them with arms to attack me, and abets and strengthens <lb/>
            them in every way." To this Matilda replied: " Do not <lb/>
            wonder, I pray you, my lord, that I have a tender affection <lb/>
            for my first-born son. By the power of the Most High,1 if <lb/>
            my Robert was dead, and buried seven feet in the earth out <lb/>
            of the sight of living men, and I could bring him to life at <lb/>
            the expense of my own blood, I would freely shed it for <lb/>
            him, and I would undergo sufferings greater than can be <lb/>
            expected from female weakness. How can you suppose that <lb/>
            I can take any delight in the abundance of wealth, while I <lb/>
            suffer my son to be crushed by the extremity of want and <lb/>
            distress ? Far from me be such hardness of heart, nor <lb/>
            should you, in the fulness of your power, lay such an injunc­ <lb/>
            tion upon me."</p>
          <p>At hearing this the stern prince turned pale, and he <lb/>
            became so enraged that he ordered one of the queen's <lb/>
            messengers, whose name was Samson, a Breton by birth, to <lb/>
            be apprehended, and to have his eyes forthwith put out. <lb/>
            However, learning the king's animosity by intelligence from <lb/>
            those the queen trusted, he made his escape to avoid the <note type="footnote"> 1 This appears to have been the form of oath used by Queen Mitilda, <lb/>
            as her husband, William, swore by God's light, par la resplendor Dé. </note> <pb n="175"/>

            barbarous command, and took refuge in all haste at the <lb/>
            abbey of St. Evroult. He was admitted, at the queen's <lb/>
            request, by Abbot Mainier, and entered on the monastic life <lb/>
            for the safety equally of his soul and body. He was <lb/>
            shrewd, talked well, was continent, and lived as a monk <lb/>
            twenty-six years.</p>
          <p>At this time there lived in some part of the Teutonic <lb/>
            country a hermit, who was a devout and holy man, and <lb/>
            among his other gifts and graces had the spirit of prophecy. <lb/>
            To this man, Queen Matilda sent messengers and presents, <lb/>
            earnestly entreating him to pray for her husband and her <lb/>
            son Robert, and besides to send her a prediction of what <lb/>
            would happen to them in time to come. The hermit gra­ <lb/>
            ciously received the messenger of so great a queen, and <lb/>
            begged time to the third day for making his reply. When <lb/>
            the third day dawned, he summoned the queen's envoys and <lb/>
            said to them: " Go, carry back this message from me to <lb/>
            your mistress. According to your request I have prayed to <lb/>
            God and have seen a vision, in which he revealed to me the <lb/>
            things I will relate to you. I saw a certain meadow, beau­ <lb/>
            tifully clothed with grass and flowers, and in it there was a <lb/>
            fierce horse feeding. Herds of cattle stood all round, keenly <lb/>
            desiring to graze in the meadow, but the wild horse drove <lb/>
            them away, not suffering any animal to come there and crop <lb/>
            the grass and the flowers. Unfortunately, the stately and <lb/>
            high-bred horse suddenly disappeared, and a lascivious heifer <lb/>
            undertook the guardianship of the luxuriant meadow. Forth­ <lb/>
            with, the whole herd of animals which stood outside ran <lb/>
            freely in, and depasturing the meadow in every part, de­ <lb/>
            stroyed all its former beauty, without fear of its guardian, <lb/>
            treading it under foot, and defiling it with their dung. On <lb/>
            seeing this I was much astonished, and asked my conductor <lb/>
            what it meant. He therefore explained the whole, saying: <lb/>
            ' The meadow which you behold is Normandy, and the grass <lb/>
            is the multitude of people, living in peace and in abundance <lb/>
            of all things. The flowers represent the churches, where <lb/>
            are to be found the chaste companies of the monks and <lb/>
            clergy and nuns, and where faithful souls are continually <lb/>
            engaged in holy contemplations. The unbridled horse sig­ <lb/>
            nines William, king of the English, under whose protection <pb n="176"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. CH.X. </note> <lb/>
            the sacred orders of the devout securely war for the king <lb/>
            of angels.' The greedy animals which stand around are the <lb/>
            Franks, the Bretons, and the men of Picardy and Anjou, <lb/>
            and other neighbouring people, who are jealous of the pros­ <lb/>
            perity of Normandy, and are ready to pounce upon its <lb/>
            resources, like wolves on their prey, but are repelled by the <lb/>
            unconquerable might of King William. But when, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the laws of human nature, he shall be taken away, <lb/>
            his son Robert will succeed him in 'the dukedom of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy. Then her enemies will gather around her on all <lb/>
            sides, and, as she will have lost her protector, they will <lb/>
            invade her rich and noble territory, despoil her of her <lb/>
            honour and her wealth, and holding in contempt her weak <lb/>
            ruler, nefariously tread under foot the whole country. He, <lb/>
            like the lascivious heifer, will abandon himself to lust and <lb/>
            sloth, and set others the example of plundering the property <lb/>
            of the church, and spending it on filthy pimps and lechers. <lb/>
            To such he will give up his dominions, and they will be his <lb/>
            counsellors in his urgent necessities. In the dukedom of <lb/>
            Robert, favourites and effeminate persons will bear rule, <lb/>
            and under their government crime and misery will abound. <lb/>
            The cities and villages will be burnt, and the churches of <lb/>
            the saints shamefully profaned. The societies of the faith­ <lb/>
            ful, of both sexes, will be dispersed, and thousands of <lb/>
            human beings will perish by fire and sword, many of them <lb/>
            unabsolved and without the last sacraments, so that for <lb/>
            their sins they will be plunged at once into the bottomless <lb/>
            pit. Such calamities will fall upon Normandy, and as of <lb/>
            old she was enormously puffed up, as the conqueror of <lb/>
            neighbouring nations, so under a lax and debauched prince, <lb/>
            she will be held in contempt, and will be long and miserably <lb/>
            exposed to the arms of her enemies. The weak duke will <lb/>
            have only the name of prince, while in truth rogues will <lb/>
            have the rule, both over him and the distracted province, to <lb/>
            the general loss.' Such was the vision which I lately had <lb/>
            in answer to my prayers, and such the explanation which <lb/>
            my spiritual guide gave of it. But you, venerable lady, will <lb/>
            not witness the calamities with which Normandy is threat- <note type="footnote"> 1 There is a play of words in the original text: Regem Anglorum ... <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1079.] </note> <lb/>
            ened ; for, after a good confession, you will die in peace, and <lb/>
            neither behold your husband's death, nor the misfortunes of <lb/>
            your son, nor the desolation of your beloved country."</p>
          <p>Having received this message from the hermit, the messen­ <lb/>
            gers returned and related to the queen the prophecy in <lb/>
            which good was mixed with evil. The men of the succeeding <lb/>
            age, who were partakers in the disasters of Normandy and <lb/>
            saw the fires and other ravages, found to their cost that the <lb/>
            prophecy of the horrible calamities and destruction which <lb/>
            awaited them was but too true.</p>
          <p>At last, after many useless peregrinations, Robert began <lb/>
            to repent of his folly, but still he was unwilling to return <lb/>
            frankly to his incensed father whom he had so inconsiderately <lb/>
            left. He therefore repaired to his cousin Philip, king of <lb/>
            France, and earnestly entreated him to render him aid. He <lb/>
            was well received, and the castle of Gerberoi assigned to him <lb/>
            for his residence, because it stands in the Beauvais on the <lb/>
            borders of Normandy, and is a very strong fortress <lb/>
            both from its site and its walls and other defences. Elias <lb/>
            the vidame, and his fellow governor of the castle, received <lb/>
            the royal exile with great good-will, promising all sorts of <lb/>
            succour to him and his followers. For it is the custom of <lb/>
            that castle that it has two equal lords,1 and that all <lb/>
            fugitives are harboured there from whatever quarter they <lb/>
            come. Robert collected in this place a troop of horse, <lb/>
            promising them and the barons of France who flocked about <lb/>
            him, in return for their assistance, more than he could ever <lb/>
            perform. Many evils ensued from this arrangement, the <lb/>
            sons of perdition taking arms and devising mischief against <lb/>
            the peaceable and defenceless, and contriving endless iniqui­ <lb/>
            ties. Numbers who to all appearance had been peaceably <lb/>
            inclined, and gave good words to the king and his adherents, <lb/>
            now unexpectedly joined the enemies of the state, betraying <lb/>
            their kinsfolk and lords to the disinherited exiles. Thus Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy had more to suffer from her own people than from <lb/>
            strangers, and was ruined by intestine disorders.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the undaunted king had levied numerous bodies <lb/>
            of troops with prudent forethought, and quartered them in <lb/>
            the castles of his own province which stood nearest the <note type="footnote"> I Two collateral branches of the same family possessed jointly the title <lb/>

            enemy's borders, making head against his adversaries in all <lb/>
            quarters, and suffering no one to make inroads on his <lb/>
            territories with impunity. He was also much annoyed that <lb/>
            his enemies had chosen a post so near his own frontier, <lb/>
            nor would he submit to it any longer without a sharp <lb/>
            contention. He therefore, although it was mid-winter, <lb/>
            assembled his mailed troops, as soon as Christmas was <lb/>
            past, and paid a visit to the enemies' quarters at Gerberoy <lb/>
            from which he had received threatening messages; and for <lb/>
            three weeks he besieged the garrison with great vigour. The <lb/>
            chiefs on both sides had frequent encounters, and often chal­ <lb/>
            lenged each other to the conflict with a select number of <lb/>
            followers chosen for their bravery and skill in arms. On one <lb/>
            side the Normans, with the English and the king's auxiliaries <lb/>
            from the immediate neighbourhood, made fierce onslaughts, <lb/>
            on the other, the French and King William's enemies on <lb/>
            the borders, who took the side of Robert, made a desperate <lb/>
            resistance. In these conflicts many were unhorsed, horses <lb/>
            were killed, and the combatants suffered considerable losses.'</p>
          <p>The king having returned "to Rouen, his faithful coun­ <lb/>
            sellors took into consideration the means of reconciling the <lb/>
            father and son. With this view Roger, earl of Shrewsbury, <lb/>
            Hugh de Gournay and Hugh Grantmesnil, Roger de Beau­ <lb/>
            mont, with his sons Robert and Henry,2 and many others <lb/>
            assembled. They addressed the king in the following <lb/>
            terms : " Great king, we humbly approach your highness, <lb/>
            beseeching you favourably to receive our supplications. <lb/>
            Your son Robert has been led astray by the pernicious <lb/>
            advice of evil counsellors, from which violent dissentions <lb/>
            and much mischief have arisen. He now repents of his <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author's account of the siege of Gerberoi is far from complete. <lb/>
            He has omitted to inform us that Philip I. joined William, the duke, in <lb/>
            besieging his son Robert in the very place he had assigned him for his <lb/>
            refuge. This appears from a charter signed jointly by the two kings while <lb/>
            engaged in the siege, which also fixes the date of its commencement, in the <lb/>
            month of January, 1079. Ordericus ha3 also omitted the well known <lb/>
            story of Robert's having wounded and dismounted his father in one of the <lb/>
            chivalrous encounters under the walls of Gerberoi, and, discovering him by <lb/>
            his voice, having remounted him on his own horse after vainly imploring <lb/>
            his forgiveness. It was probably in consequence of this occurrence, and at <lb/>
            all events after it, that the lords of William's council named by Ordericus <lb/>
            succeeded in effecting a temporary reconciliation. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Robert, count de Meulan, and Henry, earl of Warwick. </note> <pb n="179"/>

            errors, but he cannot venture to approach your presence <lb/>
            without receiving your commands. He humbly implores <lb/>
            your clemency to take pity on him, and he seeks to obtain <lb/>
            your favour through our interference, who are your devoted <lb/>
            subjects. He acknowledges himself to be guilty of many <lb/>
            and grave offences, but he confesses them, and promises to <lb/>
            conduct himself better in future. We all, therefore, join in <lb/>
            imploring your clemency to extend your gracious pardon to <lb/>
            your repentant son. Correct your erring child, permit him <lb/>
            to return home, and mercifully accept his penitence." The <lb/>
            assembled nobles also earnestly interceded with the king on <lb/>
            behalf of their sons, brothers, and kinsmen, who accom­ <lb/>
            panied Robert in his exile. The king replied to them as <lb/>
            follows : "I am surprised that you so earnestly plead the <lb/>
            cause of a traitor, who has dared to make a most infamous <lb/>
            attempt on the peace of my dominions. He has stirred up <lb/>
            intestine disturbances against me, and seduced the flower of <lb/>
            ray young nobility whom I myself have educated and in­ <lb/>
            vested with the ensigns of chivalry. He has also brought <lb/>
            on me Hugh de Chateauneuf,1 and other foreign enemies. <lb/>
            Which of my predecessors, from the time of Rollo, has <lb/>
            been subjected to such a conflict on the part of his sons as <lb/>
            I have ? Look at William, the son of the great Rollo, and <lb/>
            the three Richards, successively dukes of Normandy, and <lb/>
            my own father Robert, and see how faithfully they obeyed <lb/>
            their fathers to the hour of their death. This youth en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to wrest from me the dukedom of Normandy and <lb/>
            the earldom of Maine, and he has formed against me a <lb/>
            powerful combination of the French, the people of Anjou <lb/>
            and Aquitaine, and many others. If it were in his power <lb/>
            he would arm the whole race of mankind against me, <lb/>
            and put me, and yourselves too, to the sword. According <lb/>
            to the law of God given by Moses, he is worthy of death : <lb/>
            his offence is like that of Absalom, and should meet with <lb/>
            the same punishment."</p>
          <p>Still the nobles of Normandy had frequent conferences <note type="footnote"> I Châteauneuf in the Thimirais; see before, book iv. p. 109. This <lb/>
            passage strengthens the opinion that the quarrel began at L'Aigle, oil <lb/>

            with the king, and endeavoured to mollify his resentment <lb/>
            by gentle remonstrances and entreaties. The bishops, also, <lb/>
            and other men of religion, tried to soften the hardness of his <lb/>
            heart by lessons drawn from the word of God. The queen, <lb/>
            also, and the envoys of the king of France, and the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring nobles who were in alliance with him, used their <lb/>
            efforts to restore peace. At last the stern prince, giving <lb/>
            way to the entreaties of so many persons of rank, and <lb/>
            moved likewise by natural affection, was reconciled to his <lb/>
            son, and those who had been leagued with him. He also, <lb/>
            with the concurrence of his nobles, ratified and renewed the <lb/>
            grant which he had made to him, when he was sick at <lb/>
            Bonneville,1 of the succession to the duchy of Normandy <lb/>
            after his own death. The restoration of peace caused great <lb/>
            joy to the people of Normandy and Maine, who had now <lb/>
            grievously suffered for many years from the calamities of <lb/>
            war. But this long-wished-for tranquillity, arising from the <lb/>
            reunion of father and son, was speedily overclouded. For <lb/>
            the obstinate young prince was too proud to attend or obey <lb/>
            his father, and the passionate monarch often loaded him in <lb/>
            public with accusations and reproaches for his disobedience. <lb/>
            He, therefore, after a time, again left his father's court2 ac­ <lb/>
            companied by a small number of adherents; nor did he ever <lb/>
            return until his father on his death-bed sent Count Aubrey8 <note type="footnote"> I Bonneville sur Touque. The text of Duchesne; for Villam-Bonam, <lb/>

          <p>IF William, though a father, sometimes cursed in his anger <lb/>
            his rebellious son, and wished him all sorts of evil for the <lb/>
            attempts which have been just related, his sons William and <lb/>
            Henry, who had been always dutiful, received his hearty <lb/>
            blessing. As for his son Richard, born after Robert, and <lb/>
            who had not yet received the honour of knighthood, while <lb/>
            he was hunting in the new forest not far from Winchester, <lb/>

            blow on the pommel of the saddle from a stout hazel bough, <lb/>
            and was mortally injured. Receiving the same week the <lb/>
            supports of confession and absolution, and the last sacra­ <lb/>

            many of the English.' William Rufus and Henry having <lb/>
            always been devoted to their father obtained his blessing, <lb/>
            and had for many years been advanced to the highest pitch <lb/>
            of power both in the kingdom and the duchy. His daughter <lb/>
            Agatha, who had been betrothed to Harold, was afterwards <lb/>
            demanded in marriage by Alphonzo, king of Galicia, and <lb/>
            delivered to his proxies to be conducted to him. But she, <lb/>
            who had lost her former spouse who was to her liking, felt <lb/>
            extreme repugnance to marry another. The Englishman <lb/>
            she had seen and loved, but the Spaniard she was more <lb/>
            averse to because she had never set eyes on him. She, <lb/>
            therefore, fervently prayed to the Almighty that she might <lb/>
            never be carried into Spain, but that he would rather take <lb/>
            her to himself. Her prayers were heard, and she died a <lb/>

            espousals took place at Breteuil, and the marriage was <lb/>

            of Cluny, but in 1126, two years before our author wrote this book, though <lb/>
            he does not seem to have been aware of it, Henry had been made abbot of <lb/>
            Glastonbury. He was raised to the bishopric of Winchester in 1129. The <lb/>

          <p>TIlE eternal Disposer of all events impels by his power and <lb/>
            guides by his wisdom, his bark, the church, through the <lb/>
            storms of this world, and mercifully gives his daily support <lb/>
            to the labourers in his vineyard, strengthening them by his <lb/>
            holy inspirations for their toils and dangers. He thus <lb/>
            providentially guides his church among the tumults of wars <lb/>
            and battles, and secures its advancement in a variety of <lb/>
            ways. This has been most especially shown with respect <lb/>
            to the abbey of St. Evroult, which, though founded in a <lb/>
            poor country, and surrounded by worthless people, has been <lb/>
            defended by divine help against all the threats and malice <lb/>
            of its enemies. Abbot Mainier undertook the charge of <lb/>
            this abbey in the month of July, and has now presided <lb/>
            over it with great advantage twenty-two years and eight <lb/>
            months.1 He introduced into the Lord's fold ninety-two <lb/>
            monks, prudently selected to do his work; and diligently <lb/>
            instructed them how they ought to conduct themselves in <lb/>
            it. He also began to erect the new church, and suitable <lb/>
            houses for the residence of the monks, and by God's aid <lb/>
            completed them with all the beauty so desert a country per­ <lb/>
            mitted. The good reports of their religious life raised the <lb/>
            abbey of St. Evroult to high honour, and gained them the <lb/>
            love of great numbers of persons of all ranks. Many <lb/>
            hastened there to connect themselves with this society, and <lb/>
            become worthy of partaking of its benefits in divine things. <lb/>
            They gave their worldly possessions in order to receive <lb/>
            heavenly ones from God.</p>
          <p>Some, inflamed with divine love, entirely renounced the <lb/>
            world, resigning their wealth to the monastery, according to <lb/>
            the monastic rule, and enforcing on their friends and relations <lb/>
            similar conduct, by their advice and entreaties. Among <note type="footnote"> 1 Mainier, son of Goscelin d'Echaufour, was fourth abbot of St. Evroult. <lb/>
            He was consecrated by Huph, bishop of Lisieux, the 16th of July, 1066. <lb/>
            Our author has considerably varied in his calculations of the period of <lb/>
            Mainier's administration. It appears to have lasted twenty-two years and <lb/>
            seven months, and that he died on the 5th of March, 1089. </note> <pb n="185"/>

            these were Roger de Sap and his brother Odo, Serlo de <lb/>
            Orgères, Razso son of Ilbert, Odo of Dole, Geoffrey of <lb/>
            Orleans, and John of Rheims, and many more who were <lb/>
            both well imbued with learning and fit for God's service. <lb/>
            Some were men of high birth, and took charge of the exter­ <lb/>
            nal affairs of the abbey. Among these, Drogo, son of <lb/>
            Geoffrey de Neuf-Marché,1 and Roger, son of Erneis do <lb/>
            Coutances, nephew of William Warrenne, and Arnold, son <lb/>
            of Humphrey de Tilleul, nephew by his sister of Hugh de <lb/>
            Grantmesnil, and the physician Goisbert, were men about <lb/>
            the court, through whose exertions lands, churches, and <lb/>
            tithes, were obtained for their brethren. Maimer did not <lb/>
            fail to make use of such supporters, and by their means <lb/>
            the abbey increased its advantages, its means, and its pious <lb/>
            inmates.</p>
          <p>This abbot chose for his assistant in the management of <lb/>
            the house Fulk de Guernanville, a- clever and proper per­ <lb/>
            son, to whom he committed the superintendence of the <lb/>
            monastery. He was son of Fulk, dean of Evreux, and <lb/>
            being full of zeal for his order, diligently seconded his <lb/>
            abbot in all things, besides inducing his father to enter the <lb/>
            abbey, and endow it with a great part of his patrimony. <lb/>
            The dean was one of the pupils of Fulbert, bishop of Chartres, <lb/>
            and held a knight's fee by inheritance from his father. <lb/>
            According to the custom of that period, he had a noble <lb/>
            partner,2 whose name was Orielde, who bore him a numerous <lb/>
            offspring. He had eight sons and two daughters, whose <lb/>
            names are as follows: Warin, Christian, Ralph, William, <lb/>

            used freely the beds of concubines, aud openly boasted of <lb/>
            their numerous families of sons and daughters. This cus­ <lb/>

            sion of the unpopulated country, not versed in letters but <lb/>

            always ready to take up arms to defend the lay fees by <lb/>
            military service. At length, Bruno of Lorraine, bishop of <lb/>
            Toul, was called to Rome, and by the providence of God, <lb/>
            became pope, under the name of Leo. While he was <lb/>
            journeying to Rome, he heard the angels singing: " I know <lb/>
            the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord, <lb/>
            thoughts of peace and not of evil," &amp;c.1 This pope applied <lb/>
            himself to do much good, and rendered great services to <lb/>
            those who were committed to his charge, both by his good <lb/>
            deeds and his faithful teaching. He came into France in <lb/>
            the year of our Lord 1019, and consecrated the church of <lb/>
            St. Remigius, the archbishop, at Rheims, on the calends <lb/>
            [1st] of October; and at the instance of Abbot Hermar, <lb/>
            translated the body of the saint with great ceremony to the <lb/>
            place where it is now held in veneration. He then held a <lb/>
            general council at Rheims, and among other canons for the <lb/>
            good of the church, one was made prohibiting priests from <lb/>
            carrying arms and having wives.2 From that time the fatal <lb/>
            practice began gradually to decline. Priests have now <lb/>
            readily ceased from bearing arms, but they are still reluc­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>I propose here shortly to enumerate the possessions of the <lb/>
            abbey of Ouche, that the endowments piously made may be <lb/>
            known to the novices, and that by reference to this account <lb/>
            it may be ascertained by whom or at what time they were <lb/>
            made, or for what price they were purchased. The greedy <lb/>
            owners of worldly possessions are engrossed with these <lb/>
            passing interests, and think little of those which are <lb/>
            supreme and eternal, and men in general scarcely attempt to <lb/>
            do any thing for the hope of heaven, unless they find it for <lb/>
            their temporal advantage. Tithes, which the Lord required <lb/>
            by Moses to be devoted to his service for the use of the <lb/>
            sanctuary and the Levites, are withheld by our temporal <lb/>
            lords, who refuse to restore them to the ministers of the <lb/>
            church, except they are redeemed at a great priced The <note type="footnote"> 1 This bishop held vast estates in the department of L'Eure, as the son <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.V. CH.XIII. </note> <lb/>
            stewards of the alms for the poor admonished laymen to give <lb/>
            back the tithes to the church of God, and in their zeal to <lb/>
            obtain them by any means have often given large sums for <lb/>
            them, in ignorance that the sacred canons absolutely <lb/>
            prohibit any bargains of this sort. Even in modern <lb/>
            councils, the holy bishops have pronounced an anathema <lb/>
            against this traffic, but from merciful considerations have <lb/>
            passed by former offences of the kind, and allowed the <lb/>
            possessions which the church then held to remain in her <lb/>
            hands, under the sanction of this episcopal authority.</p>
          <p>The founders of the abbey of St. Evroult were men of <lb/>
            moderate fortune, who, erecting it on an unfertile soil, <lb/>
            endowed it with some small possessions, widely dispersed, <lb/>
            according to their moderate means, for the support of the <lb/>
            brethren. Their neighbours all around them were ground <lb/>
            down by poverty, and driven by want and their evil dis­ <lb/>
            positions to live by dishonesty, fraud, and robbery, so that <lb/>
            the monks at Ouche were compelled to procure food for <lb/>
            themselves and their visitors from a great distance. But as <lb/>
            they submitted themselves to regular discipline from the <lb/>
            time of their first institution, great nobles and pious <lb/>
            prelates conceived a high regard for them, and providing for <lb/>
            their necessities by gifts of tithes, and churches, and other <lb/>
            endowments, came to be held in great respect.</p>
          <p>Thus Ralph de Conches, son of Roger de Toni, the <lb/>
            renowned standard-bearer of Normandy, intending to go <lb/>
            into Spain,1 came to Ouche, and, attending a chapter of St. <note type="footnote"> church lands in Normandy, which had become the property of laymen <lb/>
            before the age when our author wrote. Every one knows that in England <lb/>
            such possessions did not get into lay hands till the time of Henry VIII., <lb/>
            on the dissolution of the monasteries. In Normandy, and the case was the <lb/>
            same elsewhere in France, the tithes and church lands appear to have <lb/>
            become the prey of the various lords of all degrees who established their <lb/>
            independence in the ninth and tenth centuries, when no law was known <lb/>
            but that of the strongest. There might have been some justice in the <lb/>
            unceasing efforts of the monks in our author's time to influence or extort <lb/>
            the re-grant of the tithes to their legitimate owners, but the only excuse for <lb/>
            their appropriation to the abbeys consists in the very low state to which the <lb/>
            secular or parochial clergy appear to have sunk at that period, both as to <lb/>
            learning and morals. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 His father, Roger, lord of Toni and Conches, had also been in Spain, <lb/>

             <pb n="189"/>
            Evroult, implored pardon from the abbot and monks for <lb/>
            having some time before abetted Arnold d'Echaufour when <lb/>
            he burned the town of Ouche. He then made recompense <lb/>
            to the monks, and laid his gage on the altar, making many <lb/>
            pious vows in case of his safe return. He likewise recom­ <lb/>
            mended to them his physician Goisbert, whom he much <lb/>
            loved, who, as soon as he was departed made his profession <lb/>
            as a monk, and firmly kept it for nearly thirty years to the <lb/>
            end of his days. The aforesaid knight returning home some <lb/>
            time afterwards, did not forget his vow, but, coming to St. <lb/>
            Evroult, gave two acres of vineyard which he had at Toni <lb/>
            for the service of masses in the abbey. He further gave all <lb/>
            that he had at Guernanville, that is to say his land and the <lb/>
            pasnage, so that the first, that of the servants, was not granted, <lb/>
            but the second or third was granted, and none was to be <lb/>
            given for the monks.1 He also gave three yearly tenants,2 <lb/>
            one at Conches, another at Toni, and the third at Acquigni, <lb/>
            which Gerald Gastinel had held of him, and voluntarily <lb/>
            ceded to St. Evroult. Ralph de Toni some years afterwards <lb/>
            took Goisbert the monk with him to England, and through <lb/>
            his means gave to the monks of St. Evroult two farms, one <lb/>
            named Caldecot in Norfolk, and another in the county of <lb/>
            Worcester, called Alvington. All these grants King <lb/>
            William confirmed, and ratified them by a royal charter in <lb/>
            the presence of his great nobles. Likewise Elizabeth, the <lb/>
            aforesaid knight's wife, and Roger and Ralph, his sons, <lb/>
            freely joined in the grant. The witnesses to the charters of <lb/>
            these grants were Roger de Clair, Walter d'Espagne, <lb/>
            William de Pacey, Robert de Romilly, Gerald Gastinel, <lb/>
            Gislebert son of Thorold, Roger de Mucegros, and Walter <lb/>
            de Chaumont. <note type="footnote"> was the founder of the great family of Stanford in England. At the time <lb/>
            of the Domesday record he possessed one hundred and thirty manors, the <lb/>

            female line from Malahulcius, uncle of Rollo, first duke of Normandy. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 It would be difficult now to assign a precise meaning to the grant <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [B.V. CH.XIII. </note> Also, Robert do Vaux gave to St. Evroult one moiety of <lb/>
            two parts of the tithes of Berners. His son Roger, after <lb/>

            Almoign, receiving forty shillings of the currency of Dreux, <lb/>
            and his wife had ten shillings from the monk's charity. <lb/>
            This was freely confirmed by the aforesaid Ralph, who was <lb/>
            the chief lord, and he kindly procured the concurrence of his <lb/>
            wife and children. This Ralph [de Toni] gained great glory <lb/>
            in the wars, and was reckoned among the first of the <lb/>

            the armies of King William and Duke Robert his soil, <lb/>
            princes of Normandy, for nearly sixty years. He carried <lb/>
            off by night Agnes, his half-sister, daughter of Richard, <lb/>
            count of Evreux, and married her to Simon de Montfort. <lb/>
            He obtained, in return, the hand of Isabel, Simon's <lb/>
            daughter, who bore him noble children, Roger, and <lb/>
            Rodolph, and a daughter named Godehilde, who was first <lb/>
            married to Robert, count of Mellent, and then to Baldwin, <lb/>
            SOIl of Eustace, count of Boulogne.1 At length Ralph the <lb/>

            the ninth of the calends of April [ 24th March],and Ralph <lb/>
            his son held the patrimonial estate nearly twenty-four years. <lb/>
            Both on their death were buried with their ancestors in the <lb/>
            abbey of St. Peter at Chatillon.2 Isabel, having been for <lb/>
            some time a widow, repenting of the sinful wantonness in <lb/>
            which she had too much indulged in her youth, gave up the <lb/>

            and jewels; he also confirmed all the grants his vassals had <lb/>

            my life also a mass of the Holy Trinity is to be sung for <lb/>

            offered to the aforesaid marquis,2 as a free gift from the <lb/>
            brethren, fifteen livres in pennies, and conducted him to <lb/>
            the altar with Alberede, Guitmond's daughter, whose <lb/>
            inheritance it was, to confirm the gift. They freely granted <lb/>
            all that has been described in the presence of the whole <lb/>
            convent, and confirmed it by a charter duly offered on the <lb/>
            altar of St. Peter. Sometime afterwards, the aforesaid <lb/>
            knight granted to St. Evroult the church of Bonmoulines, <lb/>
            with all the tithes of corn, and of the mill and oven; to <lb/>
            which Reynold the Little, who at that time had the affairs <lb/>
            of the monks in that place entrusted to him, charitably <lb/>
            added thirty shillings.</p>
          <p>After Alberede had borne her husband two sons, William <lb/>
            and Robert, a divorce took place between her and her <lb/>
            husband on account of consanguinity. The proceedings for <lb/>
            the divorce before the bishop having been completed, <lb/>
            William married another wife, Duda, daughter of Waleran <lb/>
            de Mellent, who bore him two sons, Simon and Hugh, who <lb/>
            were both cut off in their youth by cruel death, leaving no <lb/>
            children. Meanwhile, Alberede embraced a religious pro- <note type="footnote"> 1 Ralph de Guader was nephew of William de Breteuil, to whom <lb/>

            aforesaid William was son of Walter of Falaise, and being <lb/>
            a gallant soldier, King William gave him Guitmund’s <lb/>
            daughter, with the whole fief of Molines. He was too fond <lb/>
            of vain and empty glory, in pursuit of which he was guilty <lb/>
            of indiscriminate slaughter. It is reported that he shed <lb/>
            much blood, and that his ferocity was so great that no one <lb/>
            who was wounded by him, however slightly, escaped with <lb/>
            life. Through prosperity and adversity, he lived to grow <lb/>
            old, and so far as this world is concerned, spent his days in <lb/>
            honour. At length he died at his own castle on the four­ <lb/>
            teenth of the calends of November [19th October], and lies <lb/>
            buried in the chapter-house at St. Evroult.</p>
          <p>His son Robert, inheriting the domains of his ancestors, <lb/>
            was not unmindful of his eternal salvation; he therefore <lb/>
            came to Ouche and renewed the grants of all that his father <lb/>
            and mother had given to the abbey, and freely confirmed all <lb/>
            that the tenants in his lordship had either given or sold to <lb/>
            St. Evroult. This grant he laid on the altar upon the copy <lb/>
            of the gospels, and afterwards received as a free-gift from <lb/>
            the monks five marks of silver and the best horse. For fif­ <lb/>
            teen years be justly governed his paternal fief, defending it <lb/>
            stoutly against his neighbouring enemies, for he was a brave <lb/>
            soldier, though rather slow in his movements. He even <lb/>
            transgressed the command of King Henry, and attacked <lb/>
            Engerrand, surnamed D'Oison, with whom he had frequent <lb/>
            conflicts. This exasperated the king against him, and his <lb/>
            anger being enflamed by malicious accusations, he disin­ <lb/>
            herited him; after which he left Normandy and went to <lb/>
            Apulia, with his wife Agnes, daughter of Robert de Grant­ <lb/>
            mesnil, to whom he was lately married, and he died there <lb/>
            some years afterwards, having been a wanderer among the <lb/>
            dwellings of strangers. The eldest brother being thus vio­ <lb/>
            lently thrust out from his inheritance by the duke, Simon <lb/>
            succeeded to it, and freely confirmed, with the concurrence <lb/>

            neighbour to the inmates of Ouche, she having been <lb/>
            always opposed to the family of Circle, the founders of the <lb/>
            abbey of St. Evroult. At last the righteous Judge, who <lb/>
            spares repentant sinners but exercises vengeance on the im­ <lb/>
            penitent, permitted that cruel woman, who had caused many <lb/>
            great lords to be disinherited and to beg their bread in <lb/>
            foreign lands, to fall herself by the sword of Hugh, from <lb/>
            whom she had wrested his castle on the rock of Igé,1 thus <lb/>
            unjustly depriving him of the inheritance of his fathers. In <lb/>
            the extremity of his distress, he undertook a most audacious <lb/>
            enterprise; for with the assistance of his three brothers, <lb/>
            who were men of undaunted courage, he forced an entry by <lb/>
            night into the chamber of the countess at a place called <lb/>
            Bures2 on the Dive, and there, in revenge for the loss of his <lb/>
            inheritance, cut off her head, as she lay in bed just after <lb/>
            enjoying the pleasures of a bath. The death of this cruel <lb/>
            lady caused much joy to many persons; and the perpe­ <lb/>
            trators of the bold deed instantly took the road for Apulia. <lb/>
            Hugh de Montgomery, who was then in the place with <lb/>
            sixteen men-at-arms,3 on hearing of his mother's murder, <lb/>
            instantly pursued the assassins, but was unable to come up <lb/>
            with them, as they had taken the precaution to break down <lb/>
            behind them the bridges over which they crossed the rivers, <lb/>
            to prevent their falling into the hands of Mabel’s avengers. <lb/>
            It was the winter season, the night was dark, and the <lb/>
            streams being flooded, there were such obstacles in the way <lb/>
            of pursuit, that the assassins, having satiated their revenge, <lb/>
            were able to escape out of Normandy. The brethren of <lb/>
            Troarn, where Durandus was then abbot, gave burial to the <lb/>
            mangled corpse on the nones [5th] of December,' and caused <lb/>
            the following epitaph to be inscribed on her tomb, due more <lb/>
            to the partiality of her friends than to her own merits:- <lb/>

          <p>After the murder of Mabel, count Roger married a <lb/>
            second wife, Adeliza, daughter of Everard du Puiset, one of <lb/>
            the highest of the French nobility. The earl had by his <lb/>
            first wife five sons and four daughters,1 whose names are as <lb/>
            follows: Robert de Belesme, Hugh de Montgomery, Roger <lb/>
            the Poitevin, Philip, and Arnold; Emma, a nun and abbess <lb/>
            of Almenesches, the countess Matilda, wife of Robert, earl <lb/>
            of Morton, Mabel, wife of Hugh de Chateauneuf, and <lb/>
            Sybil, wife of Robert Fitz-Hamon. By his second wife he <lb/>
            had only one son whose name is Everard, and who being <lb/>
            brought up to learning, became attached to the courts of <lb/>
            William and Henry, kings of England, as one of the royal <lb/>
            chaplains. The successor to the former countess was of quite <lb/>
            a different character; for she was remarkable for her good <lb/>
            sense and piety, and frequently used her influence with her <lb/>
            husband to befriend the monks and protect the poor.</p>
          <p>In consequence, the earl repented of the ill turns he had <lb/>
            often done the monks, and prudently endeavoured to efface <lb/>
            his former errors, by his subsequent amendment of life. In <note type="footnote"> 1 1. Robert, count d’Alençon ;2. Hugh de Montgomery, earl of <lb/>

            short, he afterwards strongly supported the monks, and <lb/>
            made them large grants both in Normandy and England. <lb/>
            His charter, made freely before the great officers of his <lb/>
            household, is in these terms:­</p>

            and those of my ancestors, as follows : I order that every <lb/>

            right of pasture for the monk's swine in all my forests for <lb/>

            Edward, but it was probably not Edward the Confessor, but Edward the <lb/>
            Elder, his youngest son being father of Ailward Snow, whose son Algar was <lb/>
            probably the father of Siward Barn and Aldred, as well as of Brightrie, <lb/>

            You, most noble lord, have entertained the project of founding <lb/>
            a monastery, but you have received little encouragement <lb/>
            towards so arduous an undertaking from those about you, <lb/>
            who, in their eagerness to receive benefits for themselves, <lb/>
            are jealous of what is given to others. Now, it appears to <lb/>
            me most desirable that you should found this monastery, <lb/>
            and carefully establishing in it a society of monks belonging <lb/>
            to the holy order of St. Benedict, endow it largely out of <lb/>
            your vast possessions with the means of providing food <lb/>
            and raiment for the true poor in Christ. Consider well <lb/>
            how it is that the well-disciplined brethren are constantly <lb/>
            employed in the monasteries which are under strict rule. <lb/>
            In them, innumerable good deeds are performed daily, and <lb/>
            war is manfully waged against the devil by the soldiers of <lb/>
            Christ. There can be no doubt that the severer be the <lb/>
            conflict to the resolute champion, the more glorious will be <lb/>
            his victory, and the greater his triumphant reward in the <lb/>
            heavenly kingdom. Who can recount the watchings of the <lb/>
            monks, their chants and psalmody, their prayers and <lb/>
            alms-givings, their daily offerings of the mass with floods of <lb/>
            tears ? Followers of Christ, they have but one object, to <lb/>
            crucify themselves, that so they may please God in all things. <lb/>
            They despise the world and lovers of the world, counting <lb/>
            its delights as dung, and its treasures as nothing compared <lb/>
            with their eternal hopes. They have chosen for their lot <lb/>
            coarse and mean garments, insipid and scanty food, and the <lb/>
            entire sacrifice of their own wills for the love of Jesus their <lb/>
            Lord. I need not speak of the chastity of the monks, their <lb/>
            perfect continence, their silence, their modesty of deport­ <lb/>
            ment, their profound submission. ALly mind is bewildered <lb/>
            in recounting so many virtues, and I feel that my tongue <lb/>
            fails entirely in the attempt to describe them. Monks who <lb/>
            are worthy of the name are inclosed in royal cloisters, as if <lb/>
            they were king's daughters, lest they should wander forth <lb/>
            like Dinah, Leah's daughter, and be shamefully defiled, as <lb/>
            she was by Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite,l to the <lb/>
            distress of her righteous father, and the dishonour of her <lb/>
            cruel brethren. Shut out from the world they become their <lb/>
            own guardians against offences, and if they lapse they are <lb/>
            their own accusers in the depth of their retirement, proving <note type="footnote"> 1 Genesis xxxiv. 2. </note> <pb n="200"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V. CH.XIV. </note> <lb/>
            themselves, like gold in the furnace, that they may be <lb/>
            purified from all sinful dross. I believe, therefore, that <lb/>
            their prayers on behalf of those for whom they are offered <lb/>
            ascend direct to the mercy-seat, and obtain from the Lord <lb/>
            of Sabaoth what they supplicate. I have been in most <lb/>
            intimate communication with monks from my earliest youth, <lb/>
            and had a most familiar acquaintance with their proceedings <lb/>
            by close observation. When, therefore, I reflect on the <lb/>
            conduct of all classes of persons who inhabit this earth, and <lb/>
            especially examine the lives of hermits and canons, I con­ <lb/>
            sider them all to be inferior to monks, who live canonically <lb/>
            and observe the rules of their order. I therefore offer to <lb/>
            you, most noble earl, my faithful advice, that while it is in <lb/>
            your power, you cause a stronghold for monks against Satan <lb/>
            to be built for the service of God in the chief seat of your <lb/>
            earldom, which is not yours by inheritance from your <lb/>
            ancestors, in order that these cowled combatants may with­ <lb/>
            stand the devil in a continual conflict for the good of your <lb/>
            soul.</p>
          <p>" There stands on the river Meoel, a homestead which you <lb/>
            lately granted me, on which I have commenced building a <lb/>
            church of stone, in fulfilment of a vow I made last year <lb/>
            when at Rome before the altar of St. Peter, prince of the <lb/>
            apostles. This church, which, as I said before, I lately com­ <lb/>
            menced building in performance of my vow, with the home­ <lb/>
            stead and all my property appertaining to it, I freely offer <lb/>
            to Almighty God, and promise that I will aid the work in all <lb/>
            things according to the best of my ability in the name of <lb/>
            Jesus Christ. Come to an immediate decision, resolutely <lb/>
            begin and prosecute worthily this work of God:— <lb/>
            “‘'Tis dangerous to delay a work resolved on.’1</p>
          <p>" Fellow labourers in the good work will not be wanting, <lb/>
            nor those who will offer devout prayers for you after your <lb/>
            death. In the first place, as soon as the monks arrive with <lb/>
            masons to lay the foundations of the abbey, I will advance, <lb/>
            as a beginning, fifteen pounds sterling. In the next place, I <lb/>
            will devote myself with my son Benedict, who is now five <lb/>
            years old, and all that I possess to the service of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Lucan Pharsal. i. 281. </note> <pb n="201"/>

            monastery, under the condition that whereas one moiety of <lb/>
            all shall pass with myself under the power of the monks, <lb/>
            the other moiety shall be held by my son Everard as a fief of <lb/>
            the abbey. Having placed my eldest son Ordericus for <lb/>
            some time, under a learned master to acquire the rudi­ <lb/>
            ments of a liberal education,1 I have secured him a safe <lb/>
            retreat among the servants of God at the abbey of St. <lb/>
            Evroult in Normandy, paying out of my substance thirty <lb/>
            marks of silver to his future superiors and fellows as an <lb/>
            offering on his reception. I thus surrender my eldest son for <lb/>
            the love of my Saviour, and destine him to banishment over <lb/>
            the sea, that, a voluntary exile, he may enter the service of <lb/>
            the King of heaven among foreigners, where, free from all <lb/>
            family ties and hurtful affections, he may be the more de­ <lb/>
            voted to the monastic duties and the worship of the Lord. <lb/>
            All this I have long wished, by God's inward motions, and <lb/>
            have above all things desired to devote myself and my chil­ <lb/>
            dren to this way of life, that I may be found worthy by <lb/>
            God's grace to be numbered with them among the elect at <lb/>
            the day of account."</p>
          <p>Accordingly, in the year of our Lord 1083,2 the fourth <lb/>
            indiction, Earl Roger, approving the prudent advice of his <lb/>
            faithful counsellor, summoned his viscount Warin, and Pigot <lb/>
            de Say,3 and the rest of his great officers, to meet on Saturday <note type="footnote"> 1 The master was Siward, the “noble priest," so often mentioned, who <lb/>
            lived in the suburbs of Shrewsbury, which may thus claim our author for <lb/>
            its first scholar. Ordericus, in the next paragraph, dates the foundation of <lb/>
            the abbey in ] 083, and as he was not sent to St. Evroult until the year 1086, <lb/>

            stood to speak of that journey as an accomplished fact, the date assigned <lb/>
            for the foundation is too early, as will presently appear on other grounds. <lb/>
            It has, indeed, been suggested, that as Ordericus frequently retouched his <lb/>
            MS., which lay by him for many years, be may have introduced and some­ <lb/>

            the fifth of the calends of March [25th February]. Having <lb/>
            made known his design, it was generally approved ; upon <lb/>
            which the earl, attended by his chief men, proceeded to the <lb/>
            church of St. Peter the apostle, where he took a vow before <lb/>
            many witnesses that he would erect an abbey on that spot, <lb/>
            and he gave to St. Peter the whole suburb situated outside <lb/>
            of the east gate, in token of which he pledged his gauntlets <lb/>
            on the altar.! The same year two monks of Séez, Reginald <lb/>
            and Frodo, came over for the first time, and with the aid of <lb/>
            Odelirius, Warin, and many others, began to erect the monks' <lb/>
            lodgings. The eloquent Fulchred was the first abbot of this <lb/>
            monastery in the reign of William Rufus, and he was suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded by Godfrey in that of King Henry. Both were <lb/>
            learned and pious pastors, who for nearly forty years care­ <lb/>
            fully nurtured the Lord's flock. Under their superintendence <lb/>
            the external affairs of the new monastery became prosperous, <lb/>
            and they established within an excellent discipline among their <lb/>
            disciples for the good of souls. Odelirius (the father of <lb/>
            Vitalis2), who has been so often mentioned, fully performed <lb/>
            all that he had promised, offering his son Benedict to God in <lb/>
            that society with two hundred silver livres ; and he himself <lb/>
            took the monastic habit there after the death of Earl Roger. <lb/>
            He served God in that monastery as a monk under the rule <lb/>
            of the holy father St. Benedict seven years, and after many <lb/>
            labours for God, having penitentially confessed his sins and <note type="footnote">had also large possessions in Pembrokeshire. In Normandy, Jordan de <lb/>
            Sai founded the abbey of Aulnai about the year 1131. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Instances frequently occur in our author of the ratification of covenants <lb/>

            dignities by the staff or crozier, of which we have instances in our author <lb/>

          <p>Earl Roger survived William the Bastard six years, the <lb/>
            aged lord being among the greatest of the English nobles. <lb/>
            The abbey, of which I have related the foundation, he <lb/>
            moderately endowed with lands and rents. He died there <lb/>
            in the year 1094,2 on the sixth of the calends of August <lb/>
            [July 27], and was buried with distinguished honour in the <lb/>
            new church, between the two altars. His son Robert suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded to all his fiefs in Normandy, and being both cruel <lb/>
            and proud, as well as unjust, he was guilty of endless crimes. <lb/>

            by the stroke of a javelin3 by Magnus, brother of the king <lb/>
            of Norway, and died on the sea-shore; but his corpse was <lb/>
            conveyed to Shrewsbury with great lamentations, and buried <lb/>
            by the monks in the abbey cloister. The prudent old earl <lb/>
            obtained earldoms for his two remaining sons, Roger and <lb/>
            Arnulph,5 who, after his death, lost them both for their trea­ <lb/>

            occupied by Christ's family, and where he, at the age of <lb/>
            sixty, if my memory serves me, voluntarily submitted to the <lb/>

          <p>[ABOUT A.D. 1075.] When Goisbert, a citizen of Chartres, <lb/>
            came to make his profession, as before related,2 he sold an <lb/>
            excellent house, which he possessed in that city, for thirty <lb/>
            pounds sterling of Chartres, and gave the whole to the <lb/>
            monks of St. Evroult with the utmost satisfaction. In per­ <lb/>
            son he was tall and thin, of a kind disposition, conversible, <lb/>
            magnanimous, and liberal. His great skill in medicine made <lb/>
            him well known, and an intimate and useful friend to many <lb/>
            persons. It was through him that Fulcher of Chartres, <lb/>
            Peter de Maule,3 and several others, became acquainted <lb/>
            with the monks of St. Evroult, and, respecting their worth <lb/>
            and piety, gave them a becoming share of their property. <lb/>
            Fulcher was of noble birth, and inherited a large estate <lb/>
            from his father, and being tolerably well educated, became a <lb/>
            canon in the church of the holy Mother of God. He made <lb/>
            a charter of the possessions he granted to St. Evroult, which <lb/>
            Robert Andrew, an excellent scribe, wrote down from his <lb/>
            clear and agreeable dictation in the following terms :­</p>
          <p>" I, Fulcher, son of Gerard, an unworthy canon of the <lb/>

            found that almost all things under the sun are, as Solomon <lb/>
            says, vanity, and that there is nothing on earth which can <lb/>
            bring a blessing to men after the troubles of this life, unless <lb/>
            they have done some good action while they lived. Moved <lb/>
            by these considerations, and in great alarm at the enormity <lb/>
            of my sins, as every one must give an account to God of all <lb/>
            his actions, it has seemed fitting to me (I believe inspired <lb/>
            by God) to make over to St. Evroult some part of my pos­ <lb/>
            sessions for the repose of my own soul and those of my <lb/>
            friends; so that my dear brothers who dwell there may have <lb/>
            something towards the sustenance of their bodies, and may, <lb/>
            in consequence, sometimes be willing to hold me in remem­ <lb/>
            brance. For as to what we leave to our posterity by the <lb/>
            right of inheritance, I not only say that it can be of no <lb/>
            benefit to ourselves after we are dead, but more, that if <lb/>
            we bequeath it ill, it will be greatly injurious. Be it <lb/>
            known therefore to all faithful members of holy church, <lb/>
            that of my own free will, and to the end that provision may <lb/>
            be made for my future welfare; I do hereby grant to St. <lb/>
            Evroult and his monks, to be held by them for ever, the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing hereditaments, though small, as hereinafter mentioned, <lb/>
            that is to say: The church of Moulicent, and one moiety of <lb/>
            the tithes of that village, the church-yard and three acres <lb/>
            of land behind it; also the right of safe keeping at the <lb/>
            manse as Goscelin held it, and the tithe of my mill; if I <lb/>
            establish a market there, they shall also have the tithe of it: <lb/>
            also, the monk who resides at Moulicent shall never pay toll <lb/>
            for his corn. If he desires to grind at his own mill, let him do <lb/>
            so; if he choose rather to grind at mine, let him be toll-free. <lb/>
            Also whatever I possess in Marchèville, the lands, the <lb/>
            manse, the mill, all these I give to the monks for ever. <lb/>
            Moreover I give one plough-land and the manse in the vil­ <lb/>
            lage of Landelles. I also give the tenth of my woods, viz., <lb/>
            of the dues for pasture, and of the honey and beasts-of-chace <lb/>
            there taken. Also, the monks' swine shall be subject to no <lb/>
            dues for pasturage. Neither shall the monks be liable to <lb/>
            any work, or service, or expedition, for me or my heirs, at <lb/>
            any time. And if any of my mesne-tenants shall desire to <lb/>
            give or sell anything to St. Evroult, I grant them full power <lb/>
            to do so without fear of me. All these gifts I freely offer <lb/>
            to Almighty God, to whom I owe my being, and to St. <pb n="206"/>

            Evroult, the glorious confessor; and if any evil-minded or <lb/>

            church, and my wife Alpes and my sons, have also con­ <lb/>
            firmed it."</p>
          <p>The monks of St. Evroult have held for fifty years the <lb/>
            property which the worthy person just mentioned granted to <lb/>
            them, and which his heirs, Bartholomew, surnamed Boël, <lb/>
            and Gerard his son willingly confirmed. There have lived <lb/>
            upon it Aimer, Ralph, Hugh the Englishman, William de <lb/>
            Merle, and several other monks distinguished for their <lb/>
            eloquence and virtues, who were kindly patronized by <lb/>
            Robert, and Geoffrey, Ivo, and Geoffrey II., bishops of <lb/>
            Chartres.1 In this manner, by the zeal of the monks and <lb/>
            the assistance of good men, the church of Marchesville was <lb/>
            erected, and consecrated to St. Mary, mother of God, <lb/>
            through whom the Saviour of the world came.</p>
          <p>At the same time, Landric, Geoffrey, and Gunhier, gave to <lb/>
            St. Evroult all the land of Charancei. Isnard, of whom they <lb/>
            had long held it, releasing it to the monks from all claims, <lb/>
            received six pounds from Abbot Mainier. Afterwards, <lb/>
            Landric and the others before named received back one <lb/>
            moiety of the land, and did fealty for it to the abbot in the <lb/>
            presence of Isnard by joining hands. The same three, <lb/>
            before Isnard and several others, granted the church of that <lb/>
            village with its appurtenances, and the whole tithes, both of <lb/>
            the land which belonged to Isnard and of that which belonged <lb/>
            to St. Stephen or any one else. This grant was made in the <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1073,1 the tenth indiction, and in <lb/>
            the reign of William the Great, king of England and duke <lb/>
            of Normandy, the knight named William Pantulf,2 at the <lb/>
            instance of his friend the venerable Abbot Mainier, and with <lb/>
            the permission of his lord, the Earl Roger, gave to St. <lb/>
            Evroult the churches at Noron,3 one of which was built in <lb/>
            honour of St. Peter, and the other of St. Cyr the martyr, <lb/>
            with his own enclosed park,' and part of the wood of Pont- <lb/>
            Ogeret, and his share in a farm called Molinx, and of <lb/>
            another situated over the brook commonly called Ruptices. <lb/>
            He also gave the whole fee of William de Maloi, comprising <lb/>
            about thirty acres of land. Thereupon he received from the <lb/>
            charity of the monks sixteen pounds of Rouen money to <lb/>
            enable him to undertake a pilgrimage to St. Giles. He also <lb/>
            gave to St. Peter all the land which Walter, son of Rufa <lb/>
            sold to Robert the monk, for which the aforesaid monk gave <lb/>
            him a hundred shillings of Rouen. Moreover, the said <lb/>
            William gave to the monks sixty acres of land in the same <lb/>
            place, the mill at Hommet and the tithes of a moiety of the <lb/>
            mill at Koran. He gave also the church of Emieville,5 with <lb/>
            the tithes and all the rents belonging to the church, and in <lb/>
            the same vill the land of one vavasor, and two sheaves of <lb/>
            the tithes of his own estate, and of all his mesne-tenants in <lb/>
            Mesnil-Baclai, and the whole tithe of the mill of Roiville. <lb/>
            He gave to St. Peter all the land which his mother <lb/>
            Beatrice held in his fief Des Fossés, and the cottier's free <note type="footnote"> 1 Duchesne reads it 1074. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It appears before, book iv. p. 197, that William Pantulf was one of <lb/>

            tenements at St. Germain-d’Aubri.1 Helvis, sister of the <lb/>
            said William, gave to St. Peter all her dowry in Aubri, <lb/>
            which the said William confirmed. He also added the tithe <lb/>
            of his tenants Raimbault, Robert the heretic, and Walo, son <lb/>
            of Saffred. Moreover, the same William gave to St. Peter <lb/>
            de Noron all his churches and the tithes of all places in his <lb/>
            possession in England or Normandy, or which he should <lb/>
            thereafter acquire; together with the tithe of all his chattels, <lb/>
            such as mares, cows, and cheese, and every thing else which <lb/>
            would admit of tithing. In like manner he confirmed what­ <lb/>
            ever his tenants should give or sell to St. Evroult, so that <lb/>
            the fealty due to himself should not be parted with. As for <lb/>
            his effects, he gave them in such wise that after his death <lb/>
            the monks of St. Evreux should have one half, and the monks <lb/>
            of Norun the other.</p>
          <p>All this, William Pantulf, and Lésceline his wife freely <lb/>
            gave to God (as before mentioned), for the repose of their <lb/>
            souls and of those of their friends, and they ratified the gift <lb/>
            in the chapter of the monks of St. Evroult, convened <lb/>
            generally, before many witnesses. William at the same time <lb/>
            paid forty marks of silver towards the support of the monks, <lb/>
            who were about to proceed to Norun to build a cell there.</p>
          <p>Afterwards, Abbot Mainier and Fulk the prior, with <lb/>
            William Pantulf, went to Earl Roger, who was then residing <lb/>
            at Belesme, and humbly petitioned him to confirm the said <lb/>
            knight's grants by his own charter. He, being pious and <lb/>
            liberal, received favourably their lawful petition, and rati­ <lb/>
            fied all their demands, in the presence of those who, on <lb/>
            various affairs, were then attending his court. The feast of <lb/>
            St. Leonard was then being celebrated at Belesme,2 to pay <lb/>
            due honour to which the count, with his usual munificence, <lb/>
            had assembled a great number of guests. Among these <lb/>
            were Hoel, bishop of Mans,3 and Robert, bishop of Séez; <lb/>

          <p>In the year of our Lord 1077, the fifteenth indiction, Ro­ <lb/>
            bert, the. noble abbot,2 brother of Hugh de Grantmesnil, <lb/>
            sought an interview with William, king of England, in Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, and at the king's request pardoned him for having <lb/>
            unjustly driven him into exile. He had received an in­ <lb/>
            vitation from Philip, king of France, who wished to make <lb/>
            him bishop of Chartres, but, as the French disliked sub­ <lb/>
            mitting to Normans, Geoffrey, nephew of Eustace count de <lb/>
            Blois, was appointed to the see. Therefore the illustrious <lb/>
            Robert, having assisted at the consecration of the churches <lb/>
            of Caen, Bayeux, and Bee, which took place that year, and <lb/>
            having had friendly intercourse with King William, and <lb/>
            others his friends and relations whom he had not seen for <lb/>
            many years, went back to Apulia, taking with him William <lb/>
            Pantoul, and Robert de Cordai,3 his nephew, with many <lb/>
            other gallant knights. At that time Robert Guiscard com­ <lb/>
            manded in Apulia, and had acquired the dukedom of Gisulf <lb/>
            duke of Salerno.4 He was the son of Tancred de Hauteville, <lb/>
            a person of moderate station, who, by his bravery and good <lb/>
            fortune, had succeeded in acquiring great power in Italy. <lb/>
            With the aid of his brothers and others of his countrymen <lb/>
            who joined him, he imposed his yoke on the people of <lb/>
            Apulia, and having most unexpectedly risen to great emi­ <lb/>
            nence, he was exalted above all his neighbours, amassed <lb/>
            great wealth, and was continually enlarging his territories. <note type="footnote"> 1 Hugh, bishop of Lisieux, 1049—July 17, 1077 ; Robert, bishop of <lb/>

            He received William Pantoul with distinguished honours, <lb/>
            and making him great promises, tried to retain him in his <lb/>
            service on account of his merit. He made him sit by his <lb/>
            side at dinner on the feast of Easter, and offered him three <lb/>
            towns if he would remain in Italy.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Countess Mabel had perished by the <lb/>
            sword of Hugh D'Igé, the revengeful knight;' and this <lb/>
            murder was the cause of great troubles after William <lb/>
            Pantoul's return from Apulia. For he was accused of <lb/>
            treason, and the charge was prosecuted with great ani­ <lb/>
            mosity by some of his rivals. The deceased lady had taken <lb/>
            possession of the castle of Perai, which had been given to <lb/>
            William; on which account there had long existed a <lb/>
            violent hostility between them. It was hence suspected <lb/>
            that William had contrived her death, particularly as he <lb/>
            was on terms of intimacy and frequent communication <lb/>
            with Hugh. Earl Roger therefore and his sons seized his <lb/>
            whole estate, and sought an opportunity of putting him to <lb/>
            death. In consequence, William and his wife took refuge at <lb/>
            St. Evroult, where they remained for a long time under the <lb/>
            protection of the monks, but in the greatest alarm. The <lb/>
            knight boldly denied the crime of which he was accused; <lb/>
            and no one was able to convict him of it by certain proof, <lb/>
            but while he asserted his innocence, no opportunity was <lb/>
            allowed him of lawfully clearing himself of the charge, as he <lb/>
            offered to do. At length however, by the interference of <lb/>
            many of the nobles, it was determined by the king's court <lb/>
            that the accused should purge himself from the stain at­ <lb/>
            tached to him, by undergoing the ordeal of hot iron at <lb/>
            Rouen, in the presence of the clergy, which was done; for <lb/>
            having carried the flaming iron in his naked hand, by <lb/>
            God's judgment, there was no appearance of its being <lb/>
            burnt, so that the clergy and all the people gave praise to <lb/>
            God. His malicious enemies attended the trial in arms, <lb/>
            intending, if he was declared guilty by the ordeal of <lb/>
            fire, to have immediately beheaded him. During the <lb/>
            troubles to which William Pantoul and his family were <lb/>
            exposed, he was much comforted by Abbot Mainier and the <lb/>
            monks of St. Evroult, who rendered him all the help they <lb/>
            could both with God and man. This increased their mutual <note type="footnote"> 1 On the 5th of December, 1082. See before, p. 194. </note> <pb n="211"/>

            regard, and William offered to St. Evroult four of the <lb/>
            richest palls lie had brought from Apulia, out of which were <lb/>
            made four copes for the chanters in the church, which are <lb/>
            preserved there to this day, and used in the solemn services <lb/>
            of divine worship.</p>
          <p>After the death of William, king of England, William <lb/>
            made another visit to Apulia, and on his return brought <lb/>
            with him the relics of the body of the holy confessor of <lb/>
            Christ, St. Nicholas, with which he enriched the church of <lb/>
            Noron, where they were deposited. He afterwards gave <lb/>
            to the monks of that place a manor in England, called <lb/>
            Trotton,1 with the church and mill of that village, and the <lb/>
            tithes of six hamlets, which belonged to that church. In <lb/>
            the year of our Lord 1112, that is to say, the twelfth year <lb/>
            of the reign of Henry, king of England, and the fourth of <lb/>
            that of Lewis, king of France, William Pantoul came to St. <lb/>
            Evroult, it being the fortieth year after he founded the cell <lb/>
            for monks at Noron, and mindful of his former friendship <lb/>
            and the grants which, as we have already related, he before <lb/>
            made, he recapitulated them, and, with his wife Lesceline, <lb/>
            confirmed them all in a general chapter of the monks. At <lb/>
            the same time Philip, Ivo, and Arnulph, his sons, confirmed <lb/>
            all the grants of their father to the monks of St. Evroult, <lb/>
            and they all, that is to say, William and Lesceline, and their <lb/>
            three sons, Philip, Ivo, and Arnulph, laid the grant on the <lb/>
            altar together. Robert the Bald, Geoffrey and Ascelin, and <lb/>
            several other pious monks, occupied the cell at Noron, <lb/>
            while four bishops, Robert, Gerard, Serlo, and John, were <lb/>
            bishops of Séez,2 and living in the fear of God and love to <lb/>
            man, they set the rustics examples of an honest life. <lb/>
            William Pantoul, so often mentioned, lived long, respecting <lb/>
            the clergy and being kind to the poor, to whom he was <lb/>
            liberal in alms; he was firm in prosperity and adversity, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>RALPH of Mount-Pinçon, steward of William the Great, <lb/>
            king of England, devoted himself with entire fidelity to St. <lb/>
            Evroult, and humbly requested the lord abbot Mainier, <lb/>
            that some clerk, fit for God's service, should be admitted <lb/>
            into the monastery, and made a monk, for the purpose of <lb/>
            constantly offering prayers to God for the souls of himself <lb/>
            and his wife. And this was accomplished; for by God's <lb/>
            providence a certain scholar of Rheims, whose name was <lb/>
            John, was then a postulant for admission to the order. He <lb/>
            was accordingly taken to court, and engaged with the knight <lb/>
            to give him the benefit of his prayers, and of the duties <lb/>
            which he was about to undertake for Christ. Ralph was so <lb/>
            greatly delighted that he humbly kissed the scholar's feet <lb/>
            before all who were present. Upon this the monks most <lb/>
            willingly admitted this John, and had good reason to rejoice <lb/>
            at having him, for he was an excellent grammarian, and <lb/>
            devoted himself unremittingly to useful studies, until he <lb/>
            was advanced in years. The said knight, in consideration of <lb/>
            his maintenance, gave to St. Evroult for ever five mills, <lb/>
            three at Jort, the fourth at a place they call Heurtevent, <lb/>
            and the fifth at Mont-Pinçon;1 also, two sheaves of the <lb/>
            tithes of the villeins of Vaudeloges, and one moiety of the <lb/>
            tithes of Epanai, with two acres of meadow at Emendreville.</p>
          <p>Some years afterwards Ralph, the steward, died on the ides <lb/>
            [13th] of February, and his body was carried to Ouche, and <lb/>
            there buried by the monks in the cloisters at St. Evroult <lb/>
            with great honours. His two sons were present, with their <lb/>
            mother Adeliza, and truly devoted themselves, and all that <lb/>
            their father had given, to St. Evroult, before many witnesses <lb/>
            who were assembled at the funeral of so great a baron. <lb/>
            Thirty years afterwards, Hugh de Mont-Pinçon paid a visit <note type="footnote"> 1 Mont-Pinçon, the chief seat of this family, and the other places here <lb/>

            to his spiritual brothers at St. Evroult, bringing with him <lb/>
            his eldest son Ralph and his wife Matilda, the daughter of <lb/>
            Hugh de Grantmesnil, who was in trouble for the recent <lb/>
            death of her sister Adeline.1 Hugh now renewed his <lb/>
            brotherhood with the monks which he had accepted in his <lb/>
            childhood, and entreated their prayers for his brother Ralph, <lb/>
            who had died on the road while performing a pilgrim­ <lb/>
            age to Jerusalem. Ralph, Hugh's son, a young boy, was <lb/>
            adopted by the monks as his relations had been, and being <lb/>
            led round the chapter by Walter the Bald, a talkative <lb/>
            knight, he kissed the brethren, and then consented to the <lb/>
            grants made by his father and uncle to St. Evroult.</p>
          <p>At length Hugh also died at Rouen when he was sixty <lb/>
            years old on the nones [7th] of March, and by order of his <lb/>
            wife and sons his body was carried to St. Evroult, where <lb/>
            the monks buried their brother's remains with high honour <lb/>
            in the chapter-house, and his saris, Ralph, William, and <lb/>
            Arnulf devoted themselves and all that their ancestors had <lb/>
            granted to the church of St. Evroult. Ralph, the eldest, <lb/>
            married the daughter of Ranulph, chancellor to King Henry,2 <lb/>
            and dying soon afterwards, was buried by the convent in the <lb/>
            chapter-house by the side of his father. William then suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded to the patrimonial estates in Normandy. Arnulf <lb/>
            went into Apulia to seek his uncle William de Grantmesnil. <lb/>
            Matilda, their mother, after her husband's death, fell in love <lb/>
            with a young adventurer named Matthew, in whose company, <lb/>
            deserting her relations and friends, she undertook a journey <lb/>
            to Jerusalem; but both were cut off by premature deaths <lb/>
            in the same year, Matthew dying in Apulia, on the journey <lb/>
            outward, and Matilda at Joppa, on her return.</p>

            who he was, and in what manner and how long he lived <lb/>
            under the monastic rule. His genius was acute, and he was <lb/>
            persevering in his studies; he spent nearly forty-eight years <lb/>
            in the practice of his duties as a monk, and employed him­ <lb/>
            self indefatigably in searching out the meanings of difficult <lb/>
            passages he found in books. He entered the Lord's fold, <lb/>
            being admitted by Abbot Mainier, when he was a young man, <lb/>
            and continuing his service, and being promoted to the priest­ <lb/>
            hood under Serlo and Roger, he engaged others, both by <lb/>
            precept and example, to fight the good fight, and at last died <lb/>
            in the confession of Christ on the tenth of the calends of <lb/>
            April [23rd March],1 when Warin was abbot. He long held <lb/>
            the office of subprior, and often supplied the abbot's place <lb/>
            in preaching the word of God. By order of abbot Roger, <lb/>
            he went to Rome in the time of Pope Urban with the de­ <lb/>
            posed abbot Fulk;2 during which journey he suffered greatly <lb/>
            from sickness, and encountered many hardships. As old <lb/>
            age came on, he suffered for more than seven years from stone <lb/>
            in the bladder; but though he was thus afflicted with a <lb/>
            chronic disease, he did not take to his bed, but rose every day <lb/>
            to join in the divine offices, giving thanks to God; and <lb/>
            being, as I believe, well-prepared, departed in the beginning <lb/>
            of a stormy night. As he was a great versifier, Vitalis the <lb/>
            Englishman,3 his disciple, in the midst of his tears, com­ <lb/>
            posed some verses to his memory on the day he went to his <lb/>
            rest, when the funeral was over, to the following effect: — <lb/>

            His destiny, to learn the cobbler's art, <lb/>
            John early changed, to choose a nobler part, <lb/>
            Gave all his youthful hours to wisdom's lore, <lb/>
            With manhood left the low paternal door, <lb/>
            And, Rheims deserting, traced his venturous way <lb/>
            To where St. Evroult's distant cloisters lay. <lb/>
            Enrolled among the faithful band, to heaven <lb/>
            For fifty years his ardent vows were given. <lb/>
            Nor, sheltered in that safe retreat, the monk <lb/>
            In slothful ease and useless leisure sunk; <lb/>
            But well his subtle genius exercised, <lb/>
            And learning's hoarded treasures keenly prized, <lb/>
            Turning with eager hand the fruitful page <lb/>
            Which held the records of an older age. <lb/>
            Still, first, Christ's claims his earnest care he made, <lb/>
            In daily service, nightly vigil, paid. <lb/>
            By word and deed he true religion taught, <lb/>
            His whole discourse with sacred wisdom fraught. <lb/>
            Sagely he culled for each the doctrines fit, <lb/>
            With lessons chosen well from holy writ; <lb/>
            In every heart strove heavenly thoughts to raise, <lb/>
            And trained the novices in wisdom's ways; <lb/>
            Gave counsel, comfort, and with sharp rebuke, <lb/>
            When duty called, the sinner's conscience shook; <lb/>
            As bees which honey bear beneath their wings, <lb/>
            For time of need are also armed with stings. <lb/>
            His pregnant genius shone in prose and verse, <lb/>
            His matter copious, but his style was terse. <lb/>
            To Christ, the Virgin, and the Saints most blest, <lb/>
            He noblest praise in tuneful songs addressed, <lb/>
            And paid our sainted patron honour due, <lb/>
            Singing the virtues of the good Evroult, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1076, the fourteenth indiction, <lb/>
            when Goisbert the physician was visiting his countrymen <lb/>
            and friends in France, and giving the benefit of his science <lb/>
            to the poor and needy, he found out several of his friends <lb/>
            and acquaintances to whom he had before rendered assist­ <lb/>
            ance by his art, and kindly entreated them to give alms out <lb/>
            of their superfluities for their eternal salvation, especially <lb/>
            admonishing them to give to the monks of St. Evroult such <lb/>
            of their possessions as it did not become laymen to hold. <lb/>
            Sojourning for a time with Peter de Maule, the SOIl of <lb/>
            Ansold, a rich Parisian, and conversing with him in a familiar <lb/>
            and friendly manner, he begged him to make a gift of the <lb/>
            churches at Maule to the monks of St. Evroult. Peter, being <lb/>
            of a gay and liberal disposition and ready to engage in any <lb/>
            large schemes, either good or bad, was easily induced to <lb/>
            consent, and made a deed of gift before his principal tenants. <lb/>
            The text of the charter is as follows :—</p>
          <p>" The shortness of human life, men's want of faith, and the <lb/>
            revolutions of the world, and desolation of states, daily <lb/>
            warn us that the end of the world is at hand. He that was <lb/>
            Truth itself taught us this when it was said to the disciples: <lb/>
            ' When ye shall see these things come to pass, the kingdom of <lb/>
            heaven is nigh.’1 The careful ant ought to provide more <lb/>
            carefully, on it perceiving winter rapidly approaching, so to <lb/>
            lay up her store of corn, that when the frost destroys the <lb/>
            grass she may have an abundant supply of meal. It is also <lb/>
            said in a certain place to those who halt in the way of life: <lb/>
            ' Look well that your flight be not on the sabbath-day or in <lb/>
            the winter.'2 Considering these things, I, Peter, unworthy <lb/>

            future welfare, desire to bring the bees of God's hive into <lb/>
            my orchards, that they may make honey and fill their cells <lb/>
            with honey-comb, rendering thanks to their Creator, and <lb/>
            sometimes bearing in mind their benefactor. I therefore <lb/>
            freely make these trifling offerings from my possessions to <lb/>
            St. Evroult, that the brethren dwelling there may have <lb/>
            wherewith to sustain life and may be better able to remem­ <lb/>
            ber me before God. Whereas, whether we will or no, we <lb/>
            must leave all things here, and after death, nothing can <lb/>
            profit us but the good we may have done in our lives, I have <lb/>
            given and granted, and do give and grant, these lands and <lb/>
            hereditaments to St. Evroult; and by this instrument in <lb/>
            writing under my hand do, for the good of my soul, ratify <lb/>
            and confirm the same for ever. I give the two churches in <lb/>
            the village of Maule,1 that is to say, the church of St. Mary, <lb/>
            and the church of SS. Germain and Vincent, with the church­ <lb/>
            yards, and all which belongs to the parsonage: also, one <lb/>
            plough-land and four cottiers' tenements, and land for a <lb/>
            habitation for the monks, with one orchard, and the quit- <lb/>
            rent of three half-acres in the vineyard of La Mênière, <lb/>
            which Walter the Blind, and his nephew Hugh, surnamed <lb/>
            Muscosus, gave to St. Mary. All these I give for ever to <lb/>
            the monks of St. Evroult, to hold as freely as I hold the <lb/>
            same. Also, if any of my tenants should wish to give any­ <lb/>
            thing to the holy monks in frank-almoign, whatever shall be <lb/>
            so given, without prejudice to my claims of fealty and <lb/>
            without interfering with my right of jurisdiction, I freely <lb/>
            grant for myself and my heirs, in such sort and with this <lb/>
            irrevocable provision, that if any of them should forfeit his <lb/>
            fief for any default, nevertheless the church shall not lose <lb/>
            what it so holds in frank-almoign. All this is confirmed by <lb/>
            my wife Windesmoth, and my sons Ansold, Theobald, and <lb/>
            William, who religiously engage to defend this charitable <lb/>

            good-will towards the servants of God and encouraged by <lb/>
            my good example, have joined the brotherhood of the monks <lb/>
            and have made them liberal endowments out of their lands. <lb/>
            All the knights of Maule have earnestly sought to belong to <lb/>
            their society, and have been admitted faithful members of <lb/>
            their fraternity, that, aided by the prayers of the convent, <lb/>
            they may be the better able to resist the assaults of the evil <lb/>

          <p>“ Thus Hugh, son of Odo, who was distinguished among <lb/>
            his fellow townsmen for wealth and property, gave to the <lb/>

            tithes of his lands in Maule, viz., of corn and wine, of the mill <lb/>
            and oven, of pigs, sheep, geese, wool, hemp, flax, and all <lb/>
            things from which tithes are due. And if his tenants should <lb/>
            plough fresh land, the monks shall have the same tithe as <lb/>
            Hugh himself would have done. His son Paganus-Odo at <lb/>
            first refused to confirm this grant, but afterwards, being <lb/>
            taken prisoner by the French at Mellent, he thought better <lb/>
            of it, and, compelled by the power of God, both he and his <lb/>
            wife Elizabeth and their sons Hugh and Simon absolutely <lb/>
            granted the before mentioned tithes to St. Mary, laying <lb/>
            the deed of gift on the altar in my presence and before my <lb/>
            son Ansold and Peter who was yet a child, and many others. <lb/>
            The monks gave to Paganus ten pounds in pennies, and twenty <lb/>
            shillings to his wife. Also, Adelelm de Gaseran committed <lb/>
            to the monks his son Amauri, with the tithes of Puiseux,1 <lb/>
            granting the tithes to the church for ever, for seven pounds, <lb/>
            if the boy died within seven years. But the boy grew up, <lb/>
            and lived to become a priest, long holding the tithes of Pui­ <lb/>
            seux, and at his death bequeathing them to the monks very <lb/>
            justly, as they had brought him up and carefully educated <lb/>
            him. Also, Hugh the son of Walo, surnamed Fresnil, <lb/>
            before he became a monk, gave three cottier's tene­ <lb/>
            ments2 to St. Mary; and Stephen the son of Gilbert gave <lb/>
            to the monks half a plough-land at Goupillieres ; and although <lb/>
            this did not belong to my fief, I have nevertheless confirmed <lb/>
            the grant by my charter. All these lands and premises, <note type="footnote"> 1 There are two places of this name, one near Pontoise, the. other <lb/>

            whatever gifts my mesne-tenants may make, saving only <lb/>
            their fealty to me and my rights of jurisdiction. Moreover, I <lb/>
            trust that if any one, instigated by the malice of the devil, <lb/>
            should be so envious or perverse as to have the presumption to <lb/>

          <p>The noble person before mentioned confirmed this char­ <lb/>
            ter with his own signature, and gave abbot Mainier seisin <lb/>
            of the afore-mentioned lands in the presence of many credi­ <lb/>
            ble witnesses. There were present his own sons, Ansold, <lb/>
            Theobald, and William, and his sons-in-law Walter de Poissi, <lb/>
            and Baudri de Dreux ; together with the chief men of Maule, <lb/>
            Hugh and Stephen, Walter the priest, and Walter, a knight <lb/>
            whose surname was La Cote, with Richer the provost, Fulk <lb/>
            son of Fulcher, Hugh and Odo sons of Walo, Hervé son of <lb/>
            Everard, and the greatest part of the parishioners of Maule. <lb/>
            Abbot Mainier then appointed Goisbert prior of that cell, <lb/>
            and he shortly afterwards finished the little church which <lb/>
            Godfrey, a priest of great simplicity and innocence, had <lb/>
            begun building. Not long afterwards, the monks gaining <lb/>
            ground both within and without, and the worthy parishioners <lb/>
            rejoicing at their progress, the old church of St. Mary was <lb/>
            taken down, and the foundations of a new and handsome <lb/>
            structure being laid, the work was carried on in an ele­ <lb/>
            gant style of architecture, as occasion offered, for twenty <lb/>
            years, while Goisbert, Guitmond, Roger, and Hugh were <lb/>
            priors.2 Many monks have dwelt there up to the present <lb/>
            day, piously devoted to God's service. <note type="footnote"> I Biothanatis. This word properly signifies those who perish by a <lb/>

            He was much beloved by his tenants and neighbours, because <lb/>
            his manners were frank, and be did not entrench himself <lb/>
            with craft and deceit. His alms were bountiful and he de­ <lb/>
            lighted in the practice, but he had no liking for fasts, and <lb/>
            as far as it was in his power shunned having any thing to do <lb/>
            with them. He was free in giving promises and sometimes <lb/>
            made away with things of value for a worthless price. He <lb/>
            was, at once both covetous and prodigal. It was no <lb/>
            concern of his from whence his good cheer came, nor did he <lb/>
            care whether his means of living were obtained by robbery <lb/>
            or paid for fairly, nor, again, however they were gotten, how <lb/>
            lavishly they were bestowed; so that he had never the com­ <lb/>

            many daughters, Hubeline, Erenburge, Odeline, and Her­ <lb/>

            fortunes, according to God's providence which rules all <lb/>
            things. At last, worn out with age, he died on the second <lb/>
            of the ides [12th] of January, and was buried in the monks' <lb/>
            cloister on the south side of the church.' John of Rheims <lb/>
            wrote his epitaph in these terms:- <lb/>
            Lord PETER, born of noble race, <lb/>
            And heir to lands of boundless space, <lb/>
            Lies buried in his native earth, <lb/>
            Among the tokens of his worth. <lb/>
            But though a knight of high degree, <lb/>
            'Twas not by deeds of chivalry <lb/>
            He won a never dying name; <lb/>
            Such honours blazon not his fame. <lb/>

            (which recall to the Norman observer the nave of Briquebec), belong also <lb/>
            to the older building. The accounts given of churches completely levelled, <lb/>

            He spent his days in revelry. <lb/>
            His liberal bounty never failed, <lb/>
            He lived beloved and died bewailed. <lb/>
            Devotion stirred him, highest praise, <lb/>

          <p>Ansold, Peter's son, was in many respects unlike his <lb/>
            father; his virtues were more eminent, or, to say the least, <lb/>
            they were equal. His disposition was excellent and magna­ <lb/>
            nimous, he was tall and powerful in person, and a most gal­ <lb/>
            lant soldier; he exercised his authority with great dignity, <lb/>
            and his decisions were marked by justice ; he was prompt and <lb/>
            eloquent in argument, and might almost be reckoned a phi­ <lb/>
            losopher. He was a constant attendant at church and <lb/>
            listened with attention to the sacred discourses delivered <lb/>
            there. He studied history in the works of ancient writers, <lb/>
            diligently investigating their learned records, and commit­ <lb/>
            ting the lives of the men of old, which he heard related, to <lb/>
            his tenacious memory. He held in abhorrence unfaithful <lb/>
            narratives, and those who corrupted the word of God, and <lb/>
            were greedy for base gains; and he delighted in publicly con­ <lb/>
            futing dangerous sophisms which might lead astray simple <lb/>
            minds. He paid great respect to his pious mother, Windes­ <lb/>
            moth, and obeyed her in all things like a dutiful son. She <lb/>
            was descended from a noble family in the district of Troyes, <lb/>
            and, surviving her husband, lived nearly fifteen years in <lb/>
            widowhood and devotion to God. Happy mother, whose <lb/>
            old age was solaced in her husband's chamber by the affec­ <lb/>
            tionate care of her son. Having him at her side as her <lb/>
            steadfast supporter, she received there the" last sacraments <lb/>
            and then departed. Being thence conveyed to the tomb <pb n="222"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V. CH. XIX. </note> <lb/>
            with great respect by her loving son, her corpse was in­ <lb/>

            side of the partner of her bed.</p>
          <p>This knight was distinguished in his youth by his noble <lb/>
            acts; for, leaving all his acquaintance, kinsfolk, and relations, <lb/>
            he displayed his innate valour in foreign countries. Italy <lb/>
            was his choice ; where he joined the brave duke Guiscard in <lb/>
            his expedition into Greece, and fought gallantly in the bat­ <lb/>
            tle in which Alexius, emperor of Constantinople, was defeated <lb/>
            and put to flight.1 After a time he was prevailed on, by the <lb/>
            earnest entreaty of his father, to return to France, and he <lb/>
            then married a noble and virtuous young lady, whose name <lb/>
            was Adeline, daughter of Ralph surnamed Malvoisin,2 who <lb/>
            had the castle of Mantes. This man of arms might have <lb/>
            been taken for a model even by persons living under the mo­ <lb/>
            nastic rule ; such was the frugality with which he led all who <lb/>
            associated with him to a prudent course of life, and such the <lb/>
            limits of temperance to which he restricted himself. He <lb/>
            never tasted apples in an orchard, grapes in a vineyard, <lb/>
            or nuts in the woods, taking food only when the table was <lb/>
            spread at regular hours ; for he said that it was the part of a <lb/>
            beast, and not of a man, to eat what chance offered without <lb/>
            regard to time or place. Content with lawful marriage, he <lb/>
            was strictly chaste, and instead of attacking licentiousness and <lb/>
            obscenity like a layman in vulgar phrases, he distinctly con­ <lb/>
            demned it with the pointed observations of a doctor of the <lb/>
            church. Fasting and all bodily abstinence he praised in <lb/>
            others, and resolutely practised himself, so far as it is re­ <lb/>
            quired of a layman. He made no predatory incursions, but <lb/>
            carefully husbanded his own property and the fruit of his <lb/>
            labours; making however the lawful payments of tithes, first- <lb/>
            fruits, and alms which his ancestors had granted to the <lb/>
            servants of God. He not only gave nothing to strollers, <note type="footnote"> 1 This battle was fought near Durazzo, " the western key of the Greek <lb/>

            something in the proper place.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 1106, towards the end of <lb/>
            February, when a comet was seen in the west, emitting a <lb/>
            long and fiery tail,1 Bohemond, the famous duke came to <lb/>
            France after the capture of Antioch, and married Constance, <lb/>
            daughter of Philip, king of France.2 The marriage was <lb/>
            celebrated with great ceremony at Chartres, the Countess <lb/>
            Adela providing every thing necessary with profuse <lb/>
            liberality. At that time the third crusade of the people of <lb/>
            the West to Jerusalem was set on foot, and a vast concourse <lb/>
            of many thousands advanced through Thrace,3 threatening to <lb/>
            tread under foot the Byzantine dynasty. But the righteou­ <lb/>
            providence of God frustrated the enterprises of those who <lb/>
            burned with desire to invade their neighbour's property; so <lb/>
            that this proud gathering of the ambitious missed the prize <lb/>
            which they vainly thought was within their reach. The <lb/>
            same year, three weeks after the comet appeared, Ansold de <lb/>
            Maule, actuated by his fears of divine vengeance, presented <lb/>
            himself humbly in the court held at St. Mary's church, and <lb/>
            with tears of penitence made voluntary satisfaction for some <lb/>
            contentions he had with the monks. He then, in the <lb/>
            presence of all his barons, who were assembled in the monk's <lb/>
            dormitory, granted to the church and St. Mary of Maule all <lb/>
            the lands that his father Peter, and Hugh, Paganus, and <note type="footnote"> 1 It is supposed that this comet is the one which appeared in 1680. It <lb/>

            was more remarkable for its brightness than for the length of its tail. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Antioch was taken by the crusaders in 1098. In 1104 Bohemond <lb/>

            She had been married, in 1101, to Hugh, count of Champagne, and though <lb/>
            divorced on account of nearness of kindred in 1104, the Countess Adela <lb/>

            forfeit his fief for any default, the church should nevertheless <lb/>
            not lose her rights of frank-almoign. Ansold also granted <lb/>
            that the tithe which his sister Hersende received as her mar­ <lb/>
            riage portion, and before her death bad given to St. Mary, by <lb/>
            the delivery of a rod1 into the hand of John, monk and <lb/>
            priest, should, after the death of his nephew Peter freely <lb/>
            belong to the church. He also gave to St. Mary the quarry <lb/>
            of mill-stones in the wood of Beule,2 so that for each mill- <lb/>
            stone two pence should be given towards the lights in the <lb/>
            church, and whoever should defraud the church should forfeit <lb/>
            six pence. Before, sixty pence were paid for an offence of <lb/>
            this description, but as the ecclesiastical law is more humane <lb/>
            than the civil, fifty-five pence were remitted, and only five <lb/>
            taken. Ansold and his wife Adeline, and his two sons Peter <lb/>
            and Ralph, placed the deed of gift of these possessions on <lb/>
            the altar of St. Mary by the side of the missal; at which <lb/>
            ceremony all the knights of Maule were present.</p>
          <p>Ansold declared his eldest son Peter heir to his whole <lb/>
            estates, and the boy received the homage and fealty of all the <lb/>
            knights of Maule, Goscelin de Mareil being their spokes­ <lb/>
            man and scribe. There were present William, Ansold's <lb/>
            brother, and Robert his nephew, the knight Guibold, <lb/>
            son of Ralph Malvoisin, Odo-Paganus son of Hugh, and <lb/>
            Gilbert Fitz-Haimon, Odo son of Walo, and his sons <lb/>
            Peter and Arnulf, Fulk son of Fulcher, and his two <lb/>
            nephews, Geoffrey and Odo, Grimold son of Alman, and <lb/>
            Walter son of Fulk.</p>
          <p>The knight so often mentioned administered justly the <lb/>
            iurisdiction he inherited from his fathers for eighteen <lb/>
            years, being in all things the faithful patron of the monks, <lb/>
            and having daily edifying conferences with them. So far <lb/>
            from diminishing their endowments, he made, as before <note type="footnote"> 1 See note, page 202. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Mill-stone quarries are still worked in this wood, and in other spots in <lb/>

            observed, some augmentations, and his deed of gift is couched <lb/>
            in these terms ;­</p>
          <p>" I, Arnold, do give and confirm all that my father Peter <lb/>
            on behalf of his ancestors, Arnulph and Warm, and his <lb/>
            other relations, gave to God and St. Mary, and the monks <lb/>
            of St. Evroult, in the same manner and form that he granted <lb/>
            the same. The tithes also of Maule, which my two sisters <lb/>
            hold as their marriage dowry, viz., Eremburge the wife of <lb/>
            Baudri de Dreux, and Hersende wife of Hugh de Voisins,1 <lb/>
            if the monks can obtain them from my grandsons either by <lb/>
            gift or bargain, I freely grant as far as concerns myself <lb/>
            and my children. I know that tithes are the portion of <lb/>
            God, and that he thought fit in the old times to retain them, <lb/>
            through Moses, for the support of the Levites. No wise <lb/>
            man can therefore, I think, be ignorant that whosoever <lb/>
            persists in living by such robbery exposes himself to a <lb/>
            terrible retribution hereafter. Moreover, I give the mill- <lb/>
            stone quarry in the wood of Beule2 to St. Mary, in such wise <lb/>
            that two pence be given for each mill-stone towards the <lb/>
            lights of the church. And whoever makes default shall pay <lb/>
            five pence, instead of the sixty hitherto forfeited. Adeline <lb/>
            my wife, and Peter and Ralph my sons, confirm this grant. <lb/>
            In return we have the good offices of the monks, and the privi­ <lb/>
            lege of being associated with them; and in testimony thereof <lb/>
            I have received as a gift from the monks one horse, worth a <lb/>
            hundred shillings, which belonged to Grimold de Saulx­ <lb/>
            marchais. I therefore, with my wife and sons, grant this <lb/>
            charter, by which I freely and without reserve make this <lb/>
            irrevocable donation to the church, that through God's mercy <lb/>
            I may be admitted into the society of the faithful. Amen."</p>
          <p>Germund Rufus of Montfort, when he was dying, gave to <lb/>
            St. Mary and the monks living at Maule the half of all his <lb/>
            possessions in Puisieux, for the repose of his soul, his wife <lb/>
            Eremburge, of whose dowry the land formed a part, and his <lb/>
            sons Hugh and Walter, consenting. It was then appointed <lb/>
            that the heirs who should hold the land should perform all <lb/>
            the service due to the lord in whose fief it was, and the <lb/>
            returns from the woods and the open field should be collected <lb/>
            wherever it was agreed on both sides, and divided in equal <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably Voisins le Bretonneux, to the south-west of Versailles. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See note in the preceding page. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL.

            <note type="margin"> [B. V. CH. XIX. </note> <lb/>
            shares. At that time Hugh de Gacé was prior of Maule, <lb/>
            who stood by with several others when the deed of gift was <lb/>
            placed on the altar of St. Mary, before the corpse of the <lb/>
            deceased was committed to the earth. Afterwards, when <lb/>
            Walter, the son of the before mentioned Germund, was <lb/>
            made a knight, he denied his having agreed to this donation, <lb/>
            asserting that his father had given the land to him before the <lb/>
            gift to the monks. Wherefore the monks went to Amauri, <lb/>
            count de Montfort, and lodged a complaint with him of the <lb/>
            disturbance given them by Walter. The count, taking <lb/>
            jurisdiction of the affair, the following agreement was made <lb/>
            between the disputants. The monks paid the young Walter <lb/>
            forty shillings at Montfort, and he granted them the lands <lb/>
            above mentioned in the. presence of Richelde, Amauri's wife. <lb/>
            On the next Sunday, both brothers, Hugh and Walter, <lb/>
            confirmed the grant at Maule, placing the deed of gift on the <lb/>
            altar, in the presence of David the prior and the rest of the <lb/>
            monks, and of Ansold, and his son Peter, and all the clergy <lb/>
            and people assembled in the church. Afterwards, their <lb/>
            brothers Engenold, and Hervé, made the same grant. This <lb/>
            was done the year that Henry king of England attacked the <lb/>
            castle of St. Clair in France,1 while, on the other hand, <lb/>
            Lewis king of France built the castle of Gani in Normandy, <lb/>
            from whence ensued cruel wars between them, attended with <lb/>
            great losses.</p>
          <p>Nivard de Hargeville gave all his lands of Boinville to the <lb/>
            monks of Maule and half the tithes thereof, for which he <lb/>
            received by the goodwill of the monks twenty-eight shillings. <lb/>
            His brother Simon confirmed the gift, whereupon Hugh the <lb/>
            prior gave him a pair of Cordovan shoes. Peter, also, and <lb/>
            Guarimbold, sons of Nivard, confirmed the gift their father <lb/>
            had made, and each of them received shoes worth six pennies. <lb/>
            On the following Sunday, Nivard came to Maule, and <lb/>
            deposited the deed of gift on the altar before all the parish­ <lb/>
            ioners.</p>
          <p>Geoffrey de Marcq, having taken on himself the monastic <lb/>
            rule at Maule, gave to the monks of St. Evroult the whole <lb/>
            church of Marcq, with half the churchyard and half the <lb/>
            tithes. Emmeline his wife, and their sons William, Simon, <note type="footnote"> 1 Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. The events which are merely alluded to here <lb/>
            are described in the beginning of our author's twelfth book. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            Hugh, Stephen, and Paganus, confirmed the same. After­ <lb/>
            wards Hugh Rufus de Fresnai, under whose fief Geoffrey <lb/>
            held, came to Maule, and, on the petition of the monks, <lb/>
            released what Geoffrey had given from all services ; so that <lb/>
            whether the inheritors of Marcq did their fealty, or made <lb/>
            default in the service due from them, the monks should <lb/>
            for ever hold in frank-almoign. His brother Walter granted <lb/>
            the same.</p>
          <p>Walter, son of Heldeburge, after having received a mortal <lb/>
            wound, gave to the monks at Maile all the tithes which he <lb/>
            had at Puisieux, of the fief of Hervé, son of Everard. His <lb/>
            wife Isemburge, with Walter's three brothers, Richard, <lb/>
            Theobald, and Geoffrey, were present, and ratified the gift. <lb/>
            Hervé also confirmed all the tithes of Puisieux which <lb/>
            belonged to him, and Simon de Toiri gave to the monks that <lb/>
            part of the tithes which was in his lordship. The monks, <lb/>
            also, to satisfy all claims, gave to Hervé one house, with many <lb/>
            chattels, for four pounds in pennies and one arpent of vine­ <lb/>
            yard at La Gard, which Walter, son of Alpes, had given to <lb/>
            St. Mary; and to Adeline his wife, of whose dowry it was <lb/>
            part, one piece of fustian; also to Simon twenty shillings, <lb/>
            and to his wife, of whose inheritance it was part, three <lb/>
            shillings.</p>
          <p>Baldric the Red, of Montfort, on his becoming a monk, <lb/>
            gave to the monks of St. Evroult the rent which he had at <lb/>
            Mantes, viz. ten shillings and a sestary of salt.1 The monks <lb/>
            Fécamp, who had a cell at Mantes, paid this at the feast <lb/>
            of St. Remi. Baldric also gave whatever interest be had in <lb/>
            the church and tithes of Jumeauville, and twelve pence, <lb/>
            which the sons of Burge paid him for quit-rent of a farm <lb/>
            called La Concie. His wife also confirmed this, and received <lb/>
            for it one cow. Geoffrey his son also granted the same to <lb/>
            the monks, and received from them a horse worth sixty <lb/>
            shillings, and also twenty shillings in money. The sure <lb/>
            witnesses were Ansold, lord of Maule, and Peter his son, <lb/>
            Geoffrey, son of Richer, and Grimold, son of Alman, <lb/>
            Amauri Floënel, and many others. On the death of Baldric, <lb/>
            his son disputed the property, but, in consideration of <lb/>
            twenty shillings more, paid to him, he renewed the grant. <lb/>
            In consequence, he went to Mantes with David the prior, <note type="footnote"> 1 A measure holding about a pint and a half, or twenty-four ounces. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. CH.XIX. </note> <lb/>
            and gave directions to the monks of Fecamp, who lived at <lb/>
            St. George, that they should pay yearly to the monks of <lb/>
            Maule the six shillings and sestary of salt which they used <lb/>
            to pay to his father. Also, William, son of Henry de <lb/>
            Richebourg, in whose lordship it was, granted it to the <lb/>
            monks, and he received from them ten shillings and half a <lb/>
            muid of wine as a gratuity.</p>
          <p>Eremburge, daughter of Peter de Maule, and Amauri her <lb/>
            son restored to the church the moiety of the tithes which <lb/>
            they had unjustly detained, and deposited the deed of gift <lb/>
            on the altar of St. Mary, mother of God, before all the <lb/>
            people. The lord Ansold, the proposer and faithful upholder <lb/>
            of this grant, was present, and confirmed it, with his sons <lb/>
            Peter and Ralph. Then the monks, to redeem the tithes, <lb/>
            which were mortgaged to William de Maule for twenty <lb/>
            pounds, gave ten pounds to Eremburge, and granted three <lb/>
            arpents of vineyard to him and his heir. But when Erem­ <lb/>
            burge took the veil, she and the forenamed Amauri, her <lb/>
            son, gave their part of the aforesaid tithes to God, and <lb/>
            deposited the deed of gift on the altar as before, by the side <lb/>
            of the gospels. There were present William de Maule, and <lb/>
            Robert his nephew, and Geoffrey his brother-in-law, with <lb/>
            Odo-Paganus, and Odo, son of Walo, and Fulk the clerk, <lb/>
            and Geoffrey, son of Richer, who gave thanks to God, who <lb/>
            had delivered this woman from the fatal burden of an impious <lb/>
            rapacity.</p>
          <p>Thus the priory at Maule grew rich by the address of its <lb/>
            occupants and the gifts of those who flocked to it; but it <lb/>
            suffered a great loss in the death of Ansold its worthy <lb/>
            patron. Having borne arms for fifty-three years, old age <lb/>
            coming on, he fell sick, and having lingered for nearly seven <lb/>
            weeks, prepared himself for appearing before the judgment­ <lb/>
            seat of the Most High by confession and penitence. He <lb/>
            did not take to his bed, but went daily to the offices of the <lb/>
            church, and retained complete possession of his faculty of <lb/>
            memory and gift of speech, but, notwithstanding, he was <lb/>
            sensible of the entire decay of the bodily powers, from <lb/>
            which physicians prognosticate that men will either sink or <lb/>
            rally, and that there was no escaping the imminent approach <lb/>
            of death. Anxious, therefore, for the salvation of his soul, <lb/>
            he turned to the Lord with all his heart, and applied himself <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1118.] </note> <lb/>
            zealously to fulfil what wise men had taught him, and he had <lb/>
            carefully committed to memory. In consequence, hearing <lb/>
            one night the church bell, he got up and went to the church, <lb/>
            attended by one faithful servant, and prayed to God to <lb/>
            accept his offering, and to accomplish his desires. When <lb/>
            matins were ended, he summoned the monks to his side, and, <lb/>
            opening his mind to them, entreated them to admit him <lb/>
            into their brotherhood. David was then prior, and there <lb/>
            were with him the worthy monks and priests John of <lb/>
            Rheims, Osbern, and Odo. With these it was Ansold's <lb/>
            fervent desire to be associated in their monastic habit, as <lb/>
            well as in spirit; saying, that he had now divested himself <lb/>
            of all concern about his wife and children, that he had done <lb/>
            with worldly power and possessions, that death was near, <lb/>
            and his only desire was to draw closer to God, and that his <lb/>
            request ought not to be refused. The monks rejoiced much <lb/>
            at hearing his pious wishes, but deferred acceding to them <lb/>
            for two days, in consequence of the absence of his eldest <lb/>
            son and heir. Ansold bore the delay with impatience, so <lb/>
            eager was his desire for the spiritual rewards which the <lb/>
            Master of the household reserves for his watching servants. <lb/>
            He declared that all he wished and hoped for was to live <lb/>
            and die with the poor in Christ, that he might be a partaker <lb/>
            in the promises which God has made to such his children. <lb/>
            The two days being elapsed, he summoned his son and his <lb/>
            wife to his presence, and giving many directions to his son <lb/>
            before several knights, thus addressed him in the hearing of <lb/>
            a number of persons of both sexes and different ages:­</p>
          <p>“ My dearly beloved son, whom I have brought up with <lb/>
            great care, that I might leave an heir and successor accept­ <lb/>
            able to God and man, lay up carefully in your memory what <lb/>
            I am about to say to you very seriously. In the first place, <lb/>
            love God at all times and before all things. Fear and <lb/>
            honour your bishop and king as your earthly superiors, and <lb/>
            endeavour to obey their commands as far as in you lies. <lb/>
            Pray daily to God for their prosperity, that by the watchful <lb/>
            care and merits of your excellent bishop, your soul may <lb/>
            obtain eternal salvation, and under the government of a <lb/>
            peaceful king you may enjoy your temporal possessions in <lb/>
            quietness and security. Extend to your liege-men the pro­ <lb/>
            tection which you owe them, ruling them, not as a tyrant, <pb n="230"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. CH. XIX. </note> <lb/>
            but as a gentle master. Maintain, prudently, the rights <lb/>
            belonging to your fief, whether in fields, woods, meadows, or <lb/>
            vineyards, and be careful not to diminish them by impru­ <lb/>
            dent grants. Meddle not with the property of others, and <lb/>
            have nothing to do with thieves and robbers. Guard your <lb/>
            own substance by lawful means, and beware of laying vio­ <lb/>
            lent hands on that of other people. From thence arises <lb/>
            anger, then quarrels; robbery, fire and slaughter follow, <lb/>
            with other evils too numerous to mention. A prudent man <lb/>
            will be on his guard against those causes of mischief which <lb/>
            he sees affecting others. Observe well these my last injunc­ <lb/>
            tions. Always love and frequent our holy mother church. <lb/>
            Daily listen to the word of God, the food and life of our <lb/>
            souls, and attend the mass and other divine offices. Honour <lb/>
            the servants of God both by word and deed, and more <lb/>
            especially venerate and support the monks, our masters and <lb/>
            brothers, who are the ministers of this church, to the <lb/>
            utmost of your power; assisting them both by your advice <lb/>
            and your exertions, as occasion may require. Freely confirm <lb/>
            them in the peaceable possession of the estates which my <lb/>
            father and I have granted them for the good of our souls. <lb/>
            Do not encroach on their lands and revenues, nor suffer any <lb/>
            of your tenants to injure them. If you study to show your­ <lb/>
            self their firm adherent, their prayers to God for you will <lb/>
            be constant. Never, then, have any ill-will towards them, <lb/>
            or be jealous of their wealth, but treat them kindly, and, if <lb/>
            the Lord shall give you length of days and prosperity, aug­ <lb/>
            ment it. If you observe and do what I command you, I <lb/>
            give you, in the name of God, the blessing which our fore­ <lb/>
            fathers left to their heirs, earnestly beseeching Him, that it <lb/>
            may descend and rest upon you. But if you should do <lb/>
            otherwise, which God forbid, I leave you my curse, by the <lb/>
            authority of God and the holy fathers."</p>
          <p>Having concluded this exhortation to his son, the excel­ <lb/>
            lent lord thus addressed his wife Adeline: " My sweet sister <lb/>
            and amiable wife, Adeline, I pray you lend a favourable ear <lb/>
            to my requests. Thus far we have faithfully kept our mar­ <lb/>
            riage vows, and by God's help have lived together more <lb/>
            than twenty years without quarrels and shameful conten­ <lb/>
            tions. Worthy offspring have been born to us in lawful <lb/>
            wedlock, and you must lead them by your earnest admo- <pb n="231"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1118.] </note> <lb/>
            nitions to obey their Maker's will. My end is approaching, <lb/>
            and whether I will or not, I am near at death's door. I am <lb/>
            going the way of all flesh, and have to pay the common debt <lb/>
            of nature. I am unwilling to trouble you with a long dis­ <lb/>
            course. Your life may serve as a lesson to numbers, add <lb/>
            one more to your good works, and henceforth live chastely <lb/>
            in holy widowhood. Grant me also your permission to be­ <lb/>
            come a monk, and, quitting the showy garments belonging <lb/>
            to my worldly estate, put on the black robe of our holy <lb/>
            father Benedict. It is my desire to be admitted into the <lb/>
            society of those who relinquish the delights of the world for <lb/>
            Christ's sake. Release me therefore I pray you, my lady, <lb/>
            from the bonds of marriage, and commend me earnestly to <lb/>
            God, that, relieved from all secular ties, I may be in a con­ <lb/>
            dition to receive the monastic habit and the tonsure. I ask <lb/>
            this from the bottom of my heart; this is the object of my <lb/>
            most earnest wishes, that my soul may be numbered in the <lb/>
            company of the monks, and, renewed by being invested with <lb/>
            the religious garb, may sing in the present life, ' I am black, <lb/>
            but comely.’1 I am black because I wear a dark, shapeless, <lb/>
            and coarse robe, but comely because it covers the humility <lb/>
            of a holy purpose, and a devotion well pleasing to God."</p>
          <p>When Ansold had concluded his discourse to this pur­ <lb/>
            pose, his good wife, who had never resisted his will and now <lb/>
            obeyed her husband as she was wont, granted his request <lb/>
            with a respectful modesty, shedding a flood of tears, though <lb/>
            she did not give way to noisy lamentations. At that <lb/>
            season holy church was celebrating the eve of our Lord's <lb/>
            nativity, and there was a violent tempest which shook, the <lb/>
            world, overthrowing woods, houses, and other buildings, and <lb/>
            did much damage both by sea and land, to the great terror <lb/>
            of mankind. Leave having been given, the novice was ton­ <lb/>
            sured, and put on the religious habit, in which, having worn <lb/>
            it three days, he was also buried, that in it he might rise <lb/>
            again. On the third day, finding that death was near, he <lb/>
            caused his brethren to be summoned, and begged them to <lb/>
            recite the prayers for the dying. When they were ended, <lb/>
            he asked for holy water and a crucifix. On their being <lb/>
            brought, he sprinkled himself with holy water, and bowing <lb/>
            before the crucifix, thus commended himself to Him who <note type="footnote"> 1 Canticles i. 5. </note> <pb n="232"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V. CH.XIX. </note> <lb/>
            hung on the cross, adopting the words which had been used <lb/>
            by some man of wisdom: " Lord God, I, once a sinner but <lb/>
            now a penitent, commend my spirit into thy hands as a ser­ <lb/>
            vant should submit to his master." With these words he <lb/>
            expired, as we believe, happily. Then vigils were chanted <lb/>
            and psalms and prayers said, and masses solemnly per­ <lb/>
            formed, with much grief for his decease. All which being <lb/>
            duly performed, on the day when the feast of the assumption <lb/>
            of St. John was kept by the church,1 his body was com­ <lb/>
            mitted to the earth, the mother of all, to be preserved and <lb/>
            given up again. <unclear>Odo</unclear> of Montreuil assisted at the funeral, <lb/>
            performing what belonged to the priest's office, and has <lb/>
            comprehended in a short notice, his name and rank, and the <lb/>
            day of his death, with a devout prayer on his behalf. <lb/>
            Stranger, dost thou wish to know <lb/>
            Who lies buried here below ? <lb/>
            ANSOLD was his name, a knight <lb/>
            Once the foremost in the fight. <lb/>
            Six days 'fore the year begun <lb/>
            Its due course of time to run, <lb/>
            He was summoned to his rest: <lb/>
            God reward him with the blest!</p>
          <p>[1118—1128.] Peter, who now became lord of Maule, was <lb/>
            distinguished for his conduct in war and made himself for­ <lb/>
            midable to his neighbours, but in some of his doings he did <lb/>
            did not follow his father's steps. For he was led by youth­ <lb/>
            ful levity to delight in players and gamblers, and listening <lb/>
            to the persuasions of the young men about him engaged in <lb/>
            rapine, and frequently oppressed the cultivators of his own <lb/>
            domains and those of others. He ravaged without mercy <lb/>
            his neighbour's property and foolishly wasted his own. <lb/>
            Hence, while he inflicted great evils on the inhabitants of <lb/>
            other villages, the freebooters of the neighbourhood took <lb/>
            every opportunity of making secret inroads on him and <lb/>
            his tenants. When in a passion, his threats were severe, <lb/>
            when he was pleased, he rashly made promises which were <lb/>
            difficult to be performed; so that he was often false in both. <lb/>
            After his father's death, he married a wife of a very noble <note type="footnote"> 1 It appears before, in book ii. c. vi. (vol. i. p. 247) that our author adopted <lb/>

            family, Ada, niece of Bouchard de Montmorenci and daugh­ <lb/>
            ter of the Count de Guines.1 As far as words go, he pays <lb/>
            due respect to the monks and clergy, and takes their re­ <lb/>
            proofs in good part, veiling his follies under the excuse of <lb/>
            his youth, and promising to amend his life in riper years, <lb/>
            which may God grant! I will now give a short account of <lb/>
            the possessions which were given to the monks by him, or <lb/>
            in his fief.</p>
          <p>Ansold, before he died, bequeathed his best palfrey to the <lb/>
            monks, in lieu of which, Peter gave them, at his father's re­ <lb/>
            quest, the land of Montmarcien; and at the same time he <lb/>
            confirmed to them all that his predecessors had granted. <lb/>
            John de St. Denis, and Mary his wife, and Arnulf their son, <lb/>
            had freely given to St. Mary the vineyard of Clairfont, but <lb/>
            afterwards, undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, they sold <lb/>
            it to a certain Breton of Montfort named Fulk, notwith­ <lb/>
            standing the claims of the monks. The Breton being <lb/>
            disseized of it by a sentence of the bishop, it fell into <lb/>
            Peter's hands, but Providence shortly afflicting him with <lb/>
            disease, on making his confession he restored it to St. Mary <lb/>
            discharged of all quit-rent. He also gave the crop of grapes <lb/>
            that year to purchase an image of the holy Virgin.</p>
          <p>Grimold, nephew and heir of Stephen de Maule, gave to <lb/>
            the monks all the tithes of his lands, both in the lordship of <lb/>
            Ansold and in that of Paganus, together with the tithes of <lb/>
            his mill and vineyards, and, together with Petronilla his <lb/>
            wife, deposited the deed of gift on the altar. Afterwards, <lb/>
            on her death, he granted to the monks two arpents of land <lb/>
            at Montjubert, and added a third in the same place at his <lb/>
            daughter's obit. He went to Jerusalem with Stephen <lb/>
            Count de Blois,2 and, having undergone many sufferings in <lb/>
            that expedition, lived uprightly after his return.</p>
          <p>Gerald, . surnamed La Cote, Grimold's brother-in-law, <lb/>
            falling sick, was so terrified by the divine chastisement, that <lb/>
            he gave to the monks certain tithes which he possessed in <lb/>
            the territory of Marole, and his part of the churchyard of <lb/>
            the same village ; his wife, part of whose dowry it was, con- <note type="footnote"> 1 A.D. about 1091—1137. He married Ada, daughter of Manasseh, <lb/>
            count of Guines (about 1091-1137), and Emma de Tankerville, widow <lb/>
            of Odo of Folkstone. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See before, note, p. 182. </note> <pb n="234"/>

            senting, as well as Peter, lord of Maule, in whose fief it was. <lb/>
            Aubrey de Marole, also, gave to the monks twelve acres of <lb/>
            land on the brow of the hill to the west of Marole.</p>
          <p>Odo, son of Walo, an honourable knight, at the death of <lb/>
            his son Arnulf, gave to the monks of Maule three acres of <lb/>
            land which were at that time cultivated by Fulk the priest. <lb/>
            He also gave them three muids of wine, and granted the <lb/>
            same quantity to be furnished yearly out of his vineyards ; <lb/>
            so that the church should not lose the endowment in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of any succession or change of the heirs of Maule; <lb/>
            and the monks were constantly to make due prayers for the <lb/>
            souls of his sons Peter, Arnulf, Milo, and his other friends. <lb/>
            It happened a few days afterwards that Odo fell sick, and <lb/>
            wishing, like a good son, to reap profit from the visitation <lb/>
            by his father's rod, he called together his wife Beliarde, <lb/>
            his daughter-in-law Cornelia, his daughter Cicily, and his <lb/>
            son-in-law Godfrey, and with their consent gave the whole <lb/>
            of his tithes to God and St. Mary. The aforesaid women <lb/>
            and Godfrey, by Odo's command, then went to the church <lb/>
            and laid the donation on the altar. After this was done, <lb/>
            his sickness increasing, he became a monk there and lay in <lb/>
            the monks' infirmary ten days. Meanwhile, alter the <lb/>
            Bold, his son, hastening from Troyes, where he had long dwelt, <lb/>
            found his father alive. At his request he confirmed what <lb/>
            his father and relations had given to the church of God; <lb/>
            viz., three acres of land, two muids of wine yearly, and all <lb/>
            the tithes his father possessed, whether of corn, wine, or first- <lb/>
            fruits. All which, after his father was dead and buried, Walter <lb/>
            granted by an instrument which was laid by a book on the <lb/>
            altar of St. Mary, mother of God; and, in imitation of his <lb/>
            father, has been a good neighbour to the monks to the <lb/>
            present time.</p>
          <p>In the time of Hugh de Gacé, David, and other priors, who <lb/>
            laboured usefully at Maule, it was commonly well known, <lb/>
            and I wish it to be handed down to posterity, that Tesza, <lb/>
            wife of Bernard the Blind, gave to the monks of St. Evroult <lb/>
            dwelling at Maule, one moiety of the farm of St. Columb, <lb/>
            both plain and wood, besides two arpents of land which he <lb/>
            also gave them, that they might build a house and have cot­ <lb/>
            tages without any one's interfering with them. He did this <lb/>
            with the assent of his lords, Gosceline, who held the other <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            moiety of the land in demesne, because of default in the <lb/>
            services due, and Guaszo de Poissi, who was the chief lord. <lb/>
            The monks at different times gave large sums to these lords, <lb/>
            hoping to increase the property of the church by legitimate <lb/>
            means, and secure advantages for their successors. Hugh, <lb/>
            who was enterprising and magnanimous, began the affair <lb/>
            when he was prior, giving to Tesza, beforenamed, ten shil­ <lb/>
            lings, and a piece of fustian to her son Odo, and ten <lb/>
            shillings to her son-in-law William. He also gave to <lb/>
            Gosceline one horse of the value of four pounds, to his wife <lb/>
            twenty shillings, and to Guaszo twenty-five shillings, with a <lb/>
            horn cup, and another to his wife. These things and others <lb/>
            they received from the generosity of the monks, and made a <lb/>
            firm deed of gift, which they deposited on the altar before <lb/>
            many witnesses. But they afterwards iniquitously falsified <lb/>
            their engagements in various ways : especially, Guaszo, the <lb/>
            most powerful among them, who ought to have corrected <lb/>
            the others if they went astray, disturbed the endowment, <lb/>
            pillaged the cottiers, and destroyed their houses; so that <lb/>
            the place became waste as it was before, and the monks <lb/>
            were compelled for the present to abandon the spot. Some <lb/>
            years afterwards Amauri, son of Guaszo, was slain: the <lb/>
            monks then went to him while he was in tribulation for the <lb/>
            death of his son, and requested him to abate the injury he <lb/>
            had done them. Softened by his affliction, he made a <lb/>
            humble reply, promising to cure the evil he had done. He <lb/>
            therefore committed the affair to Gosceline and Amauri de <lb/>
            Beauvoir, to whom he had lately restored the fief, and of <lb/>
            whom Gosceline then held it. They in consequence met at <lb/>
            Fresnes, and treated respecting the adjustment of the busi­ <lb/>
            ness, and at the demand of Guaszo and the monks, Amauri <lb/>
            confirmed the grant which Tesza had made, and Guaszo and <lb/>
            Gosceline had ratified. By common agreement, therefore, of <lb/>
            all parties, Amauri and Gosceline publicly enfeoffed the <lb/>
            monks in the presence and hearing of Grimold de Maule and <lb/>
            Roger his son, and many others. Finally, Amauri came to <lb/>
            Maule on a day appointed, and deposited on the altar of <lb/>
            St. Mary the donation which he had made at Fresnes, re­ <lb/>
            ceiving from the generosity of the monks twenty shillings <lb/>
            of Mantes.</p>
          <p>In this manner the cell at Maule rose through the <pb n="236"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. CH. XIX. </note> <lb/>
            exertions of careful monks, and was suitably endowed by the <lb/>
            generous contributions of its supporters, to the praise of <lb/>
            God. The place was well situated for vineyards and fertile <lb/>
            fields, and watered by the river Mauldre,1 which has its <lb/>
            course through them. It is well protected by a number of <lb/>
            noble knights. These give freely to the church, during their <lb/>
            lives, of their lands and substance, and the order of monks is <lb/>
            treated by them with great respect; and at the hour of death <lb/>
            their aid is earnestly sought for the salvation of their souls. <lb/>
            The knights frequent the monk's cloister, and confer with <lb/>
            them on practical and theoretical subjects. Thus it is the <lb/>
            school of the living, and the refuge of the dying.</p>
          <p>In the time of Peter the elder, Abbot Mainier went to the <lb/>
            court of King Philip, and humbly sought his confirmation of <lb/>
            the grants which had been made to the monks of St. <lb/>
            Evroult of possessions in France. The king not only <lb/>
            graciously ratified all the endowments already made, but <lb/>
            kindly and cheerfully exhorted those who were about him to <lb/>
            further gifts. This took place on the road between Epone <lb/>
            and Mantes. Afterwards, in the time of Peter the younger, <lb/>
            King Lewis came to Maule, and, being incensed with Peter <lb/>
            on account of some excesses he had committed in the <lb/>
            insolence of youth, razed the fortified wall with which the <lb/>
            prudent Ansold had surrounded his house, and demolished <lb/>
            the house itself. The king accepted the hospitality of the <lb/>
            monks at the priory, and confirmed to them by his royal <lb/>
            charter all that had been given them, or they had purchased, <lb/>
            in the time of the three lords, Peter, Ansold, and the other <lb/>
            Peter. Warm of Séez, a prudent and learned monk was <lb/>
            then prior, and made use of his attendance upon, and <lb/>
            familiar intercourse with, the king, to obtain his sanction to <lb/>
            all the endowments of that cell which had been procured by <lb/>
            Goisbert, and Guitmond, William, and Hugh, David, and <lb/>
            Ralph, and other priors. This may suffice for what I have <lb/>
            to say of Maule in the present book.</p>

          <p>GOISBERT, the famous physician, having laid the foundations <lb/>
            of the church at Maule, as we have before related, consulted <note type="footnote"> 1 A rivulet which falls into the Seine near Epone, not far from Mantes. </note> <lb/>

            some of his acquaintances and friends for the common good <lb/>
            of his own monastery. With their concurrence he earnestly <lb/>
            entreated his abbot to entrust the priory of Maule to fresh <lb/>
            hands, in order that he might be free to prosecute other <lb/>
            affairs. This was done; Guitmond, who had been a priest at <lb/>
            Soulangi,1 an excellent man, being appointed in his place, <lb/>
            while the physician made pressing instances to several <lb/>
            French knights on behalf of his brethren. Some he gained <lb/>
            by his medicinal care and assistance, others by presents, and <lb/>
            all by his eloquent discourse.</p>
          <p>Humphrey, surnamed Harenc, and Havise his wife, and <lb/>
            the sons of the same Havise, Paganus, Alexander, and Roger <lb/>
            de Rolleboise, with his wife Basile and her soil Guiard, <lb/>
            gave to God and St. Evroult the church of St. Villegast, <lb/>
            with the tithes thereto belonging, and one plough-land. <lb/>
            They also gave the herbage of the whole vill, free from any <lb/>
            commonage, and all the land in the parish, whether in grass <lb/>
            or tillage,2 to be cultivated by the tenants settled there, <lb/>
            reserving only the champarty3 to himself. This grant was <lb/>
            made before the lord Robert at Ivri, and was confirmed by <lb/>
            him and his sons Ascelin, Goël, and William. He granted <lb/>
            all that he had in the same vill, for which he received the <lb/>
            seignory of the place and an ounce of gold. Not long after­ <lb/>

            ance, and was a long time eminent among his neighbours <lb/>
            for his gallant actions. He built a very strong castle at <lb/>
            Breval, and filled it with fierce freebooters who ruined num­ <lb/>
            bers. He surprised the castle of Ivri by a skilful stratagem, <lb/>

            The same Ascelin, in the monks' house at Hillier, released <lb/>
            to the monks of St. Evroult all tolls for passage, as well in <lb/>
            that lordship as in all his other lands. Robert and William, <lb/>
            surnamed Louvel, his sons, afterwards confirmed the grant, <lb/>
            and strictly observed its tenor for a long time.</p>
          <p>Hugh Paganus, Grosse-Langue, with his wife Agnes, and <lb/>
            his son Guy, granted to St. Evroult the viscounty, that is, <lb/>
            the voierie,1 as much as they had in Villegast, from which <lb/>
            the monks received at one time ten shillings and a <lb/>
            deer-skin, at another time twenty shillings. The son <lb/>
            received ten shillings of Mantes for his release. John of <lb/>
            Rheims wrote out the charter of this covenant before the <lb/>
            tower of Breval, Hugh Fresnel dictating it; and Hugh <lb/>
            Paganus and his sons confirmed it. Some time afterwards <lb/>
            Hugh became a monk, and his sons Rodolph, Simon, and <lb/>
            Robert, attempted to deprive the monks of the viscounty; <lb/>
            but they, to hold their possessions in peace, gave to Rodolph, <lb/>
            the eldest, one hundred and ten shillings of money of <lb/>
            Mantes, to Simon five shillings, and to Robert, Cordovan <lb/>
            shoes.</p>

            to St. Evroult, in the presence of Robert de St. Nicholas, <lb/>
            a field belonging to the farm of a certain villein named <lb/>
            Robert, although he complained that he had not land sum­ <lb/>
            cient for one plough. Fulk de St. Aubin having given part <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE human mind has continual need of being usefully <lb/>
            exercised, so that it may be well directed in a virtuous <lb/>
            course for the future, by its researches into the annals of <lb/>
            the past, and its observation on what is passing around. <lb/>
            It is every man's duty to be daily learning how he ought to <lb/>
            live, by having the examples of ancient worthies ever present <lb/>
            before his eyes, and profiting thereby. It sometimes happens <lb/>
            that many events present themselves to the ignorant as <lb/>
            unheard-of things, and new circumstances are frequently <lb/>
            occurring in modern times on which no light can be thrown <lb/>
            to inexperienced minds but by reference to former transac­ <lb/>
            tions. Studious persons therefore inquire into the obscure <lb/>
            passages of history with anxious care, and set a high value <lb/>
            on whatever can profit a well-disposed mind. Animated in <lb/>
            their labours by this good design, they unfold the past to <lb/>
            posterity with perfect impartiality, while, notwithstanding <lb/>
            their ability, senseless men snarl at their works and tear <lb/>
            them in pieces with their currish fangs. Smarting under <lb/>
            such attacks, even wise men sometimes flag in their energies, <lb/>
            abandoning their undertakings and shutting themselves up <lb/>
            in perpetual silence. Thus it happens that from some frivo­ <lb/>
            lous circumstance, the world suffers a lamentable loss. If <lb/>
            this were not irreparable, and a kindly-feeling posterity could <lb/>
            recover what it had lost, it would shake off its indifference <lb/>
            and joyfully rouse itself to gather with eagerness the flowers <lb/>
            and the fruit of the labours thus subjected to malicious <lb/>
            attacks, and to study them with lively and careful attention. <lb/>
            We often find complaints of this sort in ancient writers, and <lb/>
            unite with our illustrious masters in their lamentations over <lb/>
            the injuries heaped upon them by their envious contempo­ <lb/>
            raries. We hear St. Jerome and Origen, and other doctors <lb/>
            of the church complaining in their works of the cavils of <lb/>
            scurrilous critics, and it is a cause of regret that on this <lb/>
            account we have been deprived of many important commu­ <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            nications ; able men preferring to rest in peace rather than <lb/>
            employ their talents in skilfully treating difficult subjects, <lb/>
            when by so doing they exposed themselves to malicious <lb/>
            attacks. Let those, I beg and entreat, observe silence, who <lb/>
            neither produce any thing of their own, nor accept the <lb/>
            labours of others in a friendly spirit, nor correct with temper <lb/>
            any thing which dissatisfies them. Let them learn what they <lb/>
            are ignorant of, and if they are incapable of learning, at least <lb/>
            let them suffer their fellow disciples to publish what they <lb/>
            think right.</p>
          <p>The primitive state and the fall of man, the revolutions of <lb/>
            the passing age, the vicissitudes in the lives of our prelates <lb/>
            and princes, the events of peace and war, and the never­ <lb/>
            ending chances which affect mankind, offer a vast field for <lb/>
            any writer to expatiate on. As for miracles and wonders <lb/>
            wrought by the saints, they are now of such rare occurrence <lb/>
            in the world that authors have little need of bestowing <lb/>
            much attention on stories of that kind. Time was when <lb/>
            our ancient fathers, Martial and Taurinus, Silvester, Martin <lb/>
            and Nicholas, and other admirable men, whose tongues were <lb/>
            the keys of heaven, and who were full of supernatural graces <lb/>
            and gifts, shone in the church like the light of the sun, and <lb/>
            in the power of the Almighty gave laws to the elements of <lb/>
            nature and the power of the air; but these now enjoy the <lb/>
            rest of the blessed with their heavenly King, from whom they <lb/>
            have received everlasting rewards. Their present successors, <lb/>
            who are raised to the summit of power, and, sitting in Moses' <lb/>
            seat are called Rabbi, while they revel in worldly riches and <lb/>
            pomp, of which most of them are too fond, are far from <lb/>
            being equally illustrious as their predecessors for the merits <lb/>
            of sanctity and miraculous powers and influences. Still we <lb/>
            may faithfully relate the revolutions of the world and the <lb/>
            course of human events, and history can be made the vehicle <lb/>
            for the praise of Him who is the Maker and righteous <lb/>
            Governor of all things. The eternal Creator works without <lb/>
            ceasing and disposes all things in a wonderful order; let <lb/>
            every one treat devoutly of those glorious acts, according as <lb/>
            his inclination and ability prompt him and as he shall be <lb/>
            divinely instigated. <note type="footnote"> TOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note> <pb n="242"/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1066, the fifth indiction, the race <lb/>
            of the great king Edgar having so degenerated that none of <lb/>
            his descendants were able to sustain the weight of the royal <lb/>
            sceptre, William, duke of Normandy, crossed over to England <lb/>
            with many thousand troops, and on the field of Senlac slew <lb/>
            Harold the usurper of the English throne. Soon afterwards <lb/>
            on Christmas day, he was crowned at Westminster by Aldred <lb/>
            arch bishop of York, with the acclamations of both Normans <lb/>
            and English, and governed the kingdom of England with a strong <lb/>
            hand twenty years, eight months and sixteen days. 1 Under <lb/>
            his rule the native inhabitants were crushed, imprisoned, <lb/>
            disinherited, banished and scattered beyond the limits of <lb/>
            their own country; while his own vassals and adherents <lb/>
            were exalted to wealth and honours and raised to all <lb/>
            the offices of the state. Among these Hugh D'Av­ <lb/>
            ranches, son of Richard surnamed Goz, was highly dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished among the chief nobility, and invested with the <lb/>
            earldom of Chester by the advice of the king's counsel after <lb/>
            Gerbod of Flanders had returned home.2 This Hugh was <lb/>
            fondly attached to the world and worldly pomps, in which <lb/>
            he considered the highest portion of human happiness to <lb/>
            consist. He was a brave soldier, lavish in his liberalities, <lb/>
            and took great delight in riotous sports, in jesters, horses <lb/>
            and dogs, with other vanities of that sort. He was always <lb/>
            surrounded by a numerous household, in which a crowd of <lb/>
            young men of all ranks both low and high continually <lb/>
            revelled. But the earl also entertained about him many <lb/>
            honourable men, clerks as well as knights, and was well <lb/>
            pleased to share with them both his cares and his riches. <lb/>
            Attached to his chapel was a clerk from Avranches, named <lb/>
            Gerald,3 who was eminent for piety and virtue as well as <lb/>
            for learning. This chaplain performed daily the service of <lb/>
            God and frequently celebrated the holy offering with great <lb/>
            devotion. He used his best offices with the courtiers of his <note type="footnote"> 1 December 25, 1066—September 9, 1087. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Our author has given some further particulars of Hugh d'Avranches, <lb/>

            lord, by setting before them the example of those who had <lb/>
            gone before, to move them to amendment of life. He observ­ <lb/>
            ed in many, and justly condemned, their headstrong tendency <lb/>
            to carnal pursuits, and mourned over the neglect of divine <lb/>
            worship generally shown. Great barons, simple knights, and <lb/>
            noble youths all received their share of his salutary admoni­ <lb/>
            tions, and he drew both from the Old Testament and the <lb/>
            more recent Christian records copious accounts of holy <lb/>
            warriors who were worthy of their imitation. He described <lb/>
            with eloquence the combats of Demetrius and George, The­ <lb/>
            odore and Sebastian, of Maurice, tribune of the Theban legion, <lb/>
            and Eustachius, the illustrious commander of the forces, <lb/>
            with his comrades, who obtained heaven by the crown of <lb/>
            martyrdom. 1 To these he added the history of William the <lb/>
            noble champion, who after a long military service renounced <lb/>
            the world and gloriously fought the fight of faith under the <lb/>

            But as the bearer was in haste to depart and the severe <lb/>

            abridgment on my tablets,1 which I now hasten to transfer <lb/>
            correctly to parchment and thus spread abroad the fame of <lb/>
            the brave lord-marcher.</p>
          <p>In the time of Pepin, king of the Franks, count Theodoric3 <lb/>
            had by his wife Aldana a son named William. The boy <lb/>
            was taught letters from his childhood, and afterwards took <lb/>
            arms in the service of Charlemagne. He obtained the title and <lb/>
            office of a count and the command of the first cohort in the <lb/>
            army. Charles afterwards made him duke of Aquitain,3 and <lb/>
            confided to him an expedition against king Theodebald,4 the <lb/>
            Spaniards and Saracens. Having lost no time in marching <lb/>
            into Septimania, he crossed the Rhone and laid siege to the <lb/>
            city of Orange which he reduced, defeating the invaders. <lb/>
            He then fought many battles with the infidels from beyond <lb/>
            sea and the Arabs of the neighbourhood, his sword, by God's <lb/>
            help, giving safety to the faithful, enlarging the bounds of <note type="footnote"> are preserved in the Royal Library at Paris. See description of the MSS. <lb/>

            the present book. The climate of Normandy does not appear to have <lb/>
            been much improved since he wrote, for even at a recent period Mr. St. <lb/>
            John, in his entertaining journal of a residence near Caen, describes the <lb/>
            winter to have been so severe as to have often incapacitated him for literary <lb/>
            occupation, much in the same terms as Ordericus used eight hundred years <lb/>
            before. The nature and scarcity of the fuel must, doubtless, have added <lb/>
            to the distress. Our author seems to indicate that the frost interfered less <lb/>
            with his tracing his extracts on tablets coated with wax, using a hard stile <lb/>
            or pen, than with his writing on parchment with pen and ink, which is per­ <lb/>
            fectly natural. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Some authors have supposed that this Count Theodoric is the same <lb/>
            person as the Theodoricus comes described by Eginhard as a relation of <lb/>
            Charlemagne. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 St. William was not created duke of Aquitain by Charlemagne in <lb/>

            duke, probably of Septimania. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 We find no such name as this among the Saracen kings and emirs <lb/>

            the Christian empire, and subduing the Saracens.1 William <lb/>
            built a monastery in honour of St. Saviour and the twelve <lb/>
            apostles in the territory of Lodève in a valley called Gellone <lb/>
            surrounded by rocks,2 placing in it an abbot and a company <lb/>
            of devout monks, and largely endowing it with all things <lb/>
            necessary for them, and he had their grants confirmed by <lb/>
            his own and royal charters. His two sisters Albana and <lb/>
            Bertha became nuns there and continued perseveringly in <lb/>
            the service of God.</p>
          <p>A long time afterwards, William coming to France on the <lb/>
            summons of Charles3 was honourably received and disclosed <lb/>
            to him his desire of becoming a monk. The king could not <lb/>
            refrain from tears in granting his permission, and bid him <lb/>
            take whatever he would from his treasury to carry to his <lb/>
            church. However William rejected all worldly riches, but <lb/>
            asked for and obtained a reliquary containing a portion of <lb/>
            the wood of the holy cross. It had been sent to Charles by <lb/>
            Zachariah, patriarch of Jerusalem, a prelate of great worth, <lb/>
            while the king was at Rome in the first year of his reign. <lb/>
            When William's intention to change his state of life became <lb/>
            known, the king's court was agitated and all the city in an <lb/>
            uproar. A crowd of nobles forced their way into his presence, <lb/>
            and sorrowfully entreated him not to desert them. He <lb/>
            however, inflamed with divine ardour, abandoned all, and, <lb/>

            He drew near to it with naked feet and with hair-cloth <lb/>

            they met him at the cross roads, and forming a festive pro­ <lb/>
            cession against his will, conducted him to the abbey. He <lb/>
            then made his offering of the reliquary more precious than <lb/>

            suddenly changed and made another person in Christ <lb/>
            Jesus. For after his profession he was taught without <lb/>
            being offended, and corrected without being angry. He <lb/>
            suffered blows and injuries unresistingly and without <lb/>
            having recourse to threats. He rejoiced to be subject, and <lb/>
            delighted in every kind of humiliation, being ready to serve, <lb/>
            obey, and submit to all. He made daily progress in all <lb/>
            sanctity and religion and the observance of the sacred rule, <lb/>
            like gold made bright in the furnace. He completed, <lb/>
            according to his design, the monastery which was in an <lb/>
            unfinished state when he became a monk, receiving the aid <lb/>
            of his sons Bernard and William (to whom he had resigned <lb/>
            his counties2), and of other counts in the neighbourhood. <lb/>
            He made a road to the monastery by a sharp and difficult <lb/>

            represents the pious monk as disposing of his dignities just as if he had <lb/>
            lived several generations later." The titles of duke, count, &amp;c., certainly <lb/>
            were not heieditary in the time of Charlemagne, nor till long afterwards. <lb/>
            They were merely personal, and conferred official rank and power as <lb/>
            governors of provinces, &amp;c., at the will of the emperor or king. Still St. <lb/>
            William, as a favourite general of Charlemagne, may have obtained per­ <lb/>
            mission to resign his governments in favour of his sons. In point of fact, <lb/>

            and the counties of Toulouse and Barcelona, but not till the year 817 as <lb/>

            fragments laid the base of a causeway along the river <lb/>
            Hcrault and abutting on the heights.1</p>
          <p>Lewis, king of Aquitain, the son of Charlemagne, at the <lb/>
            request of William, gave to the monastery, with great <lb/>
            willingness, several fiefs in his territories, and confirmed the <lb/>
            grant by a royal charter sealed with his ring.2 Meanwhile, <lb/>
            William caused vineyards and oliveyards, and several gardens <lb/>
            to be laid out on the ground surrounding the monastery, and <lb/>
            clearing the valley of the woods which naturally grew there, <lb/>
            planted fruit-trees in their place. He devoted himself with <lb/>
            intense industry to these and similar works, labouring with <lb/>
            his own hands, for the love of God, in rural occupations, and <lb/>
            continually thus employed himself with true humility and <lb/>
            religion. He often prostrated himself before the abbot and <lb/>
            brethren, beseeching that for God's mercy, he might be <lb/>
            allowed still greater self-renunciation and humiliation. He <lb/>
            sought the lowest offices in the monastery; it was his <lb/>
            desire to be considered the vilest of all, and to be held in <lb/>
            contempt. He would be a beast of burthen, and as an ass's <lb/>
            colt bear the burthens of the brethren in the house of the <lb/>
            Lord. He who had been a mighty duke was not ashamed <lb/>
            to mount a miserable ass with a load of bottles. See the <lb/>

            his own hand he washes the bowls and platters, gathers <lb/>
            vegetables, makes the soup and mixes the pulse with it. <lb/>
            When the hour of refection is come, without delay he <lb/>
            spreads the table for the monks in due order, while he <lb/>

          <p>Once, when wood for baking was scarce, he was forced to <lb/>

            the sign of the cross, entered the oven and did all that was <lb/>
            needful without sustaining any injury. Throwing out the <lb/>
            hot cinders with his naked hands, he collected the ashes in <lb/>
            his cowl without its being singed, put the oven in order <lb/>
            and sprinkled it for putting in the loaves. Though William <lb/>
            thus stood in the fire for some time, neither his body nor his <lb/>
            clothes were scorched. After this, however, the abbot, by <lb/>
            the advice of the brethren, forbad his engaging in any servile <lb/>
            works, and, allotting him a suitable cell, enjoined him to <lb/>
            apply his leisure to prayer and holy meditation. Thus <lb/>
            having had a long experience of active exercises, he began <lb/>
            to take rest in a life of reflection, and, having performed <lb/>
            the service and busy occupations of Martha, joined with <lb/>
            Mary in the delights of heavenly contemplation.</p>
          <p>When, at length, William was full of perfection in virtue, <lb/>
            he was endowed with the spirit of prophecy, and his course <lb/>
            of life was shown him by divine revelation. He predicted <lb/>
            the day of his death to the abbot and brethren, and even <lb/>
            announced it in writing to many of the neighbours. He also <lb/>
            sent a messenger to Charlemagne to inform him distinctly by <lb/>

          <p>IT was thus that Gerald of Avranches frequently re­ <lb/>
            counted the triumphs of the invincible soldiers of Christ, <lb/>
            and stirred up the knights with whom he associated, and <lb/>
            their well-born squires, both by persuasions and alarms, to a <lb/>
            similar course of life. The result was, that in the first <lb/>
            instance five men of eminence quitted the earl's household, <lb/>
            whose names are these; Roger, son of Erneis, nephew of <lb/>
            William Warrene, earl of Surry, Arnulf, son of Humphrey <lb/>
            de Tilleul, nephew of Hugh de Grantmesnil, viscount of <lb/>
            Leicester, and Guy of Mantes his squire; Dreux, son of <lb/>
            Geoffrey de Neuf-Marché ; and Odo, son of Arnulf of <lb/>
            Dôl, and chaplain to the earl. At the suggestion of Ar­ <lb/>
            nulf, whose kinsmen had assisted in building the abbey <lb/>
            of St. Evroult, all these went to Ouche and were gladly <lb/>
            received into the monastery by abbot Mainier. They lived <lb/>
            there regularly for a long time, and contributed to the <lb/>
            prosperity of the community by their exertions and care.</p>
          <p>Thus Gerald had by preaching the word of God stirred <lb/>
            up to better things those who were sunk in fatal oblivious­ <lb/>
            ness in the gulf of the world's temptations, as the cock <lb/>
            rouses those who are sleeping in the dead of the night. He <lb/>
            now shook his wings, and casting off his sluggishness, with <lb/>
            a lively effort prepared to follow his disciples, who have just <lb/>

            Winchester, he was taken very ill, and, in fear of death, <lb/>
            devoutly assumed the monastic habit in the old monastery <lb/>
            of St. Peter, where he long lived a regular life under the <lb/>
            abbot Walkeline, and Godfrey the religious and learned <lb/>

            to ecclesiastical rule, and was appointed the first abbot of <lb/>
            Tewksbury, when Samson of Bayeux2 was bishop of <lb/>
            Worcester. Robert Fitz-Hamon 3 had founded this abbey <lb/>
            of Tewksbury, on the river Severn, in the reign of William <lb/>

            viscount of Kent, and one of the judges in the cause between Lanfranc <lb/>
            and Odo, bishop of Bayeux. He had two sons, the eldest of whom was <lb/>

            even exceeded the juniors in the labours to be undergone; <lb/>

            For, after Robert Fitz-Hamon's death, Robert of Brittany <lb/>
            brought some false charges before King Henry against his <lb/>
            abbot, by whom he had been admitted into the monastery. <lb/>
            The abbot being summoned before the king declined to <lb/>
            enter into long explanations, but, satisfied with the con­ <lb/>
            sciousness of his innocence, voluntarily resigned to the king <lb/>
            the government of his abbey, and after submitting to <lb/>
            Martha's toilsome services, chose with Mary the better part, <lb/>
            by returning again to his retirement in the monastery at <lb/>
            Winchester. To finish his history, he sometime afterwards <lb/>
            received an invitation from the venerable Ralph, bishop of <lb/>
            Rochester,1 and at the request of many persons, went to the <lb/>
            bishop for the purpose of conferring with him on sacred <lb/>
            subjects; but while there, at the summons of God, he took <lb/>
            to his bed, and having duly performed all that was fitting <lb/>
            for a servant of God died in sanctity.2</p>

            already seen, by the exhortations of Gerald, escaping as it <lb/>
            were from the destruction of Sodom, went to St. Evroult <lb/>
            with four of his companions to become a monk, and lived <lb/>
            there nearly forty-six years, filled with zeal for the duties <lb/>
            of his order, and abounding in all virtues. Though his <lb/>
            person was handsome, he chose to disfigure it by a mean <lb/>

            himself but generous to others, always alive for vigils, and <lb/>
            incredibly modest. He did not plume himself with carnal <lb/>
            ostentation on account of his noble birth, but obeyed the <lb/>
            rule with unhesitating humility, and chose with pleasure to <lb/>
            perform the lowest offices required of the monks. For <lb/>
            many years he was in the habit of cleaning the brethren's <lb/>
            shoes, washing their stockings, and cheerfully doing other <lb/>
            services which appear mean to stupid and conceited persons. <lb/>
            He ornamented a book of the gospels with gold, silver, and <lb/>
            precious stones, and procured several vestments and copes <lb/>
            for the chanters, with carpets, and curtains, and other <lb/>
            ornaments, for the church. He got all he could from his <lb/>
            brothers and relations, as occasion offered, and what he <lb/>
            wrested from their bodily gratifications he applied with joy <lb/>
            to divine offices for the good of their souls.</p>
          <p>Richard de Coulonces, the brother of this Roger, came to <lb/>
            St. Evroult and gave to the abbey the church of Etouvi, <lb/>
            which he had redeemed from one Ernest, his tenant, adding <lb/>
            the tithe of two mills. The grant of these possessions, in <lb/>
            which Adelaide, his wife, and tho aforesaid Ernest, joined, <lb/>
            he placed on the altar. In return for this grant, the monks <lb/>
            gave to Richard eight livres, and to Robert de Mowbray,1 <lb/>
            who was the paramount lord, a hundred shillings, where­ <lb/>
            upon he forthwith, in the orchard of Turstin de Soulangi,2 <lb/>
            confirmed the grant of the church of Etouvi as the monks <lb/>
            required. This Richard de Coulonces became very rich, <lb/>
            and being a favourite with King Henry rose to eminence <lb/>
            among his peers. His prosperity continued to an advanced <lb/>
            age, and he had by his wife eleven sons and four daughters, <lb/>
            whose names are here given: Hugh, Geoffrey, Richard. <lb/>
            John, Robert, Odo, Henry, Ivo, Rodolph, William, and <lb/>
            Henry; Rohais, Adeliza, Matilda, and Avicia. Of these, <lb/>
            two were dedicated to God from their infancy; for John <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert de Mowbray, earl of Northumberland, nephew of Geoffrey, <lb/>

            was admitted a monk at St. Evroult, and Adeliza became a <lb/>
            nun in the convent of the Holy Trinity at Caen.</p>
          <p>Richard de Coulonces died on the seventeenth of the <lb/>
            calends of October [September 15], in the year of our Lord <lb/>
            1125; and the year following his son Hugh came to St. <lb/>
            Evroult, and making an offering to God upon the altar, of a <lb/>
            golden salver, truly confirmed the grant of all that his father <lb/>
            had given as before-mentioned, placing also the charter on <lb/>
            the altar. He also devoted himself to St. Evroult.</p>

            he had often received invitations, and paid friendly visits to <lb/>
            Lanfranc the archbishop, and others, to whom be was greatly <lb/>
            attached. He was treated with great respect by the king <lb/>
            and his nobles, and took the opportunity of addressing pru­ <lb/>

            left Normandy to better their fortunes, and obtained <lb/>
            promotion in England. These distinguished monks were <lb/>
            also received with favour by the great lords of the realm, <lb/>
            whose kindness to the strangers was shown by the gifts <lb/>
            heaped upon them out of the wealth acquired with violence <lb/>
            in a foreign land. The king and his nobles joyfully made <lb/>
            them gifts of farms, sums of money, and ornaments for their <lb/>
            church, commending themselves to their prayers with conn­ <lb/>

            Then Queen Matilda, hearing a good report of the life of the <lb/>
            monks, came to St. Evroult to pay her devotions, and being <lb/>
            received by the brethren with due honours offered a mark of <lb/>
            gold on the altar, and commended herself with her daughter <lb/>
            Constance to the prayers of the brethren.6 She also ordered <note type="footnote"> 1 Rhuddlan in Flintshire. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This noble family, which has extended its branches both in Normandy <lb/>

            p. JOB. She may have been betrothed about that time (1076), but the <lb/>
            marriage did not take place till 1086. </note> <lb/>

            that a refectory of stone, for their common use, should be <lb/>
            built at her expense. She further gave to St. Evroult a <lb/>
            chasuble enriched with gold and jewels, and an elegant cope <lb/>
            for the chanter, with a promise to make further offerings if <lb/>
            she lived; but she was prevented by death from fulfilling it. <lb/>
            Likewise Adeline, wife of Roger de Beaumont,' gave to the <lb/>
            monks of St. Evroult an alb fringed with gold, which the <lb/>
            priest was used to wear when celebrating mass on solemn <lb/>
            occasions. In like manner many persons of both sexes made <lb/>
            offerings of various kinds to the abbey, desiring to participate <lb/>
            in the spiritual benefits which were there conferred by the <lb/>
            Maker of the universe.</p>
          <p>At this time three brothers served God with merit in the <lb/>
            monastic habit at St. Evroult; Roger, surnamed Nicholas, <lb/>
            Roger and Odo. They were the sons of a priest named <lb/>
            Gervase de Montreuil, who had been long ago transferred by <lb/>
            abbot Theodoric from being curate of the parish of Les <lb/>
            Essarts to that of Sap. The three brothers made their <lb/>
            profession while they were youths, and becoming remarkable <lb/>
            among the brethren for their worth, were highly esteemed <lb/>
            both by God and man. The eldest was an unlearned man, <lb/>
            but a devoted lover of virtue, and he skilfully superintended <lb/>
            the work of building the new church. The two others were <lb/>
            eminent scholars and priests, firm supporters of their superior, <lb/>
            and his able vicars, both within and without the convent. <lb/>
            The abbot made Odo prior of his monastery, for though he <lb/>
            was the youngest brother he was the best speaker and most <lb/>
            fitted for active affairs. Roger the eldest brother who had <lb/>
            made the greatest advances in learning, was sent to England <lb/>
            on affairs of the church. In this he promptly obeyed his <lb/>
            superior's command; he also made by his own efforts a shrine <lb/>
            to hold relics of the saints, which he elegantly ornamented <lb/>
            with silver and gold.2 His skill procured many treasures for <lb/>
            the church, such as a variety of furniture, and copes and <lb/>

            all for his kind disposition. Having filled the various offices <lb/>
            which the monastic system requires for twenty years, he was <lb/>

          <p>THE young Ralph, son of Albert de Cravent, at the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of his military career, fell in with Guitmond the <lb/>
            monk3 in the valley of Guyon, coming from Maule, attended <lb/>
            by a servant; and unhorsing the monk, carried off the <lb/>
            palfreys. The monk made his way to Pad on foot, and in <lb/>
            great tribulation implored Albert's protection against his <lb/>
            son.4 The knight however replied superciliously, and at once <lb/>
            refused to render him any assistance in the recovery of his <lb/>
            horses. Upon finding this, Alberede his wife began making <lb/>
            lamentations, tossing her hands, and tearing her hair, and <lb/>
            mourning for her son as if he were just dead. She cried out <lb/>
            like a distracted person, exclaiming with mingled groans and <lb/>
            tears: " My son Ralph, you have begun your career in folly <lb/>
            rather than in arms. Alas! you have listened to detestable <lb/>
            teachers, and, foolish boy! have been led astray by their fatal <lb/>

            of perdition. What a sad message have you sent me! what <lb/>
            bitter grief have you occasioned me ! misguided young man ! <lb/>
            what shall I say to you ? You have incurred fatal degrada­ <lb/>
            tion by unjustly treating an unarmed servant of Christ. O <lb/>
            my son Ralph! what were you doing in your folly when your <lb/>
            first passage in arms was against the Almighty? I am <lb/>
            persuaded full well, that I shall have small cause for joy and <lb/>
            abundant sorrow for your exploit. Do not all the doctors <lb/>
            of the church agree in asserting unanimously, that the Most <lb/>
            High dwells in his saints and shares with them good and <lb/>
            evil ? And you, his father, come to the aid of your infatuated <lb/>
            son, and use all diligence to have the stolen horses restored <lb/>
            to the disconsolate monk, lest your only son should, for such a <lb/>
            crime, be forthwith given over to the devil." The prudent <lb/>
            mother thus supplicating for her son's welfare, and seriously <lb/>
            endeavouring to console the distressed monk, Albert and all <lb/>
            his household were moved and frightened, and his mule being <lb/>
            returned he sent his men-at-arms with him as far as Bréval, <lb/>
            and having severely reprimanded his son insisted on his <lb/>
            instantly giving up every thing he had taken from him. <lb/>
            Guitmond therefore, recovering his horses, departed for Pact, <lb/>
            having returned thanks to Albert and his wife, both of whom <lb/>
            solicited and obtained his pardon for the offence which had <lb/>
            been committed. Alberede was daughter of Hugh bishop of <lb/>
            Evreux,' and was highly esteemed by the neighbours for her <lb/>
            great worth, as far as things were in her power.</p>
          <p>The same year the young man just spoken of fell sick, and <lb/>
            repenting of his crime sought for pardon from the monks of <lb/>
            St. Evroult, and devoted himself and all he posessed to the <lb/>
            saint. At his death his sorrowing father caused his corpse <lb/>
            to be conveyed to the abbey, and gave one moiety of the <lb/>
            tithes of Lommoie to St. Evroult, free as he himself possessed <lb/>
            it. The other moiety was held of him by the monks of <lb/>
            Coulombs,2 under the agreement that they should pay and <lb/>
            perform on his behalf all episcopal dues and all services which <lb/>
            were reserved. This grant was made to St. Evroult in the <lb/>
            year of our lord 1070, when Philip was king of France and <lb/>
            Geoffrey (nephew of Reginald, bishop of Paris) was bishop <note type="footnote"> 1 Hugh, bishop of Lisieux, who died at the council of Rheims, held in <lb/>

            of his wife Beatrice, determined to establish monks on his <lb/>
            patrimonial domains at Aufay, by whose intercessions and <lb/>
            merits he might be aided in the day of account. His nephew <lb/>
            Dreux had lately retired from his worldly service, and become <lb/>
            a monk in the monastary of St. Evroult the confessor, for <lb/>
            which reason Gilbert had become much attached to abbot <lb/>
            Mainier and the monks, and gave them the church of St. <lb/>
            Mary d'Aufay, with all his prebends; in such wise that six <lb/>
            monks should be appointed instead of the six canons who <lb/>
            then served the church, and should succeed to their prebends <lb/>
            when the canons died or gave up their secular calling for a <lb/>
            stricter rule of life. The aforesaid lord gave also to the <lb/>
            same monks all the rill of Pare,' with the church and entire <lb/>
            tithes of the same vill, as free and discharged from all <lb/>
            burdensome services, as he held it himself. He released the <lb/>
            men of Pare from all compulsory. service, except they were <lb/>
            summoned by the duke of Normandy in a general levy. He <lb/>
            gave for yearly tithes from his mill at Aufay two bushels of <lb/>
            wheat, and half a bushel of any sort of grain from another <lb/>
            mill on the Sie. He also granted liberty for the monks to <lb/>
            receive daily two ass-loads of fire-wood from his forest of <lb/>
            Hérichards. The aforesaid knight had the fee of two waggon <lb/>
            loads of wine yearly from the duke of Normandy, out of <lb/>
            which he granted for ever to the monks one muid for use <lb/>
            in celebrating the mass. He further gave two churches, <lb/>
            with all the tithes and land belonging to them, one at Pare <lb/>
            which was built in honour of St. Mary, mother of God, and <lb/>
            the other at Beaunai, dedicated to St. Peter, prince of the <lb/>
            apostles. These being prebends of the church of Aufay were <lb/>
            then held by two of the canons. Ralph served the church <lb/>
            of Fare, but some time afterwards he was overtaken by a tem­ <lb/>
            pest as he was returning from England, and the ship being <lb/>
            wrecked, perished in the sea with all on board. Walter <lb/>
            had the church of Beaunai, but he soon afterwards became <lb/>
            a monk of St. Evroult.</p>
          <p>All these Gilbert, with his wife Beatrice, freely gave to <lb/>
            the church of God for the good of his soul, and he often <lb/>
            used his best efforts to persuade his tenants and friends to <lb/>
            augment his endowment. Geoffrey therefore, one of his <lb/>
            knights, gave to St. Mary the church of St. Denys2 with all <note type="footnote"> 1 Notre-Dame-du-Parc. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 St. Denys-sur-Sie. </note> <pb n="264"/>

            made by his father and mother by his own act. He also <lb/>
            added the tenth of the tolls of Aufay, and six burgesses, <lb/>
            with all their services, entirely releasing them from all obli­ <lb/>
            gation to himself, except in respect of the general service <lb/>

          <p>Moreover, his wife Avicia, in her zealous love of God, <lb/>
            gave to the monks sixty pence out of her rents payable on <lb/>
            the calends [1st] of October to buy, yearly, oil and wax for <lb/>
            lights in the church, together with incense; and she offered <lb/>
            the deed of gift with her husband on the altar of St. Mary. <lb/>

            Cropus,1 and Robert, son of Godmond, John-Catus, and <lb/>

            Avicia his wife, making progress in devotion to God, de­ <lb/>
            manded from Roger, abbot of St. Evroult, twelve monks, and <lb/>
            assigned for their necessary sustenance the mill of Pare, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IT is now my intention to give some account of the origin <lb/>
            of the lords of Aufay, and their acts. Gilbert, surnamed <lb/>
            the Advocate of St. Valeri,1 married a daughter of Duke <lb/>
            Richard, by whom he had Bernard, father of Walter de <lb/>
            St. Valery and Richard Heugleville. Richard was long <lb/>
            employed in the military service of his uncle, Richard, duke <lb/>
            of Normandy, from whom he received in marriage the <lb/>
            noble Ada, widow of the elder Herluin of Heugleville, with <lb/>
            all her inheritance. The duke also made him many presents, <lb/>
            and promised him more ; which promises he would have libe­ <lb/>
            rably performed if Richard had taken pains to please him. <lb/>
            He built a town at the place formerly called Isnelville, on <lb/>
            the river Sie, and called it from the hill above it overspread <lb/>
            with beech-trees, Aufay [Alfagium], introducing among his <lb/>
            colonists the customs of Corneilles. This Richard was <lb/>
            distinguished for his military conduct and great liberality, <lb/>
            whereby he was formidable to his enemies, and faithful to <lb/>
            his friends. <note type="footnote"> 1 Advocatus. It is meant that the lords of St. Valery (sur Somme) <lb/>
            did not hold the fief in their own right. They were tributaries to the <lb/>
            abbey founded there by Clothaire in 613, to which the lordship belonged. <lb/>
            It was not likely, that as this was the port from which the Norman fleet <lb/>
            sailed for the conquest of England, its lords would be forgotten in the <lb/>
            division of the spoil. We find, accordingly, Walter de St. Valery <lb/>
            possessed, among other domains, of the extensive manor of Isleworth, <lb/>
            Middlesex, which continued to be part of the English barony of St. Valery. <lb/>
            It was still held by Robert, count de Dreux, in 1220, in right of his wife <lb/>
            Annora, daughter and heiress of Thomas, lord of St. Valery-sur-Somme. </note> <pb n="267"/>

          <p>During the non-age of William, Duke Robert's son, when <lb/>
            William d'Arques revolted against the duke,1 and almost all <lb/>
            the lords of Talou likewise deserted the cause of the bastard <lb/>
            prince, Richard alone held his castle near the church of <lb/>
            St. Aubin against the rebels, and endeavoured to defend the <lb/>
            country round in its allegiance to the duke against the <lb/>
            irruptions of the garrison of Arques. He was seconded in <lb/>
            this enterprise by his sons-in-law Geoffrey and Hugh de <lb/>
            Morimont, both sons of Turketil de Neuf-Marché but <lb/>
            Hugh having been suddenly surrounded, with his followers, <lb/>
            by the people of Arques near Morimont, they were cut to <lb/>
            pieces, defending themselves bravely. As for Geoffrey, he <lb/>
            had two sons by Ada, daughter of Richard, Bernard and <lb/>
            Dreux, whose lots were very different. Dreux relinquished <lb/>
            military service and devoted himself to a religious life at <lb/>
            St. Evroult; becoming a monk, he learnt letters, and rose <lb/>
            through the different gradations of holy orders to the priest­ <lb/>
            hood. On the contrary, Bernard continued in the career <lb/>
            of arms till an advanced age, and served in the wars under <lb/>
            three kings of England with great bravery.3 In the time of <lb/>
            William Rufus, he fought a battle with Rhys, king of Wales, <lb/>
            and having slain him, built the castle of Brecknock, and <lb/>
            possessed the kingdom of the Welsh, of which Talgarth was <lb/>
            the capital for many years.' He also built a church in <lb/>
            honour of St. John the Evangelist in his town of Brecknock, <note type="footnote"> 1 This rebellion broke out in 1053. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As to Geoffrey de Neuf-Marché, see book In. c. 10, and book v. c. 12. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 For Bernard de Neuf-Marché, lord of Brecknock, and his wife- Nesta <lb/>

            and Newbury was not yet built on the territory of Speen. Bernard's <lb/>

          <p>Gilbert, Richard's son, married Beatrice, daughter of <lb/>
            Christian de Valenciennes,2 an illustrious captain, who bore <lb/>
            to her husband Walter, Hugh and Beatrice. This lord, the <lb/>
            duke's kinsman, fought by his side at the head of his vassals <lb/>
            in all the principal actions during the English war. But <lb/>
            when William became king and peace was restored, Gilbert <lb/>
            returned to Normandy, notwithstanding William offered <lb/>
            him ample domains in England ; for with innate honesty of <lb/>
            character, he refused to participate in the fruits of rapine. <lb/>
            Content with his patrimonial estates, he declined those of <lb/>
            others, and piously devoted his son Hugh to a monastic <lb/>
            life under abbot Mainier in the monastery of St. Evroult. <lb/>
            He lived long with his religious wife, who was a cousin of <lb/>
            Queen Matilda, and continued to the end in the practice of <lb/>
            almsgiving, prayers, and other good works. The venerable <lb/>
            Beatrice survived her husband three years, and. died in a <lb/>
            holy confession on the second of the nones [4th of January].</p>
          <p>Walter was a young man of elegance but little wisdom ; <lb/>
            in consequence of which he paid a ready submission to <lb/>
            Edmund and other false teachers. Frequenting the society of <lb/>
            spendthrifts, he wasted his inheritance by their pernicious <lb/>
            advice, and troubled the monks and clergy and tenants with <lb/>
            frequent and unjust attacks. Having been knighted, he <lb/>
            married Avicia, the accomplished and beautiful daughter of <lb/>
            Herbrand,3 by whose counsels and wise influence he was in <lb/>
            a measure withdrawn from his evil ways. She was prudent, <lb/>
            fluent in speech, and devoted to God from her youth, exer­ <lb/>
            cising herself in good works to the utmost of her power. <lb/>
            She had three brothers, Jordan, William, and Robert, <lb/>
            distinguished knights, by whose assistance their brother-in- <lb/>
            law prevailed against his crafty advisers, and recovered much <lb/>
            which he had dissipated and lost by fraud and robbery. <lb/>
            Avicia bore her husband twelve sons and daughters, most of <lb/>
            whom died prematurely in their infancy. She herself, after <note type="footnote"> 1 Bernard made the priory of Brecon a dependency -on Battle Abbey. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This lady probably came into Normandy with the Duchess Matilda, <lb/>

            living fifteen years with her husband, died on the eighth of <lb/>
            the calends of March [22nd February], and was buried in <lb/>
            the cloisters of the monks she so much loved, near the <lb/>
            church door. Prior Warm caused an arch of stone to be <lb/>
            built over her grave, and Vitalis the Englishman composed <lb/>
            her epitaph, as follows:- <lb/>
            HAVISE, a noble lady, lies below, <lb/>
            May Christ on her eternal rest bestow! <lb/>
            Her life to excellence in virtue's ways <lb/>
            She framed with earnest zeal-her highest praise. <lb/>
            Still she was fair, and to her beaming face, <lb/>
            Wisdom gave eloquence, and talent grace. <lb/>
            To God her earliest years she willing lent, <lb/>
            Her steps to mass and vespers daily bent; <lb/>
            Then WALTER D'AUFAY'S honoured wife became, <lb/>
            Bore him twelve scions of his ancient name, <lb/>
            And fifteen years maintained her spotless fame; <lb/>
            For sacred rites this priory she endowed, <lb/>
            With her own ornaments the altars glowed ; <lb/>
            Nor cost nor care for priests and monks she spared, <lb/>
            And widows, sick, and poor, her bounty shared. <lb/>
            When February's latter days gave promise fair, <lb/>
            And holy church kept feast of " Peter's chair,”1 <lb/>
            High festival, o'ershadowed then with gloom, <lb/>
            Saw pious Havise summoned to the tomb. <lb/>
            Ye men of Aufay, mourn your lady lost; <lb/>
            Christ, number her among the heavenly host! Amen.</p>
          <p>Walter survived his wife's funeral nearly three years, and <lb/>
            suffering under a lingering disease, assumed the habit of a <lb/>
            monk, and soon afterwards, having made his confession and <lb/>
            received absolution, he died on the sixth of the calends of <lb/>
            June [26th May]. Prior Hildegord buried him at the feet <lb/>
            of his wife, and Vitalis made the following verses upon <lb/>
            him :— <lb/>
            SIR WALTER, LORD OF AUFAY, here finds rest; <lb/>
            Peace be his endless portion with the blest! <lb/>
            A cloistered monk, he went from hence to heaven, <lb/>
            When May's bright suns had numbered twenty-seven. <lb/>
            His sins confessed, his lingering tortures ceased, <lb/>

          <p>Walter left at his death four orphan children; Richard, <lb/>
            Jordan, Walter, and Elias; who fell to the guardianship of <lb/>
            King Henry, and he entrusted the government of the <lb/>
            lordship of Aufay to Robert the viscount, for two years. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, Jordan de Sackville obtained the whole fief by <lb/>
            his services and presents to the king, and had the custody <lb/>
            of his nephews to bring them up out of their own patri­ <lb/>
            mony, which for four years he managed well and improved. <lb/>
            Richard, however, died when he was only twelve years old, <lb/>
            and was buried in the church of St. Mary, mother of God. <lb/>
            Jordan then succeeded his brother; he was a handsome <lb/>
            youth, and his conduct was excellent. Having learnt his <lb/>
            military exercises in the court of Henry, that king gave him <lb/>
            a prudent and handsome wife, Juliana, the daughter of <lb/>
            Godescalch, who had followed Queen Adelaide to England <lb/>
            from the country of Louvaine.1</p>
          <p>Thus far I have frequently spoken of the affairs of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, which fill the greatest part of my book. I entreat <lb/>
            my reader not to be displeased, if, mindful of benefits con­ <lb/>
            ferred, I make mention of our benefactors. It is indeed my <lb/>
            desire to fix firmly in the memory of postery the history of­ <lb/>
            our founders and their benevolent fellow labourers, that the <lb/>
            children of the church may be mindful before God, in the <lb/>
            presence of angels, of those by whose endowments subsis­ <lb/>
            tence is provided for them while they perform the services <lb/>
            of the Creator of all things. Thus when Abram returned <lb/>
            victorious from the slaughter of the four kings, and recovered <lb/>
            his nephew Lot, with his fellow captives of both sexes and <lb/>
            all his substance, he commanded his confederates to take <lb/>
            their share of the spoils of Sodom. By Abram, which <lb/>
            signifies the supreme father, are to be understood those <lb/>
            men of perfection who contend daily with evil spirits and <lb/>
            the sins of the flesh, overcoming the world and the prince <lb/>
            of this world, and treading under foot and esteeming as <lb/>
            dung worldly vanities and the temptations of the flesh. By <lb/>

            by the active valour of his spiritual uncle (Lot signifying <lb/>
            one bound or led aside), is meant the carnal mind or brutal <lb/>
            people, enchained in Sodom, that is in sinful delights, and <lb/>
            which fast bound in the embraces of sin, is led astray from <lb/>
            God and made captive by evil spirits. By the confederates <lb/>
            of Abram who, as we read, fought in his company, are <lb/>
            justly signified those faithful laymen who at his command <lb/>
            are said to have received a share of the spoils. For thus it <lb/>
            is written in the book of Genesis: " And the king of Sodom <lb/>
            said unto Abram, Give me the persons and take the goods <lb/>
            to thyself. And Abram replied to him, I will not receive <lb/>
            anything that is thine, save only that which the young <lb/>
            men have eaten and the portion of the men which came <lb/>
            with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre : let them take their <lb/>
            portion.”1 Many of the laity are distinguished by their <lb/>
            courteous and decorous manners, are united in faith and <lb/>
            good-will to the regular soldiers of. Christ, and kindly cheer <lb/>
            them in their manful conflicts with the demons. But they <lb/>
            do not give up the fleeting world, nor entirely relinquish its <lb/>
            advantages, they are bound to it by a legal servitude, and <lb/>
            they offend God by repeated transgressions of his law; but <lb/>
            they expiate their sins by alms, as Daniel counsels. They <lb/>
            found monasteries for the service of God, from the portions <lb/>
            they receive of the spoils of the enemy, and from the <lb/>
            mammon of iniquity they piously erect hospitals for the sick <lb/>
            and poor, and provide food and clothing for the votaries <lb/>
            of heaven out of their substance. Moreover, the king <lb/>
            of Sodom, when congratulating Abram on his victory, <lb/>
            represents the devil who daily tempts the saints with a <lb/>
            thousand artifices, assailing them night and day with <lb/>
            blandishments and terrors, and craftily employing all the <lb/>
            delights of the world, its wealth and its honours, to the sole <lb/>
            purpose of drawing souls into his own pit of perdition. <lb/>
            We find, however, that Abram despised the king's smooth <lb/>
            flatteries, and disdained to accept either his praises or his <lb/>
            gifts, only suffering his companions in arms to receive their <lb/>
            portions, and what was necessary for their subsistence. So <lb/>
            it is that holy men while they spend the time of their war­ <lb/>
            fare in this present life despise all worldly things in their <note type="footnote"> I Genesis xiv. 21—24. Our author, as usual, is not very exact in his <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. CH. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            desire after heavenly, and desire no reward for their sanctity. <lb/>
            Still they warn the great men of the world, who are their <lb/>
            fellow heirs of the catholic faith and the hope of everlasting <lb/>
            bliss, that they ought to endow the monasteries with some <lb/>
            portion of their domains and fortunes, and thus support by <lb/>
            their gifts the poor and the despisers of the world, that they <lb/>
            may claim eternal glory from Christ who saith, that he <lb/>
            dwells with the poor. It may be proved by many authorities <lb/>
            and examples that men are the gainers towards their <lb/>
            eternal salvation to the full extent of all they mercifully <lb/>
            distribute in alms, according to our Saviour's precept; <lb/>
            for what they lavishly spend in carnal delights, or throw <lb/>
            away to no purpose on the empty splendour of worldly <lb/>
            felicity, passes away like flowing water never to return. <lb/>
            Those also who amass great wealth to leave it to their heirs <lb/>
            often, alas! lay up for themselves an increase of perversity <lb/>
            and wretchedness, and only take pains to bring up their chil­ <lb/>
            dren to many misfortunes, while they themselves, abandoned <lb/>
            to robbery, rapine, and all kinds of wickedness, deservedly <lb/>
            perish, undergoing the vengeance merited by their crimes. <lb/>
            Thus it happens that they are neither fit for heaven or <lb/>
            earth, and while their ungrateful heirs succeed to their <lb/>
            ample possessions, those who have gathered enormous riches <lb/>
            for unworthy successors are subject to the maledictions of <lb/>
            many.</p>
          <p>Wise and provident men make themselves friends of <lb/>
            the mammon of unrighteousness, who, while they receive <lb/>
            their carnal things for the sustenance of life, repay their <lb/>
            benefactors by their merits and prayers with spiritual and <lb/>
            eternal benefits. Evroult of Bayeux took great pains to <lb/>
            obtain such debtors. I have already related many things <lb/>
            concerning him in the present work; I shall now enter into <lb/>
            further particulars of this father, shortly abridging his acts <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CH. IX. The life of St. Evroult, the founder of the abbey of that name in the forest of Ouche, in the sixth century.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE venerable father Evroult was descended from a noble <lb/>
            family, and born at Bayeux.1 His parents educated him <lb/>
            with great care, and entrusted him to teachers of the <lb/>
            catholic faith. Such was the facility with which he pursued <lb/>
            his studies both in divinity and human learning that he is <lb/>
            said to have excelled his masters while he was yet a boy. <lb/>
            For divine grace, which foresaw that he would become a <lb/>
            doctor of religion, efficaciously rendered him docile in all <lb/>
            things. Nor did he, by the pride or self-conceit natural to <lb/>
            his age, spoil the dignity of his exalted character. His person <lb/>
            was graceful and his discourse agreeable, and no fickleness of <lb/>
            temper ever led him to be severe to any one. Illustrious, <lb/>
            as we have just remarked, by birth, and already marked <lb/>
            out by the prescience of Almighty God, he presently became <lb/>
            known to King Clothaire, son of Clovis, who was the first of <lb/>
            the Frank kings who became Christian, and was baptized <lb/>
            by St. Remigius, bishop of Rheims, with three thousand of <lb/>
            his nobles. Clothaire, discovering who Evroult was and his <lb/>
            high nobility, ordered that he should be forthwith presented <lb/>
            to him, judging that one so gifted with brilliant talents <lb/>
            should serve in the offices of the state. Notwithstanding <lb/>
            his humility, the Supreme Ruler gave him such favour with <lb/>
            the earthly sovereign that he was preferred before others, and <lb/>
            obtained the highest appointment in the palace. Endowed <lb/>
            with great eloquence, he took his seat among the most <lb/>
            learned officers of the court who had the administration of <lb/>
            affairs. But while thus applying himself to secular affairs <lb/>
            he never diverted his mind from the contemplation of <lb/>
            heavenly love.</p>
          <p>As on him rested the hope of continuing the line of his <lb/>
            father's family, he was induced by the frequent well-intended <lb/>
            instances of his friends to choose a wife of fitting birth. <lb/>
            Marrying for the sake of offspring and not for carnal <lb/>
            pleasure, he frequently meditated on the divine precepts, <note type="footnote"> 1 Mabillon places the birth of St. Evroult in the year 517. The <lb/>
            flourishing state of the church of Bayeux during the first half of the sixth <lb/>
            century is very remarkable. It then produced the two first heads of <lb/>
            monastic establishments in Normandy, St. Marcellus and St. Evroult. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. CH.IX. </note> <lb/>
            which he devoutly fulfilled. The man of God thus fully <lb/>
            enjoyed temporal blessings, while using great care not <lb/>
            to displease his Maker in the use of his benefits ; and be­ <lb/>
            coming very wealthy, delighted more in good works than in <lb/>
            the abundance of his possessions. It was his anxious study <lb/>
            to transfer to himself the virtues of the old fathers of whom <lb/>
            he read accounts in many volumes. Multiplying his alms, <lb/>
            and prayers, and vigils, he induced his wife to join him in <lb/>
            the same holy course, so that, herself pious, her piety was <lb/>
            increased by that of her husband. Thus living, though as <lb/>
            yet a layman, he seemed scarcely to differ from those who <lb/>
            were under the restraints of monastic discipline.</p>
          <p>While this blessed man was thus worthily living under a <lb/>
            certain rule of his own, and zealously submitting to the <lb/>
            evangelical precepts, he happened to be struck with what <lb/>
            was said by our Lord to his disciples in the gospel: " If <lb/>
            any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take <lb/>
            up his cross, and follow me.”1 The man of God had deeply <lb/>
            stored in his mind, as the sum of perfection, that which <lb/>
            truth itself promises to the contemners of this world: <lb/>
            " Verily, I say unto you, that ye which have forsaken all <lb/>
            things for my name's sake shall receive an hundredfold, <lb/>
            and shall inherit eternal life."2 Inflamed by these divine <lb/>
            promises Evroult no longer confined himself within the <lb/>
            boundary of his former discretion, but sold all that he had, <lb/>
            and gave whatever was in his power to the poor. The wife <lb/>
            he had married in order to become a father, he caused to take <lb/>
            the veil, espoused to a heavenly husband, whilst he himself <lb/>
            hastened to a monastery, like one escaped from shipwreck, <lb/>
            and becoming a monk remained there for some time serving <lb/>
            God in all humility; and the love of that holy state of life <lb/>
            increased in him more and more.</p>
          <p>The author of his life has not told us the name of the <lb/>
            monastery to which the holy man retired. I think it, there­ <lb/>
            fore, worth while shortly to note for the information of <lb/>
            posterity what I have learnt from the reports of old persons <lb/>
            respecting it. The venerable Martin, abbot of Vertou,3 had <note type="footnote"> 1 Luke ix. 23. </note><note type="footnote">2 Matthew xix. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The history of this saint may be found in the Acta SS. ord. Benedicti, <lb/>
            sæc. i. p. 371. He was a native of Nantes, and founded the abbey of <lb/>
            Yertou, near that city, about the 24th of October, 600. </note> <pb n="275"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 560—596.]"/> <lb/>
            founded a monastery in a place which from ancient times <lb/>
            was commonly called Deux Jumeaux,1 from the restoration <lb/>
            to life of the twins which old accounts represent to have <lb/>
            taken place there. For the twin children of a powerful lord <lb/>
            had died prematurely and without baptism, which occasioned <lb/>
            excessive sorrow to both their parents. But the blessed <lb/>
            Martin, on his return from England, found his friends <lb/>
            plunged in grief, and, imploring Heaven to give them relief, <lb/>
            restored the twins to life by his prayers and merits, and <lb/>
            dedicated them to God as monks on their own property. <lb/>
            The village preserves to the present day the ancient name <lb/>
            it derived from this occurrence, and great masses of stones, <lb/>
            which formed the foundations of buildings, and ruined walls, <lb/>
            prove that the territory of Bayeux was formerly the residence <lb/>
            of men of great dignity. It is reported that Evroult, while <lb/>
            yet a layman possessed of great wealth and honours, was a <lb/>
            liberal contributor to the erection of this monastery. He <lb/>
            aided with his counsel those who undertook it, encouraged <lb/>
            the hesitating, and forwarded the new work by supplying <lb/>
            funds, and in various other ways. At length he stripped <lb/>
            himself of every thing, and retiring there became truly <lb/>
            one of the poor in Christ, embracing the monastic rule, <lb/>
            and engaging in the Christian warfare with the arms of <lb/>
            obedience, so that he was a bright example to all observers.</p>
          <p>When, however, the glorious confessor Evroult began to <lb/>
            be honoured by the brethren on account of the grace of <lb/>
            sanctity, he felt the danger he incurred of self-elation, and <lb/>
            determined without delay to plunge into the wilderness and <lb/>
            devote himself altogether to the contemplation of God, <lb/>
            taking with him three monks who were attached to him by a <lb/>
            familiar intercourse, and were as he knew well fitted for the <lb/>
            struggle after the highest perfection. Passing therefore <lb/>
            through the district of Exmes, they came to a place called <lb/>
            Montfort,2 and resting there, because the spot was pleasant <lb/>
            and abounded with woods and springs, they led for awhile a <lb/>
            solitary life according to the rules of holiness. But as there <note type="footnote"> 1 In the canton of Isigni. It is possible that a monastery may have <lb/>
            existed in this place in the sixth century, and even that St. Evroult may <lb/>
            have assumed the habit there. But it could not have been under St. <lb/>
            Martin de Vertou, whose foundation was not anterior to that of St. Evroult. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 St. Evroult de Montfort, half a league north of Gacé. </note> <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>

            were two castles in the neighbourhood, Exmes and Gacé1 to <lb/>
            which a number of people were attracted by judicial proceed­ <lb/>
            ings, the servants of God were often exposed to inter­ <lb/>
            ruptions by the resort of so many strangers. It is reported <lb/>
            that these towns existed in the time of Cesar2 and stoutly <lb/>
            resisted him, and that they were the seats of princes for <lb/>
            many ages. It now happened that numbers of persons of <lb/>
            all ranks, both high and low, to whom the noble lord was <lb/>
            known when he was in an exalted station, came to visit him <lb/>
            while he was fervently devoting himself to heavenly con­ <lb/>
            templations, and by their multiplied conversations on affairs <lb/>
            in which they were interested, disturbed his mind when he <lb/>
            was meditating on divine things. The venerable men there­ <lb/>
            fore quitted the spot; on which a church was afterwards built <lb/>
            in honour of St. Evroult, which is standing at this day.</p>
          <p>In their ardour for a hermit's life, the monks then struck <lb/>
            into a forest which the people of the neighbourhood call <lb/>
            Ouche. It was fearfully gloomy from its depth of shade, <lb/>
            the frequent resort of robbers after their predatory excur­ <lb/>
            sions, and the abode of ferocious animals.3 However, they <lb/>
            traversed its vast solitudes with fearless steps, without being <lb/>
            able to find a spot suited to their devotional purposes, <lb/>
            when at length St. Evroult, in the fervour of his pure spirit, <lb/>
            prayed to the Lord, saying: " O Lord Jesus Christ, who <lb/>
            shewedst thyself to thy people Israel as their faithful guide <lb/>

            escape the condemnation of Egyptian servitude, a place of <lb/>
            liberty and an asylum for our weakness." Scarcely had be <lb/>
            finished his prayer when an angel of the Lord appeared to <lb/>
            the holy man, commissioned to point out what he desired. <lb/>
            Following his guidance, the solitaries came to springs well suit­ <lb/>
            ed for drinking, which, issuing from several sources shortly <lb/>
            collected in one large pond. Kneeling down on this spot <lb/>
            they offered fervent praises to God their conductor, who never <lb/>
            forgets his servants who trust in him. After this thanks- <lb/>
            giving, theyinvoked the name of the Lord, and built a but with <lb/>
            boughs and leaves, just large enough to shelter its intended <lb/>
            inhabitants; and having made an inclosure round it by a <lb/>
            slight fence of the same materials, settled themselves in it, <lb/>
            having obtained the quiet resting place they had long co­ <lb/>
            veted. The freer their service now was, the more acceptable <lb/>
            it proved to be to God. Trampling under their feet all the <lb/>
            turmoils of the world, they gave their thoughts entirely to <lb/>
            heavenly contemplations, and having abandoned all earthly <lb/>
            things, had nothing left but God only. They might well <lb/>
            therefore say with the Psalmist: " Thou art my portion, O <lb/>
            Lord; I have promised to keep thy law." 1 Obedient to the <lb/>
            law of the most high God, they sought him as their only <lb/>
            portion.</p>
          <p>While, however, their whole attention was directed to their <lb/>
            spiritual progress, and neither the wildness of the place nor <lb/>
            fears of savage beasts diverted them from their object, it <lb/>
            happened that one of the robbers who made their resort in <lb/>
            the woods paid them a visit. Admiring their resolution <lb/>
            and perseverance in the service of Christ, he said to them : <lb/>
            " O monks, what disturbances have driven you to take <lb/>
            shelter in these thickets ? How can you venture to make <lb/>
            your abode in such a desert ? You have not chosen a fitting <lb/>
            spot. Do you not know that this is a place for robbers, and <lb/>
            not for hermits ? The inhabitants of this forest live by <lb/>
            plunder, and will not suffer among them those who live by <lb/>
            the labour of their hands. Here you cannot long be safe. <lb/>
            Besides, you will meet with nothing but a barren and <lb/>
            unproductive soil, on which your labour would be spent to <lb/>
            no purpose." To this the venerable father Evroult, as he <lb/>
            was a man of eloquence, replied with reference to each pro- <note type="footnote"> 1 Psalm cxix. 57. </note> <pb n="278"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. CH. IX. </note> <lb/>
            position: " In truth, brother, it is no swelling tumult, but <lb/>
            the providence of Almighty God which has conducted us <lb/>
            here; nor do we come to usurp this place, but to have more <lb/>
            liberty to bewail our sins. And as the Lord is with us, <lb/>
            having him for our defence, we fear not the threats of men, <lb/>
            since he himself bath said : ' Fear not them which kill the <lb/>
            body, but are not able to kill the soul.’1 As to what you <lb/>
            said last concerning our labours, you should know that the <lb/>
            Lord is able to prepare a table for the sustenance of his <lb/>
            servants in the wilderness. You also, my son, may be par­ <lb/>
            taker of his abundance, if you turn from your evil courses <lb/>
            and promise devoutly to serve the living and true God. <lb/>
            For saith the prophet: ' In the day that the sinner turneth <lb/>
            away from his wickedness, our God shall deliver to oblivion <lb/>
            all the evil that he bath done.’2 Do not despair therefore, <lb/>
            my brother, of the goodness of God on account of the enor­ <lb/>
            mity of your sins, but follow the admonition of the Psalmist: <lb/>
            ' Flee from evil and do good,’3 understanding of a surety that <lb/>
            ' the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are <lb/>
            open unto their prayers.' But I would not have you igno­ <lb/>
            rant that the same passage contains a terrible threat: ' The <lb/>
            countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil, to <lb/>
            root out the remembrance of them from the earth.’4 If the <lb/>
            regards of divine mercy are present with the just, it is <lb/>
            doubtless plain that they must be turned away from the <lb/>
            unjust, that their wickedness may be some time severely <lb/>
            punished." The robber, touched to the heart by grace from <lb/>
            above as he listened to this discourse, presently departed. <lb/>
            When however morning was come, he left all that he had, <lb/>
            and, taking with him only three cakes, baked on the embers, <lb/>
            and a honey-comb, returned with hasty steps to the servants <lb/>
            of God, and throwing himself at the feet of St. Evroult made <lb/>
            a holy offering, and shortly afterwards, inspired by the Holy <lb/>
            Ghost, promised to amend his life and there first assumed <lb/>
            the profession of a monk. Following his example many <lb/>
            robbers, who infested the same forest, either became monks <lb/>
            through the preaching of the holy man, or abandoning their <lb/>
            life of rapine became cultivators of the soil. His fame and <lb/>
            merits being noised abroad, some came to him also from the <note type="footnote"> 1 Matthew x. 28. </note><note type="footnote">2 Ezek. xviii. 21. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Psalm xxxiv. 14. </note><note type="footnote">4 Psalm xxxiv. 17. </note> <pb n="279"/>

            neighbouring districts desiring to see his angelical counte­ <lb/>
            nance and hear his delightful discourse. They supplied him <lb/>
            with things necessary for his bodily wants and returned home <lb/>
            with joyful hearts refreshed with his spiritual gifts. Some <lb/>
            of them also entreated him to admit them into his holy com­ <lb/>
            pany that they might have the advantage of constant inter­ <lb/>
            course with him, so that from the numbers who frequented <lb/>
            it, the forest soon lost its character for solitude.</p>
          <p>As the number of the brethren increased, so also grace and <lb/>
            virtue increased in the blessed Evroult. His patience was <lb/>
            singular, his abstinence remarkable, his prayers incessant, <lb/>
            his exhortations fervent. He did not permit himself to be <lb/>
            elated by prosperity nor cast down by adversity. What <lb/>
            was brought to him by pious people who flocked about him <lb/>
            he ordered to be distributed to the poor, saying that monks <lb/>
            ought not to be anxious for the morrow.</p>
          <p>One day when there was not sufficient bread, a poor man <lb/>
            came to the gate and asked for alms. As the minister to <lb/>
            whom he applied informed him that they had nothing to <lb/>
            give him, the venerable father said : " Brother, why do you <lb/>
            disregard the cries of the needy ? give alms, I pray you, to <lb/>
            this poor man." Upon which he answered; “ My father, I <lb/>
            have only half a loaf which I have kept for our poor children, <lb/>
            all the rest I have distributed according to your orders." <lb/>
            But he said; " Son, you ought not to hesitate, have you not <lb/>
            read what the prophet saith: ' Blessed is he that considereth <lb/>
            the poor and needy; the Lord shall deliver him in the time <lb/>
            of trouble ?' 1 Never, indeed, will the faithful Creator of all <lb/>
            things fail to nourish those for whom he condescended to <lb/>
            shed his precious blood, nailed to the cross." The minister <lb/>
            on hearing these words of the venerable father gave the half <lb/>
            loaf which he had reserved for the children to one of the <lb/>
            servants, saying: " Run quickly, and give this to the poor <lb/>
            man, but do not call him back." The servant, in obedience <lb/>
            to his commands, ran after the poor man until he overtook <lb/>
            him at the distance of almost a stadium from the monastery, <lb/>
            and addressed him saying: " Take, master, the alms which <lb/>
            the abbot sends you," whereupon he stuck in the ground <lb/>
            the stafl' which he carried, and received the offering of cha­ <lb/>
            rity in both hands. But when he withdrew the staff which <note type="footnote"> 1 Psalm xli. 1. </note> <pb n="280"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. CH. IX. </note> <lb/>
            lie had planted in the ground, before the bearer of the alms <lb/>
            had left the spot a plentiful spring of water suddenly burst <lb/>
            forth on the spot following the point of the staff, and it con­ <lb/>
            tinues flowing there to the present day.1 Many diseases have <lb/>
            been cured at that place, and persons afflicted with fevers <lb/>
            are attracted from distant quarters in the hope of obtaining <lb/>
            relief. Many also received visions commanding them to <lb/>
            seek out the forest of Ouche, and, for the recovery of their <lb/>
            health, drink of the spring which flows there. Several came <lb/>
            from Burgundy, Aquitaine, and other parts of France, and <lb/>
            made inquiries for Ouche under great difficulties, for the <lb/>
            place was desert and unknown, so that it was scarcely pos­ <lb/>
            sible to find it out. When at length they had discovered <lb/>
            the fountain, and drawn the water and drunk it in faith, <lb/>
            invoking the holy name, or bathed the head or limbs, they <lb/>
            had the happiness to recover their health, and giving thanks <lb/>
            to God, returned joyfully home.</p>
          <p>Miracles were wrought at this place for many ages, until <lb/>
            the times of Henry, king of France,2 when, in consequence <lb/>
            of the ravages during the Danish invasions, the district of <lb/>
            Ouche had become thinly populated, and was thrown out of <lb/>
            cultivation. At that time a certain peasant named Beranger <lb/>
            succeeded by inheritance to that farm, and inclosed the <lb/>
            spring with a hedge to prevent the sick people who resorted <lb/>
            to it from treading down his crops ; for the farmer was often <lb/>
            incensed and grieved because his meadows, gardens, and all <lb/>
            his land round about were trampled upon by strangers who <lb/>
            flocked there for the benefit of their health. Thenceforth <lb/>
            miracles of healing ceased to be performed as long as <lb/>
            Beranger and his heirs, Lethier, William, and Gervase, <lb/>
            possessed the farm. <note type="footnote"> 1 About a league from the abbey there is a hollow in the wood <lb/>
            covered with green sward, and shaded by scattered forest trees, beneath <lb/>
            which the spring mentioned in the legend bursts forth, still bearing the <lb/>
            name of the, fountain of St. Evroult. Its cool and pellucid waters <lb/>
            collected in a large tank of solid masonry, are still resorted to by pilgrims <lb/>
            and sick persons in reliance on their virtues. On the bank above stands <lb/>
            a little chapel, with a statue of the saint in a niche over the door. The <lb/>
            building had fallen to decay, but was under repair in the autumn of 1853, <lb/>
            the bishop of Se6z being expected to re-open it with solemn services in the <lb/>
            ensuing summer. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 July 20, 1031—August 29, 1060. </note> <pb n="281"/>

          <p>St. Evroult, having caused the bread to be given to the <lb/>
            poor man, lo! before sunset a beast of burden was seen to <lb/>
            stop before the door of the cell with a full load of bread <lb/>
            and wine. The conductor called the minister; and, saying <lb/>
            that he was a borrower at usury, delivered to him what he <lb/>
            had brought, adding, " Go, brother, and give it to your <lb/>
            abbot:" so saying, he mounted the horse, as if to hasten <lb/>
            his journey, and quickly departed; so that, when the holy <lb/>
            father wished to see him, he was told with what despatch he <lb/>
            had taken his leave. He therefore understood that the <lb/>
            provisions were sent by God ; and, rejoicing in spirit, gave <lb/>
            thanks to His unbounded loving kindness, who magnifies his <lb/>
            mercy to his servants, and makes a rich return for small <lb/>
            offerings. From that day there never failed to be a sufficient <lb/>
            supply of what human wants required.</p>
          <p>The temporal goods of the new society, through the <lb/>
            merciful providence of the Lord, beginning to increase, two <lb/>
            fierce robbers from another province, hearing that their sub­ <lb/>
            stance was multiplied, directed their steps towards the cell <lb/>
            of the holy man, and seizing a herd of swine, hastened to <lb/>
            make their escape from the forest; but, instead of doing <lb/>
            so, found themselves repeatedly following the same track in <lb/>
            a circuit round the inclosure. Being unable to discover <lb/>
            any free way of exit, they were astonished at what happened ; <lb/>
            when, just as they were worn out with wandering, they <lb/>
            heard the bell which summoned the brethren to assemble to <lb/>
            their usual office of prayer.1 The sound struck them with <lb/>
            excessive terror, and leaving the swine, they came with all <lb/>
            haste to the man of God, and, confessing the crime of which <lb/>
            they had been guilty, became monks on the spot.</p>
          <p>To render the glory of the master more conspicuous, we <lb/>
            must not omit what the sevenfold grace of the Spirit per­ <lb/>
            formed by means of one of the disciples of so illustrious a <lb/>
            saint. A crow which had built its nest near the monastery, <lb/>
            secretly stole eggs, and getting into the refectory by one of <lb/>
            the windows, put everything in disorder, and carried off to <lb/>
            its nest all that it found. Then one of the brethren, whose <note type="footnote"> I This circumstance concurs with others of the same kind mentioned by <lb/>
            Gregory of Tours, to prove that the use of bells in the. western church was <lb/>
            far anterior to the time of Pope Sabinian to which its introduction is <lb/>
            frequently attributed. </note> <pb n="282"/>

            duty it was to look after the refectory, praying with sim­ <lb/>
            plicity, said : " O Lord, avenge us of the enemy who carries <lb/>
            off what thy mercy has bestowed on us." And the bird <lb/>
            was forthwith found dead under the tree where she had <lb/>
            made her nest. Thus whoever attempted to injure the <lb/>
            monks, either quickly perished, or, repenting of it, engaged <lb/>
            in a better course of life.</p>
          <p>God, who beholds all things, regarding with favour the <lb/>
            glorious conflict of his beloved servant Evroult, strength­ <lb/>
            ened his heart with all the firmness of faith, that, persevering <lb/>
            in his good work, he might become a model of regular <lb/>
            discipline to others. He, indeed, longed to retire to the <lb/>
            deepest recesses of the wilderness, and free himself entirely <lb/>
            from human companionship ; but wiser counsels led him to <lb/>
            consider how best his presence might profit the band of <lb/>
            combatants, whose leader and master he had become. <lb/>
            Fearing, therefore, that if he, the founder of the establish­ <lb/>
            ment, withdrew, the work, in its infant state, would receive a <lb/>
            shock, he took precautions that he might not cause injury <lb/>
            to others, while he was providing a quiet retreat for himself.</p>
          <p>In consequence, as the general of this militant body, he <lb/>
            remained at his post, fighting in the ranks as a private <lb/>
            soldier, and also exalting himself by his eminent virtues as <lb/>
            a brave commander in front of the ranks. His great <lb/>
            reputation for sanctity, being spread abroad through many <lb/>
            provinces, attracted numbers of wealthy, resolute, and God­ <lb/>
            fearing persons, to enrol themselves for the same conflict. <lb/>
            They surrendered to the holy man, their houses, farms, <lb/>
            possessions, and families, entreating him to cause monas­ <lb/>
            teries to be built for them ; and that, as their wise pastor, <lb/>
            he would give them a rule under which to live. The saint <lb/>
            granted their petitions, and founded fifteen monasteries for <lb/>
            men and women, with regular institutions, appointing a <lb/>
            person of approved conduct to govern each. He himself <lb/>
            continued to preside over the convent which he first built, <lb/>
            exhorting the brethren to make a loftier progress, and to <lb/>
            shun the multiform snares of the devil. At length the <lb/>
            fame of the sanctity of so eminent a father reached the ears <lb/>
            of the princes who then held the reins of government among <lb/>
            the Franks, recently brought into subjection to the light <lb/>
            yoke of Christianity.</p><pb n="283"/>

          <p>Clotaire the elder reigned fifty-one years,' and at his <lb/>

            Caribert fixed the seat of his government at Paris, Chilperic <lb/>

            Justinian and Justin the younger, Tiberius, Maurice, <lb/>
            Phocas, and IIeraclius were emperors of Rome ;2 and the <lb/>

            I have not found in books, but have learned from stories <lb/>

            profound wisdom contained in the works of their spiritual <lb/>

            modern times to retrace them are fruitless, these ancient <lb/>
            monuments having disappeared with the revolutions of the <lb/>
            world from the memory of men, like hail or snow lost in the <lb/>
            waters of some rapid river, and flowing onward, past <lb/>
            recovery, in its mingled current.1</p>
          <p>The names of the places at which father Evroult founded <lb/>
            the fifteen monasteries, and of the fathers he set over the <lb/>
            religious societies, as vicars of Christ, have been lost in the <lb/>
            various revolutions of four hundred years, during the reigns <lb/>
            of the numerous kings who have governed France from <lb/>
            Lothaire the Great and Childebert to Philip and his son <lb/>
            Lewis.2 Nevertheless, some old men, bowed down with <lb/>
            years, have related to their sons with natural garrulity what <lb/>
            they saw and heard, which these again retained by strong <lb/>
            efforts of a tenacious memory, and handed down to the <lb/>
            succeding age. These traditions of things worthy of <lb/>
            remembrance they make known to their brethren, thereby <lb/>
            stirring up the hard hearts of men to the love of their <lb/>
            Creator, and not hiding their talent in the earth with the <lb/>
            useless servant, and incurring his condemnation. Listen, <lb/>
            then, to what I heard myself, when a boy, from our old <lb/>
            fathers, and magnify with me the wonderful works of <lb/>
            God in his saints.</p>
          <p>The fame of the holy father Evroult being noised abroad <lb/>
            far and near, reached the ears of Childebert king of France, <lb/>
            who, impelled by a strong desire to see him, undertook a <lb/>
            journey to Ouche with his wife and some of his family.3 <lb/>
            Approaching the monastery of the man of God, at the <lb/>
            place where the church dedicated to St. Mary, mother of <lb/>
            God, now stands,4 he dismounted from his horse, and com- <note type="footnote"> 1 This noble image recalls to memory a passage in the bible which con­ <lb/>

            manded all to prepare themselves duly for meeting the <lb/>
            saint. Then the clerks who were in his train stood ready in <lb/>
            their vestments, laying their hands on the crosses and relics <lb/>
            which they had spread on palls; but when they attempted <lb/>
            to remove them, they could by no means do so. All, there­ <lb/>
            fore, in great tribulution, threw themselves on the ground, <lb/>
            and humbly prayed for God's mercy. The queen, also, <lb/>
            bound herself by a vow, saying: " If Almighty God shall <lb/>
            give us the power of safely removing the holy things which <lb/>
            we have here deposited, I will cause a venerable church to <lb/>
            be built on this spot in honour of his mother." After she <lb/>
            had said this, the clerks again laid their hands on the sacred <lb/>
            things, but to no purpose. Then the queen was very <lb/>
            sorrowful, and said with tears: " I know that I deserve for <lb/>
            my sins not to see the servant of God; but if God the <lb/>
            Creator of all things shall, by the intercession of the saint <lb/>
            himself, take pity on us, and permit us to remove the holy <lb/>
            relics, I will have a marble altar made at my own expense, <lb/>
            and cause it to be brought to the holy man." When she had <lb/>
            uttered these words, all the relics moved of themselves, and <lb/>
            they took them up, and went in joyful procession to meet <lb/>
            the man of God. Already the blessed man was on his way, <lb/>
            attended by a body of the monks ; and a crowd of people of <lb/>
            both sexes hastened with him in great triumph towards the <lb/>
            king. Being received into the monastery, the king <lb/>
            remained there three days. On the third day he signed a <lb/>
            charter granting ninety-nine vills to St. Evroult, and then <lb/>
            returned homewards rejoicing.</p>
          <p>The queen, remembering her vow, caused a church to be <lb/>
            built in honour of Mary, mother of God, always a virgin, on <lb/>
            the hill which stands between the rivulet of Charenton and <lb/>
            the wood,' and also sent the marble altar which she promised <lb/>
            to the venerable man, which remained for many years in the <note type="footnote"> overlooking the valley in which the abbey of St. Evroult stood on the other <lb/>
            side of the river. The French editor of Ordericus here corrects a note <lb/>
            which is inserted in vol. i. p. 399, describing this church as having been <lb/>
            originally the mother-church of the parish in which the abbey was built. <lb/>
            However that may be, it is the parish church at the present day. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The church of Notre-Dame-du-Bois stands on the side of the hill <lb/>
            above the Charenton, and must formerly have been surrounded by the <lb/>
            forest, the verge of which in the course of time has receded to some little <lb/>
            distance. </note> <pb n="287"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 582—596.]"/> <lb/>
            same place. Long afterwards, in the course of years, a <lb/>
            worthless fellow attempted to transfer part of the marble <lb/>
            to another place; but it happened to break in the middle. <lb/>
            It was plain to all that this act was displeasing to God, and <lb/>
            he did not suffer it to remain long unpunished, for before <lb/>
            the year was past the man lost his life.</p>
          <p>In the church built by the queen, as I have just stated, <lb/>
            two altars were consecrated; one of them dedicated to the <lb/>
            Holy and Undivided Trinity the other to the pure virgin <lb/>
            mother of God. It is reported that there was there a <lb/>
            convent of monks, and a cemetery for the monks and men <lb/>
            of distinction. Their bodies were carried thither for inter­ <lb/>
            ment, because the ground in the valley was marshy, and in <lb/>
            the winter wherever it was dug, the water forthwith sprung <lb/>
            up, and, overflowing, filled the graves. Traces of a building <lb/>
            of importance are discovered near the church of the Virgin <lb/>
            Mother, and to this day stately tombs are preserved there, <lb/>
            which are believed to have certainly belonged to eminent <lb/>
            persons. After this description, I proceed to relate what <lb/>
            further remains.</p>
          <p>The man of God, seeing that he could not bear the crowds <lb/>
            of people who flocked to him, set his convent in order, and <lb/>
            withdrawing from it privately, concealed himself for three <lb/>
            years in a crypt, so that none of the monks knew where he <lb/>
            was, except one whose name was Malchus, a godson of the <lb/>
            saint, who knew his secrets better than the rest. The crypt <lb/>
            stood by the side of a rivulet under a wooded hill, and was <lb/>
            almost half a league distant from the monastery.1 Mean­ <lb/>
            while, the devil, that enemy of all that is excellent, perceiving <lb/>
            that the brethren were growing in good works, sought to <lb/>
            fill them with the gall of bitterness, and to cause lamenta­ <lb/>
            ble disturbances among them. He therefore raised a <lb/>
            tumult, which was carried so far that two were killed and <lb/>
            the rest were plunged in unutterable grief. When the god­ <lb/>
            son of the holy man perceived this incurable wound in the <lb/>
            body of the brethren, he ran with all haste to the abbot. <lb/>
            The man of God, seeing him from a distance thus running, <lb/>
            concluded that it was not without reason he made such <lb/>
            haste, and going to meet him inquired the cause of his <note type="footnote"> 1 This crypt was probably in the neighbourhood of the fountain of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, described in a former note. </note> <pb n="288"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.YI. CH. IX."/> <lb/>
            coming. Upon this, Malchus related at length how the <lb/>
            monks had been stirred up to insurrection by the instigation <lb/>
            of the devil. Hearing this, the holy man, inflamed with zeal <lb/>
            for God, shuddered, and hastened to accompany the ines­ <lb/>
            senger on his return. When he drew near to the convent, <lb/>
            and had reached the spot where the church founded in <lb/>
            honour of him now stands, all the bells of the monastery <lb/>
            began to ring of their own accord. So also did the bells in <lb/>
            the church of St. Mary, and in that of St. Martin, called <lb/>
            The Elegant, at a place commonly called La Bercoterie.</p>
          <p>Then the devil, perceiving that the saint was come, as­ <lb/>
            sumed a human form, and began to flee. The holy man <lb/>
            seeing this, said to his godson: " My brother, do you see <lb/>
            that man running?" He replied, “ My lord, I see no <lb/>
            one." Then said the saint, "Lo, the devil flees, trans­ <lb/>
            figured into the form of a man, and fearing to remain any <lb/>
            longer in this place." As he said this, he pursued Belial <lb/>
            as he fled; but when he was come to the village now called <lb/>
            by the inhabitants, Echaufour, Satan, not having permission <lb/>
            to flee any further, stood still. Upon which the blessed <lb/>
            Evroult boldly went up to him, and threw him into a fiery <lb/>
            oven which was heated in readiness for baking bread, and <lb/>
            immediately closed its mouth with an iron stopper which <lb/>
            he chanced to find. From this circumstance the place took <lb/>
            its name of Echaufour.1 The women who had brought their <lb/>
            loaves to be baked, seeing with astonishment what was done, <lb/>
            said to the man of God, " What, sir, shall we do with our <lb/>
            loaves ?" To which he replied, " God is able to bake your <lb/>
            loaves without corporeal fire; clear well the hearth before <lb/>
            the oven, and lay your loaves in order upon it, and when <lb/>
            they are thoroughly baked, depart to your homes, which <lb/>
            was done accordingly; all who saw it giving glory to God. <lb/>
            Then the blessed Evroult returned to his monastery and <lb/>
            having commanded the two monks who had been killed <lb/>
            to be brought before him, laid himself prostrate on the <note type="footnote"> 1 From echauffer, to beat; four, an oven. Echaufour is a small bourg, <lb/>
            with a fine old church, on the verge of the forest, about three leagues from <lb/>
            St. Evroult, the monks of which had large possessions in the parish. <lb/>
            There was a castle here, probably on the site of the present chateau, about <lb/>
            a mile from the village, which was the scene of a surprise described in <lb/>
            vol. i. p. 433. </note> <pb n="289"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 582—596.]"/> <lb/>
            ground, and continued praying until such time as the <lb/>
            brethren were roused from the sleep of death. Having con­ <lb/>
            fessed and communicated with the Lord's body, they again <lb/>
            gave up the ghost, to the joy and astonishment of all who <lb/>
            saw it. The venerable father ordered them to have honour­ <lb/>
            able burial, and being assured of their salvation, gave devout <lb/>
            thanks to God.</p>
          <p>Old men report these and many such miracles performed <lb/>
            by Evroult, adding that they had seen at Ouche a very aged <lb/>
            monk named Natalis, who had a large volume filled with <lb/>
            accounts of the miracles and actions of this servant of the <lb/>
            Lord. One day, mass being ended, a lighted candle was <lb/>
            carelessly left on the altar, and while the attendants were busy <lb/>
            about other matters, the wick burnt down till it set fire <lb/>
            to a napkin, and the flame caught the altar-cloth, which was <lb/>
            utterly destroyed, as well as the book, of which we have <lb/>
            never been able to discover another copy; and every thing <lb/>
            on and about the altar which was of a combustible nature <lb/>
            was burnt. All joined in lamenting this irreparable loss <lb/>
            of the record of past events: but as the monks were illite­ <lb/>
            rate, they did not supply it by writing, but transmitted <lb/>
            verbally to the younger members of the society the particu­ <lb/>
            lars of what they had seen and heard. When they were <lb/>
            removed by death, the thick clouds of ignorance overspread <lb/>
            their successors, and hid under an impenetrable veil the <lb/>
            knowledge of past events, except only what some erudite <lb/>
            man made, a short abstract of the life of St. Evroult to be <lb/>
            read in the church. Having already inserted in my work <lb/>
            the first part of this recital, I will now proceed to relate <lb/>
            from it the end of the holy father's life and labours in a <lb/>
            profitable manner without any false colouring.</p>
          <p>Twenty-two years having passed since the monks began <lb/>
            their settlement in the depth of the wilderness, the monas­ <lb/>
            tery was subjected to the ravages of a plague producing <lb/>
            sudden death, by the assaults of the great deceiver of man­ <lb/>
            kind.1 The blessed Evroult did not act as a mercenary who <note type="footnote"> 1 The same plague appears to have ravaged at this time the rising <lb/>
            convent of Glanfeuil, now St. Maur-sur-Loire. It is also mentioned by <lb/>
            Gregory of Tours as having prevailed in 580. The- date here given by <lb/>
            our author enabled Mabillon to calculate the time of the establishment of <lb/>
            St. Evroult in the forest of Ouche, which he fixed in 560. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> u </note> <pb n="290"/>

            took to flight and left the sheep in the midst of the solves, <lb/>
            but like a true shepherd, engaged with them in the conflict, <lb/>
            and, fulfilling the apostle's admonition, "rejoiced with them <lb/>
            that did rejoice, and wept with them that did weep.”1 Ad­ <lb/>
            dressing them in words of exhortation, he said, " Brethren, <lb/>
            strengthen your hearts, and be prepared. Be courageous <lb/>
            and comforted in the Lord, knowing that tribulation worketh <lb/>
            patience.2 Be renewed in the spirit of your minds and <lb/>
            fight against the old serpent. Be of one heart and one <lb/>
            mind in the Lord. Behold the day of our vocation is near, <lb/>
            when our works shall be made manifest, and the righteous <lb/>
            Judge will give to every man according to his merits. Watch, <lb/>
            then, and pray, for ye know neither the day nor the hour. <lb/>
            Blessed is that servant who, when the Lord cometh, shall be <lb/>
            found watching." By these and such like evangelical dis­ <lb/>
            courses, the wise preacher addressed himself to the con­ <lb/>
            sciences of the brethren, enlarging on the joys prepared for <lb/>
            the good, and the torments which awaited evil doers.</p>
          <p>Sudden deaths becoming frequent, it happened, in order <lb/>
            to exhibit in a clearer light the powers of the saint, that one <lb/>
            of the monks named Ansbert died without receiving the <lb/>
            viaticum. The brother who had the care of him immediately <lb/>
            came to the abbot, saying : " Father, pray for your son who <lb/>
            has just departed out of this life most unhappily. Let your <lb/>
            intercessions prevail to bring him safely on the way, seeing <lb/>
            that he was not strengthened for it by the communion of the <lb/>
            blessed sacrament. St. Evroult severely blamed himself for <lb/>
            this occurrence, as if it happened from his own negligence, and <lb/>
            hastening to the bed of the deceased, shed tears, and threw <lb/>
            himself in the dust, using the arms of prayer, on which he <lb/>
            relied. When however he felt within himself the presence <lb/>
            of the divine power, he arose from the earth, and called on <lb/>
            the dead man. At the sound of that voice, he who had lost <lb/>
            his sight raised his head and opened his eyes, and perceiving <lb/>
            the restorer of his freedom, said, " Welcome, my liberator, <lb/>
            welcome! your prayers have saved me, having unravelled <lb/>
            the devices of the enemy, who had claimed me as his own, <lb/>
            because he found me without communion. Shut out from <lb/>
            the feast of the blessed, I was condemned, as not having <lb/>
            received the viaticum to the torments of cruel hunger. <note type="footnote"> 1 Rom. xii. IS. </note><note type="footnote">2 Rom. vii. 3. </note> <pb n="291"/>
            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 582—596.]"/>
          <p>Wherefore, kind father, I pray you not to delay allowing <lb/>
            me to partake of the life-giving host." Need I say more ? <lb/>
            The sacrament was ordered to be brought, and as soon as he <lb/>
            had received it, while all were wondering at his revival, he <lb/>
            again gave up the ghost by the wise dispensation of God. <lb/>
            The glorious saint exults in the certainty of the brother's <lb/>
            salvation; the monks exult, praising God for this new <lb/>
            miracle. Evroult rejoiced because he had restored to life, <lb/>
            by the accepted way, a brother snatched from death; the <lb/>
            monks rejoiced that they had a father at whose prayers hell <lb/>
            trembled. Great as they felt the perils of the pestilence <lb/>
            which threatened them with destruction, with such a leader <lb/>
            and guide they were encouraged to be less fearful of being <lb/>
            cut off unprepared. However, the mortality was so great, <lb/>
            that eighty-eight of the monks died of the pestilence, and <lb/>
            the loss among the domestics was not less.</p>
          <p>I must not pass over in silence what happened to one of <lb/>
            the number, a most useful officer of the abbey, who breathed <lb/>
            his last on the very day of our Lord's nativity. Everything <lb/>
            having been properly arranged for his funeral, he was borne <lb/>
            forth from the monastery to the spot where the place of burial <lb/>
            lay. There the corpse was deposited until the mass was <lb/>
            finished preparatory to its being committed to the grave. <lb/>
            The whole society grieved for the loss of so worthy a servant. <lb/>
            He was a most active steward, and managed the affairs of <lb/>
            the monks with great industry, so that he was held in high <lb/>
            esteem by them all. While they were thus plunged in <lb/>
            general grief, St. Evroult felt the Holy Spirit conceived <lb/>
            within him, and trembling with awe, while he compassionated <lb/>
            the sorrow of the brethren, had recourse to his familiar <lb/>
            remedies. His prayers were fervent, he smote his breast, <lb/>
            and he shed tears, and continued his intercessions until <lb/>
            such time as the domestic for whom they were offered rose <lb/>
            to life and threw himself at the holy father's feet, giving <lb/>
            thanks for his restoration. Then shouts rose to heaven; <lb/>
            the name of the Holy Trinity was blessed by all, and Evroult <lb/>
            was acknowledged to be illustrious and apostolical, because <lb/>
            he raised the dead. The servant restored to life resumed <lb/>
            his duties, and lived for many years afterwards. At length, <lb/>
            through divine mercy, this fatal pestilence terminated.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, however, the mortality ceased, the <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <pb n="292"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. CH. IX. </note> <lb/>
            good shepherd continued to pray for the departed, believing <lb/>
            that true charity is more concerned about the soul than <lb/>
            about the body. Although his head was become grey with <lb/>
            venerable age, he was far from being bowed down by the <lb/>
            burden of years, but prolonged his labours of reading and <lb/>
            praying into the night, according to what the psalmist says <lb/>
            amongst other descriptions of the man who is blessed: " He <lb/>
            meditates in the law of the Lord both day and night."l <lb/>
            Inflamed with ardent charity, he devoted himself more <lb/>
            zealously to the exercise of all virtues. Though he was <lb/>
            compassionate to sinners, he carefully guarded his own dis­ <lb/>
            course. Neglecting the care of his person, his hair was <lb/>
            cut only three times in a year. He was never known to <lb/>
            return evil for evil. When any loss of transitory things <lb/>
            was reported to him, his constant reply was: " The Lord <lb/>
            hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."2 He <lb/>
            had such a happy art of reconciling differences that, however <lb/>
            much at variance persons came to him, they returned at <lb/>
            peace, soothed by his honeyed words. Indeed, all who <lb/>
            approached him, high and low, poor and pilgrims, met with <lb/>
            a cheerful reception. He made himself pleasant to all, and <lb/>
            seldom any one was permitted to retire from his presence <lb/>
            without receiving some little present. The sick, who <lb/>
            regained their health by his benediction, departed, joy­ <lb/>
            fully giving thanks to God. It was restored to all who <lb/>
            resorted to the holy man in the hope of recovering it. <lb/>
            Many, also, who were so prostrated by the violence of fever <lb/>
            that they could not come into the presence of the saint, sent <lb/>
            messengers to entreat that, of his goodness, he would send <lb/>
            them some token, such as a girdle which he had made him­ <lb/>
            self from rope, or some fragment of his clothing; and those <lb/>
            who handled these things with faith regained their former <lb/>
            health.</p>
          <p>A certain mother of a family, who could not obtain a cure <lb/>
            from any physician, hearing a report of the virtues of the <lb/>
            blessed man, sent to beg the fringe of his garment, and <lb/>
            having received it, she was relieved from her disorder, as <lb/>
            were many others. Behold this admirable physician, who <lb/>
            not only granted the gift of health to those who hastened to <lb/>
            his presence, but failed not when absent to impart it to those <note type="footnote"> i Psalm L 2. </note><note type="footnote">2 Job i. 21. </note> <pb n="293"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 596.] </note> <lb/>
            who were at a distance. Those felt his influence who never <lb/>
            saw his face.</p>
          <p>While all flocked to him in their several necessities, one <lb/>
            poor wretch among the rest came from a strange country. <lb/>
            Perceiving that his whole frame was wasted by severe disease, <lb/>
            and that he was bent to the knees as he walked, the most <lb/>
            compassionate saint said to him : " Brother, how could you <lb/>
            bear the fatigue of such a journey, seeing under what debi­ <lb/>
            lity you labour?" He replied: “ My lord, it was under <lb/>
            compulsion by a double necessity that I determined to come <lb/>
            to your holiness; first, I was hungry and wanted employ­ <lb/>
            ment, and secondly, I was infirm and depended upon you <lb/>
            for a cure." The holy man told him to remain there, and <lb/>
            immediately restoring his health, made him a monk, and set <lb/>
            him to work in the garden. So he who came with two <lb/>
            requests, rejoiced at obtaining three benefits, for he escaped <lb/>
            the danger of famine, found a remedy for his infirmity, and <lb/>
            was admitted to the profession of a better course of life.</p>
          <p>Another pauper presented himself who, though he was in <lb/>
            sound health, pretended to be sick and somewhat palsied, in <lb/>
            order to obtain something more than the others. Presently, <lb/>
            however, when he had received alms from the man of God, <lb/>
            he was struck with fever, what he had feigned becoming a <lb/>
            reality ; and he breathed his last a few days afterwards in <lb/>
            the monastery, having confessed his wicked fraud.</p>
          <p>In the midst of so many striking proofs of his miraculous <lb/>
            powers, the aged soldier of Christ, having attained the age <lb/>
            of eighty years, fervently desired to see the face of him he <lb/>
            had so long served; regarding him as an unbelieving servant <lb/>
            who would wish to avoid the presence of his master. For <lb/>
            forty-seven days, during which he was afflicted with a fever, <lb/>
            he was never seen to take food, except occasionally the <lb/>
            sacrament of the body of the Lord Jesus, and was inces­ <lb/>
            santly engaged in imparting the mysteries of the divine word <lb/>
            to the brethren, as if he suffered no inconvenience. And <lb/>
            when pious persons of the neighbourhood came to see him, <lb/>
            and begged of him to accept something, as an offering of <lb/>
            their love, which might serve to sustain his feeble body, he <lb/>
            said to them: " Cease, brethren, cease from persuading me <lb/>
            to receive what I altogether loathe." Truly he was in no <lb/>
            need of earthly food who was nourished within by the Holy <pb n="294"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. VI. CH.IX."/> <lb/>
            Spirit. lie was fed by the sweet hope of eternal delights, <lb/>
            and assured of enjoying a blessed immortality as the reward <lb/>
            of his labours. At length the day approaching on which it <lb/>
            was his desire to be dissolved and to obtain the wished-for <lb/>
            vision of his Maker, he called together the brethren, and as <lb/>
            they were sorrowing at his departure, and considering what <lb/>
            they should do when their shepherd was dead, lie thus <lb/>
            addressed them: " My children, continue to be of one mind, <lb/>
            united by the bond of charity! Let there be divine love <lb/>
            among you, one toward the other! Be not betrayed into <lb/>
            the deceitful snares of the devil, and study to fulfil your <lb/>
            vows to God! Be lovers of temperance; observe strict con­ <lb/>
            tinence ; cultivate humility; eschew pride, and let each <lb/>
            strive to excel the others in good works! Receive with <lb/>
            benevolence pilgrims and strangers for the sake of Him who <lb/>
            said, 'I was a stranger and ye took me in.’”1</p>
          <p>The glorious Evroult uttering these and other his last <lb/>
            words to the same purpose, and having given his blessing to <lb/>
            the brethren, his most holy soul departed from the body, and <lb/>
            immediately his face shone with so much brightness, that no <lb/>
            one doubted that his free spirit was already triumphing <lb/>
            among the angels in heaven. He left the world on the <lb/>
            fourth of the calends of January [December 29], in the <lb/>
            time of Robert bishop of Seéz, and in the twelfth year of the <lb/>
            reign of King Childebert.2 The brethren carried the corpse <lb/>
            into the church with great reverence, and chanted hymns <lb/>
            and praises to God for three days and nights, while they <lb/>
            carefully watched the holy body, waiting for the assembling <lb/>
            of the servants of God. When it was known at Séez that <lb/>
            the benefactor of the whole country was removed from the <lb/>
            world, all the inhabitants flocked together to the monastery <lb/>
            to have the happiness of being present at his solemn <lb/>
            funeral.3 The poor lamented him who was indeed one of <note type="footnote"> 1 Matt. xxv. 43. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It should be Clotaire, which is the ancient reading of the MS. of St. <lb/>

            All had found him a common friend, and all lamented their <lb/>
            common loss.</p>
          <p>I think I ought not to omit mentioning that remarkable <lb/>
            proof of his goodness which, amongst others, the holy man <lb/>
            gave, when he was now in the enjoyment of eternal light. <lb/>
            One of the brethren, distinguished for his piety and the <lb/>
            grace of obedience, had served in the monastery, and was <lb/>
            raised to the rank of deacon. Evroult loved him much on <lb/>
            account of his merit of sanctity. When this deacon found <lb/>
            that he was deprived of so great a father, he became <lb/>
            overwhelmed with grief, and said: " Alas! wretched man <lb/>
            that I am, what shall I do ? Why, my father, have you left <lb/>
            him whom you confessed you loved ? Why have you suf­ <lb/>
            fered him who was in your entire confidence to be separated <lb/>
            from you ? Do you treat as an enemy him you called your <lb/>
            son ? Assuredly I never deserved that you should wish to <lb/>
            descend into the tomb before me." <lb/>
            “ In sighs and tears thus vented he his grief:”1</p>
          <p>And behold, on the very night of the circumcision of our <lb/>
            Lord, the deacon, by God's will, gave up the ghost. This <lb/>
            plainly appears to have been accomplished through the <lb/>
            intercession of the holy father Evroult, that he whom he <lb/>
            loved might not become the sport of the world, and that he <lb/>
            himself might exhibit his readiness to hear the petitions of <lb/>
            those who invoked his aid. Thus the monk, according to <lb/>
            his wishes, was carried out for burial on the morrow, at the <lb/>
            same time with his abbot. Oh, glorious death, more precious <lb/>
            than life! It secured him in heaven what he lost on earth. <lb/>
            As far as I can conjecture, it was better thus to die than to be <lb/>
            restored from death to life. For now, assured of his salvation, <lb/>
            he has not to fear being defiled by sin. If he were raised up <lb/>
            again, he would have to struggle with uncertain hope against <note type="footnote"> edifice, with one of those deep porches for which the French churches are <lb/>
            remarkable, flanked by two spires, and a nave of the early pointed style. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 " Talia perstabat memorans, lacrymasque ciebat." </note><note type="footnote"> The first part of this verse is taken from Virgil, Æn. ii. 650; the second <lb/>

            dered less than that of the resurrection of dead persons <lb/>
            before related.</p>
          <p>The venerable father Evroult was interred in a marble <lb/>
            tomb of admirable workmanship in the church of St Peter, <lb/>
            prince of the apostles, which he had built himself of stone. <lb/>
            To this day many persons are there healed of their infirmi­ <lb/>
            ties, and by the goodness of our merciful Redeemer the <lb/>
            sorrowful find consolation. To Him be honour and power, <lb/>

          <p>I have thus faithfully described the life of the holy father <lb/>
            Evroult, inserting it in this work, as it was compiled by our <lb/>
            predecessors, that the knowledge of so exalted a patron may <lb/>
            profit the reader, and my labour and regard be pleasing to <lb/>
            the Lord God, while I have endeavoured to publish the <lb/>
            glorious actions of my nursing father to the praise of Him <lb/>
            in whom we live, and move, and have our being. But, from <lb/>
            the time that this illustrious man was taken from the world, <lb/>
            who and what his successors were in the convent of Ouche <lb/>
            for four hundred years, or what were the fortunes of the <lb/>
            monks or the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, I am <lb/>
            entirely ignorant. In the times which succeeded, as I have <lb/>
            already distinctly stated on several occasions, bands of pirates <lb/>
            issued from Denmark, first with Hasting for their leader, and <lb/>
            afterwards Rollo, invaded Neustria, and ignorant of Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity and of the pure worship of God, inflicted the most <lb/>
            cruel disasters on the believing natives. They burnt Noyon <lb/>
            and Rouen, and many other cities, towns, and villages, <lb/>
            destroyed a number of monasteries of venerable sanctity, <lb/>
            devastated a vast extent of country with their incessant <lb/>
            ravages, and having either exterminated or driven out the <lb/>
            inhabitants, reduced the towns and villages to utter solitude. <lb/>
            In the midst of so much desolation, the defenceless monks, <lb/>
            not knowing what to do, were often in the greatest terror ; <pb n="297"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 841—876.]"/> <lb/>
            and in their tribulation gave vent to their distress in conti­ <lb/>
            nual lamentations, and waited their end in caverns and <lb/>
            thickets, absorbed in grief. Some indeed in terror at the <lb/>
            savage cruelty of the barbarians, fled to foreign lands which <lb/>
            had hitherto escaped the hostile attacks of the pagans. Some <lb/>
            also bore with them the remains of their fathers, whose souls <lb/>
            reign with the Lord of Sabaoth, whom they devoutly served <lb/>
            while on earth. The fugitives also carried abroad with them <lb/>
            the writings which contained the acts of these same fathers <lb/>
            in the Lord, and accounts of the possessions of the churches, <lb/>
            their nature and extent, and by whom they were given; but <lb/>
            great part of these documents was swept away in the <lb/>
            storms of the times, and alas! irrecoverably lost amidst such <lb/>
            fearful commotions.</p>
          <p>This is what the monks of Jumièges and Fontenelles did ;1 <lb/>
            overtaken by a terrible disaster they never brought back <lb/>
            what they carried away. The monks of Jumièges translated <lb/>
            to Haspres2 the relics of St. Hugh the archbishop and abbot <lb/>
            Aicadre, which the inhabitants of Cambray and Arras pre­ <lb/>
            serve in precious shrines, and venerate to this day. The <lb/>
            monks of Fontenelles carried to Ghent the relics of the holy <lb/>
            confessors Wandrille the abbot, and Ansbert and Wulfran, <lb/>
            archbishops,3 which are in the possession of the Flemings to <note type="footnote"> 1 Both these abbeys stood in the valley of the Seine, and were therefore <lb/>
            particularly exposed to the devastations of the Northmen. For some <lb/>
            account of Jumièges, see a note towards the close of the present chapter, <lb/>
            under date of the year 1050. The abbey of St. Wandrille, originally <lb/>
            Fontenelles, was founded in 648. Its ruins are now seen embosomed by <lb/>
            woods in a glen which issues on the road from Rouen to Havre, about <lb/>
            three miles from Caudebec. The refectory exhibits the only relics of the <lb/>
            Norman structure, and with some pointed arches of the church destroyed at <lb/>
            the revolution, is the principal remains of this once stately abbey. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Haspres, between Cambray and Valenciennes. It appears that Pepin <lb/>
            d'Herinstal, towards the end of the sixth century, founded a priory in this <lb/>

            St. Hugh, archbishop of Rouen, were translated there to secure them <lb/>
            from the outrages of the Northmen, but it must have been after their first <lb/>
            devastation of Jumièges, which took place the 24th of May, 841. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The relics of St. Wandrille and St. Ansbert, after several migrations <lb/>

            resting place on the 3rd of September of the latter year in the abbey of <lb/>
            St. Peter at Blankenberg, near Ghent. The account of the translation of <lb/>

            the present time, and are held by them in high veneration. <lb/>
            The monks of several other abbeys did the same thing, <lb/>
            whose names I omit partly from want of information (as I <lb/>
            have not discovered them all), and partly that I may avoid a <lb/>
            wearisome prolixity on matters of small importance.</p>
          <p>Dudo, dean of St. Quintin, wrote with care concerning <lb/>
            the arrival of the Normans and their barbarous cruelty, and <lb/>
            dedicated his work to Richard II., son of Gonnor, duke of <lb/>
            Normandy. William, surnamed Calculus, a monk of Jumi­ <lb/>
            èges made a skilful use of the materials furnished by Dudo <lb/>
            cleverly abridging them, and adding the history of Richard's <lb/>
            successors to the conquest of England, finished his narrative <lb/>
            with the battle of Senlac.1 He addressed his work to King <lb/>
            William, the greatest of his native princes. As others have <lb/>
            published magnificent accounts of sublime actions dedicated <lb/>
            to exalted personages, and have voluntarily offered them­ <lb/>
            selves to describe important events in fitting colours, I too, <lb/>
            moved by their example have undertaken a similar enter­ <lb/>
            prise, and have already written an account at some length, <lb/>
            of the monastery in the forest of Ouche which was honoura­ <lb/>
            bly restored in the time of William, who was first, duke of <lb/>
            Normandy, and afterwards king of England. However, I have <lb/>
            been able to find no written records of ancient times after the <lb/>
            decease of father Evroult, and I shall therefore more especially <lb/>
            endeavour to commit to writing the traditions I have col­ <lb/>
            lected from old persons respecting the translation of the re­ <lb/>
            mains of the holy confessor from his own abbey of Evroult. <lb/>
            A short account is to be found at Rebais, which I do not <lb/>
            altogether approve, and it seems to have been drawn up by <lb/>
            an ignorant writer, not fully informed with any certainty, as <lb/>
            it appears to me, of dates and circumstances. As therefore <lb/>
            I cannot rely on the narrative of another writer, I propose <note type="footnote"> their having also been carried to BlankEnberg, with the others already <lb/>
            mentioned. On the other hand, the monks of St. Wandrille (Fontenelles) <lb/>
            maintained that the body of St. Wulfran, discovered in their monastery in <lb/>
            1027, had never been removed from it; while the inhabitants of Abbeville <lb/>
            also claim the possession of these remains on respectable authority, as <lb/>

            to commit to writing a clear account of what I have myself <lb/>
            gathered from old inhabitants of Ouche respecting the time <lb/>
            and manner of the French obtaining possession of the pre­ <lb/>
            cious remains of the venerable Evroult.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 943, after Arnulph count of <lb/>
            Flanders had slain William Long-sword, duke of Normandy, <lb/>
            and Richard SOIl of Sprote, his son then aged only ten years, <lb/>
            had succeeded to the dukedom and received at Rouen before <lb/>
            his father's funeral the homage and fealty of all the barons, <lb/>
            Lewis D'Outre-Mer, king of France entered Normandy with <lb/>
            an army and succeeded by fraud in carrying off the young <lb/>
            duke to Laon, promising the Normans on oath that he <lb/>
            would bring him up as his own son, and have him fitly edu­ <lb/>
            cated in his royal court for governing the state. But things <lb/>
            turned out otherwise; for king Lewis, at the instigation of <lb/>
            the traitor Arnulph, resolved to put the boy to death, or at <lb/>
            least to deprive him of the power of bearing arms by ampu­ <lb/>
            tating some of his limbs. Osmund, the youth's tutor, learn­ <lb/>
            ing this from Ives de Creil,2 grand master of the royal <lb/>
            ordnance, he secretly persuaded Richard to feign sickness, <lb/>
            that he might thereby induce his guards to be less vigilant.</p>
          <p>One day, while the king was at supper, and every one was <lb/>
            engaged in his own concerns or those of others, Osmond <lb/>
            bought a truss of green forage, and ascending the castle rolled <lb/>
            it round the young duke. Then descending the tower he <lb/>
            made all haste to his quarters with the truss of grass and <lb/>
            spreading it before his horse, concealed the lad. When the <lb/>
            sun was set, he got out of the town, cautiously taking the <lb/>
            prince with him, and made for Couci where he gave him in <lb/>
            charge to Bernard, count de Senlis, his uncle.2</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Bernard the Dane, who was governor of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, sent envoys to Harold, king of Denmark, announcing <lb/>
            to him the death of Duke William, and that his son was <lb/>
            deprived of his inheritance. Harold, in consequence, sailed <lb/>
            to Normandy with a powerful fleet, and, being received in <lb/>
            the Cotentin by order of Bernard, waited two years for a <note type="footnote"> I Near Senlis. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Bernard, count de Senlis and Valois, son of Pepin II., a descendant <lb/>

            favourable opportunity of falling on the French, but at length <lb/>
            took a bloody revenge for the murder of his cousin William <lb/>
            and the banishment of that duke's son. For, hostilities <lb/>
            breaking out during a conference between the Danes and <lb/>
            French, he seized king Lewis, and put to the sword Herluin <lb/>
            and Lambert, with sixteen barons and numbers of inferior <lb/>
            rank.</p>
          <p>While however, Richard, the young duke, was detained <lb/>
            for nearly three years in exile, and the king of France <lb/>
            supposed that Normandy was entirely his own, he had some <lb/>
            apprehension of Hugh the Great, duke of Orleans, rendering <lb/>
            aid to the Normans, and he therefore ceded to him Runes, <lb/>
            Bayeux and all the district of the Cotentin as far as Mont St. <lb/>
            Michel-in-peril-of-the-sea, giving him strict orders to reduce <lb/>
            the rebellious Normans with a strong force, and get possession <lb/>
            of their fortified places. The ambitious marquis received <lb/>
            these commands with great satisfaction, and, at once break­ <lb/>
            ing the treaties which he had previously entered into, invaded <lb/>
            Normandy with a powerful army. Hugh himself established <lb/>
            himself with his household at Gacé, while his troops overspread <lb/>
            the whole province. Herluin, the duke's chancellor, and Ralph <lb/>
            de Tracy, were quartered at Ouche, and lodged in the con­ <lb/>
            vent of St Evroult the confessor. Both were men of piety <lb/>
            and lived in the fear of God. The simple monks rejoiced to <lb/>
            entertain such distinguished men, and rendered them all <lb/>
            hospitable attentions in their power with the utmost kind­ <lb/>
            ness. Conducting them without reserve through their <lb/>
            chapels, oratories, and secret recesses, they showed them, to <lb/>
            their loss, the shrines and relics of the saints which they <lb/>
            contained. The strangers examined with great reverence <lb/>
            these objects preserved with so much secrecy, and on their <lb/>
            departure offered their prayers and gifts; but they returned <lb/>
            shortly afterwards, like the Chaldeans to Jerusalem, and <lb/>
            cruelly carried off the holy vessels of the church, and all its <lb/>
            valuable treasures.</p>
          <p>Hugh the Great sat down before Exmes with his army, <lb/>
            but the garrison made a brave resistance and prevented his <lb/>
            further advance. At the same time, the king of France en­ <lb/>
            tering the country of Evreux with a strong force spread <lb/>
            fire and rapine through all Normandy. Bernard the Dane <pb n="301"/>
            <note type="margin"> 944.] </note> <lb/>
            being apprized of these incursions. and receiving sure ac­ <lb/>
            counts of the devastation of the country, was in great dismay <lb/>
            at his inability to withstand the attacks of such powerful <lb/>
            princes, with only his Norman levies. In consequence, <lb/>
            having keenly surveyed the state of affairs, his crafty genius <lb/>
            devised the means of extricating himself and the people he <lb/>
            governed from the difficulties in which they were placed. <lb/>
            He therefore met the king with the air of a suppliant and <lb/>
            thus addressed him: " What are you doing, my lord the king ? <lb/>
            Your undertaking is impious and unbefitting your rank. <lb/>
            All this Normandy, which you are ravaging, is your own. <lb/>
            Rouen and the other cities, with the villages and strong places, <lb/>
            throw open their gates at your command, and the whole <lb/>
            population, both rich and poor, submits to you, and having <lb/>
            no other lord respect and love you. Who can have given <lb/>
            you the disastrous counsel to ravage your own property with <lb/>
            the sword of the destroyer, and to butcher a people devoted <lb/>
            to you ? He must be a wicked traitor who has persuaded you <lb/>
            to devastate your own states with fire and sword." The <lb/>
            king's heart was softened by this specious language, so that <lb/>
            he dismissed his army and entered Rouen with Bernard. <lb/>
            Bernard gave him a brilliant reception, surrounded with <lb/>
            the citizens full of joy, and having prepared for him a mag­ <lb/>
            nificent banquet entertained him for several days with great <lb/>
            respect. However, as the king was sitting one day after <lb/>
            dinner in the great hall, conversing cheerfully with those <lb/>
            about him on affairs of state, the crafty Barnard addressed <lb/>
            them in ambiguous terms: " We have," he said, " O Norman <lb/>
            lords, great cause for joy, and let us render thanks to God for <lb/>
            it, as we ought. Hitherto we have obeyed a duke of the race <lb/>
            of Rollo; now, by God's will, we are the subjects of a great <lb/>
            king of the race of the emperor Charlemagne. To this time <lb/>
            we have been ducal, now we are royal, and, what is more, <lb/>
            imperial." All the company applauding this discourse, and <lb/>
            deceiving the French by flattering words, Bernard again <lb/>
            entreated silence, and thus proceeded while there was gene­ <lb/>
            ral attention : " I acknowledge the shrewdness of the French <lb/>
            in many affairs, but there is one thing my lord the king has <lb/>
            done which I cannot approve, for I perceive in it his own dis­ <lb/>
            advantage and great dishonour. We all know that Hugh <lb/>
            the Great is a traitor, and the son of a traitor; and yet the <pb n="302"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. CH.X. </note> <lb/>
            king has aggrandized him, as I think, to his own great injury, <lb/>
            by giving him the districts of Exmes and the Cotentin, with <lb/>
            many thousand men bearing arms. Some pestilent adviser <lb/>
            has taken advantage of his master's simplicity, and, to speak <lb/>
            the truth, has plunged a dagger into his heart by persuading <lb/>
            his lord to strengthen his enemy against himself. I wonder <lb/>
            much, my lord the king, that you have so entirely forgotten <lb/>
            the past. It is plain to all the world, for such crimes cannot <lb/>
            be committed in private, that Robert,1 Hugh's father, was a <lb/>
            traitor, and having rebelled against your father Charles, and <lb/>
            breaking his oath of allegiance usurped the crown and de­ <lb/>
            servedly fell in battle. Hugh was a party to these designs, <lb/>
            and disturbed France for seven years while you were an <lb/>
            exile with your uncle Athelstan in England.2 Is it not <lb/>
            clear as the light to any sensible person that he is guilty of <lb/>
            high treason who wickedly suggests to the king that strip­ <lb/>
            ping himself of his own estates, he should lessen his own <lb/>
            dominions to augment the strength of an enemy who will <lb/>
            turn it against yourself. Let no one have a share in <lb/>
            the duchy of Normandy, but the king of France be the <lb/>
            sole ruler of the Normans who pay him their willing obe­ <lb/>
            dience."</p>
          <p>On hearing this, the king became anxious about the gift <lb/>
            he had voluntarily made to Hugh, without any application <lb/>
            on his part, and asked to be advised what he should do in <lb/>
            the affair. The crafty Dane replied that the king ought <lb/>
            without hesitation to annul his engagements, and give a posi­ <lb/>
            tive command to Hugh to raise the siege of Exmes; and if <lb/>
            he should rebelliously resist the order, they should fall upon <lb/>
            him with their united forces. Bernard selected two knights <lb/>
            for this embassy, and the king dictated to them the impe­ <lb/>
            rious orders they were to carry to Hugh. Thereupon, the <lb/>
            envoys made all haste to the camp of Hugh, and reported <lb/>
            to him faithfully the king's message: " Your presumption," <lb/>
            they said, " is intolerable in invading the dominions of your <lb/>
            lord the king of France, and besieging the castle of Exmes, <note type="footnote"> 1 Robert, duke of France, second of the name, was son of Robert the <lb/>

            which has been a royal seat from ancient times.1 Hear now <lb/>
            his commands in this matter; and on the fealty you owe <lb/>
            him, obey them without delay. Raise the siege before sun­ <lb/>
            set, and give account of your rash enterprise to the king at <lb/>
            Laon, with the advice and judgment of his peers, when he <lb/>
            shall appoint a time. Otherwise, prepare yourself and your <lb/>
            people for battle, for the king your lord, if he finds you here, <lb/>
            will attack you with the forces of France and Normandy <lb/>
            before the week is passed."</p>
          <p>This message violently enraged Hugh the Great, and <lb/>
            rousing him to the highest pitch of resentment, he exclaimed <lb/>
            to his attendants: " This weak king must be demented to <lb/>
            send me such a message while I am supporting him with <lb/>
            all my power. I never coveted the possession of Normandy, <lb/>
            or demanded any part of it from him; but he made me the <lb/>
            voluntary offer of the whole country on this side of the <lb/>
            Seine, as far as the sea, and required my assistance to sub­ <lb/>
            due these indomitable pirates. Does he not manifest his folly <lb/>
            to all the world when he threatens to fight me at the very <lb/>
            time I am obeying his orders. The man who serves an <lb/>
            unjust master is much to be pitied, and he who submits to <lb/>
            one who is at once faithless and weak is a fool himself. Let <lb/>
            us make a hasty retreat; but see that you devastate the <lb/>
            whole country, ruin the churches, burn the houses, level - the <lb/>
            ovens and mills, drive off the flocks and herds of cattle, and <lb/>
            carry away with you, never to return, every sort of plunder, <lb/>
            and, loaded with booty, leave those miscreants to them­ <lb/>
            selves."</p>
          <p>Receiving such orders, the troops dispersed themselves <lb/>
            like bands of robbers throughout the province, and taking <lb/>
            the country-people by surprise, while they thought them­ <lb/>
            selves safe under the duke's protection, executed his orders <lb/>
            without mercy. Then Herluin, the chancellor, and Ralph <lb/>
            de Tracy did not trouble themselves about the cattle or the <lb/>
            goods of the peasantry, but recollecting their sojourn at <lb/>
            Ouche, returned thither, and unexpectedly entered the con­ <lb/>
            vent with their followers. While the monks who suspected <lb/>
            no evil, stood aghast, the armed band burst into the church <lb/>
            with violence, and penetrated into its secret recesses, and <note type="footnote"> 1 M. Le Prévost remarks that Exmes had never any pretensions to be <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.VI. cn.x. </note> <lb/>
            even broke open the tombs. Taking the bodies of the three <lb/>
            saints Evroult, Evremond,1 and Ansbert2 out of their coffins <lb/>
            and wrapping the bones in deer-skins, they carried them off <lb/>
            with the relics of other saints. The armed retainers pene­ <lb/>
            trated into every corner of the abbey and irreverently laid <lb/>
            hands on all that was serviceable to human existence, in <lb/>
            spite of the lamentations of the weeping monks. Setting <lb/>
            no bounds to their rapacity, and respecting no one, they <lb/>
            pillaged the books, vestments, and various articles of furni­ <lb/>
            ture belonging to the monks and their servants, and <lb/>
            ransacking every place which the brethren themselves had <lb/>
            opened to them on a former occasion, as already related, <lb/>
            they swept every thing away. They then joined the rest of <lb/>
            the invaders, and the whole, united in one body, marched out <lb/>
            of Normandy, and hastened back to their own country with <lb/>
            the booty they had collected. The monks of Ouche were <lb/>
            overwhelmed with grief at their sad desolation, and were at <lb/>
            a loss to determine what they should do or where they should <lb/>
            go now that they had been stripped of all. After consider­ <lb/>
            ing, however, all circumstances, they resolved to leave the <lb/>
            country, and follow the relics of their sainted founder.</p>
          <p>A venerable old man, whose name was Ascelin, filled at <lb/>
            that time the office of prior of Ouche, diligently performing <lb/>
            its functions according to the circumstances of the times. <lb/>
            Seeing the monks and their servitors plunged in excessive <lb/>
            grief, and all preparing to leave together their now desolate <lb/>
            abode and follow their blessed patron among hostile bands, <lb/>
            after much careful reflection he determined to wait the time <lb/>
            of his dissolution in that place in the fear of the Lord. He, <lb/>
            therefore, called the brethren together, and when they were all <lb/>
            assembled, thus spoke: " For our sins, and those of our fathers, <note type="footnote"> 1 St. Evremond was a native of Bayeux, as well as St. Evroult, and <lb/>
            their legends are very similar. St. Evremond quitted the world to retire <lb/>
            into a solitude in another part of the diocese of S6ez, Fontenay-Ies- <lb/>
            Louvets, after previously founding a monastery half a league from thence. <lb/>

            the scourge of God has fallen upon us, and its terrible stroke <lb/>
            has levelled us and ours, and brought us to irreparable ruin. <lb/>
            Behold the Judge Almighty, as he destroyed Jerusalem by <lb/>
            the hands of Nebuchodnosor and the Chaldees, justly <lb/>
            humbling his own sanctuary, so he has punished this house <lb/>
            by the hands of Hugh and the French with afflictions of <lb/>
            various kinds, but principally (which is most to be lamented) <lb/>
            by depriving us of the bones of the blessed father Evroult <lb/>
            and other saints. As for you who propose to follow the <lb/>
            relics of your founder, for various reasons, I do not venture <lb/>
            to prohibit your enterprise, as this whole neighbourhood is <lb/>
            now a desert, and defenceless monks would starve while <lb/>
            princes are in arms. Go, with God's blessing, and be faith­ <lb/>
            ful servants to the kind father who has hitherto sustained <lb/>
            you in his own country, becoming now pilgrims with him in <lb/>
            a strange land. For myself I shall not desert Ouche, but <lb/>
            shall still serve my Creator in this place where I have <lb/>
            enjoyed so many blessings, and never quit it while life <lb/>
            remains. I know that the bodies of many saints repose <lb/>
            here, and the spot was pointed out to our holy father by an <lb/>
            angelic vision, for the exercise of his spiritual warfare to the <lb/>
            profit of numbers. A great company of the faithful have <lb/>
            here offered to the King Most High the acceptable incense <lb/>
            of a devout life, of which they are now receiving the crown <lb/>
            and the rewards in paradise. Here, then, I shall remain <lb/>
            after your departure, and in imitation of our founder, <lb/>
            become the guardian of these solitudes in the name of the <lb/>
            Lord, until, through his mercy who is King of kings, better <lb/>
            times shall dawn upon us."</p>
          <p>At these words, the afflicted brethren parted. There­ <lb/>
            upon, the monks of St. Evroult and their attendants aban­ <lb/>
            doned their home, and joining their enemies, followed <lb/>
            weeping the relics of their patron. Their number, including <lb/>
            their domestics, was about thirty, and they all marched on foot <lb/>
            in company with the [duke's] chaplains. The latter knew <lb/>
            the monks well enough, but showed them no courtesy, as <lb/>
            they suspected and feared that their object was privately to <lb/>
            rob the French of their precious treasure. But the merciful <lb/>
            Lord, who chastises the erring to bring them back to the <lb/>
            right way, treats those who are converted with fatherly <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="306"/>

            kindness, and gives his aid in a wonderful manner to those <lb/>
            who need it.</p>
          <p>The troop encamped the first night after leaving Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy at a place called Champs,1 and after supper some of <lb/>
            the duke's boon companions fell into bantering and unseemly <lb/>
            talk. One of these jesters said jocosely to the duke: " Have <lb/>
            you heard, my lord duke, what your chancellor Herluin and <lb/>
            your chamberlain Ralph have done ? They have dug up the <lb/>
            bodies of some Norman peasants, and deluding themselves <lb/>
            with the notion that they are holy relics, they have deposited <lb/>
            them in your chapel, and are reverently conveying them <lb/>
            into France." The duke asking the names of those whose <lb/>
            bodies they were carrying, the jester said: " Evroult, <lb/>
            Evremond, and Ansbert;" whereat the French, to whom <lb/>
            these names were not familiar, and who were ignorant of the <lb/>
            glory to which the blessed saints were exalted in heaven, <lb/>
            indulged in much idle banter about the relics. But in the <lb/>
            first night-watch, when all were asleep, the Almighty thun­ <lb/>
            dered awfully out of heaven, and shooting forth his lightning <lb/>
            in bright flashes, struck the buffoon and his companions who <lb/>
            had made light of the holy relics. Their sudden death <lb/>
            caused no small alarm to the duke and his whole army; <lb/>
            whereupon he assembled the troops very early in the morning, <lb/>
            and commanding the chancellor to bring the relics reverently <lb/>
            into his presence, he made every one offer their devotions <lb/>
            to them before they began their march. He also summoned <lb/>
            before him the weeping monks and their attendants, and <lb/>
            requiring from them some account of Evroult and his com­ <lb/>
            panions, listened with pleasure to the history they gave of <lb/>
            the venerable men, and called on the Belgian nobles3 to hear <lb/>
            the marvels. He was also touched by the worth and sim­ <lb/>
            plicity of the monks of Ouche, and being moved to compas­ <lb/>
            sion towards them by the inspiration of God, who shows <lb/>
            mercy to his faithful servants on all occasions, he said to <lb/>
            them: " I esteem above gold and silver the relics of your <lb/>

            to permit you to receive all the offerings made to the holy <lb/>
            relics, until you shall reach Orleans, the capital of my <lb/>
            duchy,1 when I will provide for your sufficient main­ <lb/>

          <p>The prospects of the monks of Ouche in a strange <lb/>
            country now began to brighten, and they daily received <lb/>
            large offerings from the faithful, and, through God's mercy, <lb/>
            were comforted by the abundant gifts which flowed from the <lb/>
            necessities of the sick or the benevolence of the devout. <lb/>
            When they arrived at Orleans, the troops of soldiers with <lb/>
            their squires and horses, filled all the houses and buildings <lb/>
            in the city, so that the monks with the holy relics took <lb/>
            refuge in a bakehouse, where they rested the first night. <lb/>
            The citizens afterwards built a church on the spot, dedicated <lb/>
            to St. Evroult, and through the merits of the saints many <lb/>
            miracles of healing were performed there. Herluin the <lb/>
            chancellor was abbot of St. Peter-en-Point, where he depo­ <lb/>
            sited the holy relics by command of Hugh the Great.2 Then <lb/>
            Ralph de Tracy claimed his part of the spoil, and would not <lb/>
            relinquish it at any price. He was an eminent citizen of <lb/>
            Soissons and the duke's first chamberlain, possessed large <lb/>
            domains, honours, and wealth, and was distinguished by his <lb/>
            piety and other virtues. No one dared to wrong so powerful <lb/>
            a lord, and by a general order the relics were brought into <lb/>
            court and divided in the presence of the judges. Herluin <lb/>
            being a priest, and abbot of the canons of St. Peter, as well <lb/>
            as first chaplain to the duke, retained for his share the head <lb/>
            and the greatest part of the bones of St. Evroult, also a book <lb/>
            and a portable altar plated with silver, the gown and <lb/>
            girdle of St. Evroult, and the charters of donation; the rest <lb/>
            of the body he yielded to Ralph. There was no difficulty <lb/>
            about the division of the other relics, for the Orleannois <lb/>
            chose the bones of St. Evremond the abbot for their share, <note type="footnote"> 1 Orleans was not Hugh's capital as duke of France, but as count of <lb/>

            and left those of St. Ansbert, the monk, to Ralph. He <lb/>
            hastened with this precious treasure to Rebais,1 and devoutly <lb/>
            offered it to that abbey of which he was a brother and <lb/>
            friend. The monks of Rebais, in white and silken vestments, <lb/>
            came forth in procession with lighted tapers and censers <lb/>
            fuming with incense to receive the relics in great triumph, <lb/>
            and they preserve them with reverence to this day. Then <lb/>
            Ralph, wishing to augment the property of the church out of <lb/>
            his own domains, gave them Port d'Aunois and Bonneil,2 <lb/>
            and that there might be abundant means for supplying <lb/>
            shrines for the relics he added large sums of gold and silver. <lb/>
            In return for these offerings, this lord at his death was <lb/>
            buried in the church.</p>
          <p>In such changes foreign worshippers are sometimes de­ <lb/>
            ceived, but as their object is good, they easily obtain pardon <lb/>
            for unintentional error. They venerate, indeed, the relics <lb/>
            which chance gave them, to the utmost of their power; <lb/>
            being mistaken, however, in their notions respecting Ans­ <lb/>
            bert, a stranger to them, and exalting him beyond his due <lb/>
            by making him to have been archbishop of Rouen. But I <lb/>
            boldly assert what I have learnt from careful inquiries, that <lb/>
            this Ansbert was the young monk who, having died sud­ <lb/>
            denly without the viaticum, was soon afterwards restored to <lb/>
            life by St. Evroult, and having received the communion <lb/>
            departed in the Lord, and was admitted to partake in the <lb/>
            feast of the saints. As for Ansbert of Rouen, his remains <lb/>
            are preserved at Fontenelles with those of abbot Wandrille <lb/>
            and Wulfran, archbishop of Sens, and are daily honoured by <lb/>
            the devotions of the faithful.3 Thus I have given a faithful <lb/>
            account of the division of the relics of St. Evroult, as I <lb/>
            received it myself long ago from truthful and religious old <lb/>
            persons.</p>

            ances breaking out between Charles and the nobles of the <lb/>
            realm, Hugh usurped the crown, which has descended to his <lb/>
            heirs to the present day. Geoffrey,2 son of the count of <lb/>
            Anjou, was this Hugh's godson, and having been brought <lb/>
            up by him until he arrived at man's estate, received at his <lb/>
            hands the honour of knighthood. Having learnt with sor­ <lb/>
            row at court that his father was dead, he demanded of the <lb/>
            king to be invested in his hereditary domains, at the same <lb/>
            time earnestly beseeching him to give him some part of the <lb/>
            bones of St. Evroult, whose miracles he had often witnessed <lb/>
            while residing at Orleans. Hugh had a great regard for the <lb/>
            young man, and he therefore granted him his father's <lb/>
            estates, and gave him some of the relics of St. Evroult. It <lb/>
            was therefore through him that the relics of St. Evroult <lb/>
            were obtained, which still receive the veneration of the <lb/>
            faithful in the church of St. Main-beuf at Angers.3 The <lb/>
            monks of Ouche, who expatriated themselves with the holy <lb/>
            body found, by God's providence, a welcome home among <lb/>
            their foreign hosts, and receiving abundance of bread and <lb/>
            wine, and also of fish, which the Loire supplies, ended their <lb/>
            days in France, after experiencing the many changes of <lb/>
            unstable fortune.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the aged Ascelin remained in the wilderness <lb/>
            at Ouche with a few poor inhabitants, bringing up his <lb/>
            nephew Ascelin, with Guisbert de Gacé and Harmond de <lb/>
            la Tillaie, and some other youths whom he taught reading,4 <lb/>

            a festival, which at the appointed time he celebrated to the <lb/>
            best of his power, and after a solemn mass delivered this <lb/>
            discourse to the people who were present:—“ We ought to <lb/>
            fear the divine threatenings, but our hearts are so hardened <lb/>
            that we take no account of the warnings addressed to us, <lb/>
            until, like the wicked servant, we feel the rod with which <lb/>
            we are scourged, and its sharp strokes cause us to wail and <lb/>
            lament. When formerly the Danes, who were then pagans, <lb/>
            ravaged Neustria under Hasting, and returned with new <lb/>
            fury under the command of Rollo, they ruined numberless <lb/>
            churches and monasteries, cities, and fortified places, but we, <lb/>
            living in a wild and barren country, escaped, under God's <lb/>
            protection, the swords of the invaders, although we were <lb/>
            subject to great alarm and severe penury.' Now, alas ! the <lb/>
            day of the Lord's wrath is come unexpectedly upon us, and <lb/>
            we have been robbed of the sacred relics which we valued <lb/>
            above all precious things by those we trusted on the score <lb/>
            of the hospitality we had shown them. We read in the holy <lb/>
            Scriptures that God forsook the tabernacle in Silo and de­ <lb/>
            livered his tent that he had pitched among men to the <lb/>
            uncircumcised, that is the falsely accusing, Philistines.2 A <lb/>
            like judgment has now fallen upon us; we have lost the <lb/>
            bodies of the saints, in which we placed our main dependence, <lb/>
            and our brethren having followed the coffins of our fathers <lb/>
            into a foreign country, we are left alone, few and weak in <lb/>
            this wild solitude. But although the French have trans­ <lb/>
            lated the sacred bones, and carried off our books, vestments, <lb/>
            and other precious articles, they have still left us the tombs <lb/>
            and the most sacred ashes of the saints' bodies, through <lb/>
            God's mercy, to our great consolation, with other holy <lb/>
            things which they could not remove. It is our duty to use <lb/>
            diligence, in carefully concealing and preserving with re­ <lb/>

            wards, but the exact spot where the relics were deposited I <lb/>
            was unable to discover, because, as I have already said, my <lb/>
            informants were excluded at the time of their concealment.</p>
          <p>These events happened in the time of Duke Richard I., <lb/>
            who governed Normandy fifty-two years, and, as it has been <lb/>
            before related, was at first driven into exile and endured <lb/>
            many tribulations, but afterwards, by God's help, subdued <lb/>
            his enemies and became powerful. In the midst of furious <lb/>
            storms, the good old Ascelin continued to live under the <lb/>
            monastic rule until he was bowed down with age, and at his <lb/>
            death committed the guardianship of Ouche to his nephew <note type="footnote"> 1 It is very difficult to reconcile this statement with the dates furnished <lb/>
            by our author. He says, just afterwards, that the circumstances took place <lb/>
            in the time of Duke Richard I., who died in 995, and Asceline may have <lb/>
            lived till about the same period, and probably did not conceal the relics till <lb/>
            his end was approaching. But supposing the choristers to have been ten <lb/>
            years old at that time, they would have been one hundred in 1085, when <lb/>
            Ordericus, at the age of eleven, was admitted a novice, at St. Evroult. The <lb/>
            account has an air of great probability, but a link in the chain of traditions <lb/>
            appears to be wanting. </note> <pb n="312"/>

            Ascelin, who was a clerk. This young man, in the ardour <lb/>
            of youth, became disgusted with his rude and solitary life, <lb/>
            and longed after the enjoyments of a town; and betaking <lb/>
            himself to France for the purpose of gaining instruction, he <lb/>
            was so captivated by all sorts of pleasures, that he lived <lb/>
            there almost fifty years, rising by the regular steps to the <lb/>
            rank of priest. Enslaved by carnal delights, and inflated by <lb/>
            growing prosperity during his residence in France, he lost <lb/>
            all recollection during his long life, even to old age, of what <lb/>
            his predecessors had entrusted to him in Normandy.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, by the death and departure of its inhabitants, <lb/>
            Ouche returned to its original solitude, and all vestiges of <lb/>
            human life having disappeared, the oratories and houses be­ <lb/>
            came overgrown with thick wood, and for a long period were <lb/>
            the resort of wild animals. Then it was said in a vision to <lb/>
            a certain priest named Restold, who lived in the province of <lb/>
            the Beauvaisis; " Go to St. Evroult in Normandy, and you <lb/>
            will enjoy there length of days, and a life full of joy and <lb/>
            pleasure." The priest therefore left his native country, and <lb/>
            journeying through Normandy searched for the house of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, but although he continued his inquiries for many <lb/>
            days, he could find no one to point it out. At last he found <lb/>
            the old church of St. Evroult at Montfort,1 and sojourned <lb/>
            there for some time, in the belief that it was the spot <lb/>
            assigned by his heavenly oracle to him and his posterity.</p>
          <p>A peasant of the name of Fala, in the territory of <lb/>
            Bauquencé, had a bull which, frequently separating from <lb/>
            the herd, ran into the forest, and though the owner sought <lb/>
            for it a long time with his servants and dogs, he never could <lb/>
            find it, but at the end of five or seven days, when it was <lb/>
            supposed to be irrecoverably lost, it made its appearance in <lb/>
            good condition. This happened so repeatedly that it be­ <lb/>
            came a customary thing. It became a joke among the <lb/>
            neighbours who observed it, and the bull had free leave to <lb/>
            go and come when he pleased. After a time, however, the <lb/>
            curiosity of the herdsmen was roused, and attempts were <lb/>
            made to trace the bull's wanderings in the forest, and it was <lb/>
            followed through the thickest brakes. Fala obtained the <lb/>
            assistance of an experienced hunter, whose name was Dui­ <lb/>
            lett, and he tracked the bull with the sagacity of a hound, <note type="footnote"> ' Near Gac6. </note> <pb n="313"/>
            <note type="margin"> ABOUT 1030.] </note> <lb/>
            until it was discovered lying before the altar of St. Peter <lb/>
            the apostle as if it were at prayers. The walls of the <lb/>
            church were shattered and held together by roots of ivy, <lb/>
            and the ruins of ancient buildings could be traced by the <lb/>
            observers. A dense wood had sprung up both within and <lb/>
            without, no one having lived there for fifty years. Upon <lb/>
            this discovery grey-headed old men recollected, that accord­ <lb/>
            ing to what their fathers had told them, St. Evroult and <lb/>
            many others, who held the world in contempt, had dwelt <lb/>
            there.</p>
          <p>Restold also had a new vision, which rebuked him for not <lb/>
            having justly obeyed the former command; and upon the <lb/>
            priest's anxiously inquiring by what means he could bet­ <lb/>
            ter fulfil the injunctions laid on him, he was told to go <lb/>
            to Ouche, and there serve God as the follower of St. <lb/>
            Evroult. Restold therefore left his first habitation at Mont­ <lb/>
            fort, and going to Ouche with his wife and his son Ilbert, <lb/>
            was the first who now took up his abode there.</p>
          <p>There was at that time a noble knight, named Gaston de <lb/>
            Montfort, who, inspired by the fear of the Lord, formed the <lb/>
            design of restoring all the churches in his neighbourhood <lb/>
            which had fallen to decay from age and neglect during the <lb/>
            many troubles I have before mentioned; and to this good <lb/>
            work he devoted his whole attention, and consecrated all the <lb/>
            means in his power. In consequence, he repaired the old <lb/>
            church of St. Peter at his own expense, endeavouring to <lb/>
            propitiate Almighty God by this undertaking. One morn­ <lb/>
            ing, as his herdsman was keeping his oxen on a hill, washed <lb/>
            at its base by the rivulet of Charenton,1 and was resting <lb/>
            among the ruins where the herbage was most luxuriant, all <lb/>
            of a sudden, one in the guise of a pilgrim stood before him, <lb/>
            and appearing wearied by his journey, sat down and began <lb/>
            to converse with him: " Go," said he, " quickly to Gaston, <lb/>
            and tell him to come to me without delay." The herdsman <note type="footnote"> 1 The Charenton is only a rivulet in this part of its course, but has <lb/>
            worked for itself a deep channel in the soft bed of the valley. After its <lb/>
            confluence with the Risle, their united waters discharge themselves into the <lb/>
            estuary of the Seine, between Honfleur and Quillebœuf. The Orne, also, <lb/>
            and the Dive, the Touques and the Iton, all take their rise in the elevated <lb/>
            forest district about St. Evroult which is the water-shed between the rivers <lb/>
            which discharge themselves into the Manche, and the Sarthe, the Huine, <lb/>
            and other rivers and streams flowing into the Loire. </note> <pb n="314"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.VI. CH.X. </note> <lb/>
            hastened to his master and gave him the pilgrim's message, <lb/>
            but Gaston was idly disposed and would not obey the sum­ <lb/>
            mons, but desired the pilgrim, through his servant, to come <lb/>
            to him. The pilgrim repeated his message to Gaston a <lb/>
            second and a third time, but being occupied by I know not <lb/>
            what affairs, he obstinately refused to come. When there­ <lb/>
            fore the herdsman returned the third time and told this to <lb/>
            the pilgrim, the old man said, " Come with me and mark <lb/>
            carefully what I say: this place was sanctified in ancient <lb/>
            times by the divine benediction, and is rich in most sacred <lb/>
            relics.” Thus saying, the hoary speaker rose and pointed <lb/>
            out, in the middle of the area, the site of the altar of the <lb/>
            holy Mary, mother of God,1 and to the east that of the <lb/>
            holy and undivided Trinity. He then said further to the <lb/>
            astonished herdsman: " If your master had come to me as I <lb/>
            required him by you, I would have discovered to him hidden <lb/>
            treasures, by means of which he might have repaired this <lb/>
            old church, and I would have made known to him another <lb/>
            secret, which would have caused great joy throughout all <lb/>
            Normandy. Upon hearing these last words, the servant <lb/>
            retraced his steps and repeated them to Gaston, who im­ <lb/>
            mediately mounted his horse and came with all speed to the <lb/>
            place pointed out, but the pilgrim had disappeared. He <lb/>
            was now extremely sorry for the indifference he had mani­ <lb/>
            fested, and eagerly questioned the herdsman as to all he had <lb/>
            heard about the holiness of the place and the two altars. <lb/>
            He then had a conference with Ralph Fresnel,2 son of <lb/>
            Thorold, who was then lord of the soil, and with God's help <lb/>
            undertook the restoration of the church of St. Mary-always­ <lb/>
            a-virgin. The labourers cleared out the old ruins, in which <lb/>
            they found a prodigious quantity of stones, enabling them <lb/>
            to carry on the work with great dispatch. They found the <lb/>
            tombs of many noble persons, in which old men declare, <lb/>
            from certain marks they discovered, the bodies of kings and <lb/>
            bishops were laid. <note type="footnote"> I The church here spoken of is that built by Queen Faileube in honour <lb/>
            of the Virgin, and on the site of which Notre-Dame-du-Bois now <lb/>

          <p>Some miracles were also wrought there. A knight named <lb/>
            Harduin, having observed a large block of stone among the <lb/>
            ruins of the church, desired to appropriate it to his own use, <lb/>
            and caused it to be transported to his house and converted <lb/>
            into a cistern for himself and his cattle; but when they <lb/>
            began to hollow it out, he fell ill. During his illness, <lb/>
            Gunfold de Touquette,1 a knight of that country, had a <lb/>
            vision; instructed by which he visited Harduin, who was <lb/>
            lying sick, and admonished him to restore the block of stone <lb/>
            to its original site, otherwise he would inevitably die. On <lb/>
            hearing this, the sick man immediately called his servants, <lb/>
            ordered them to harness four yoke of oxen to a waggon, and <lb/>
            earnestly begged them to carry back the stone to the church <lb/>
            of the holy Virgin Mother. The block of stone being loaded <lb/>
            on the waggon, he caused himself to be lifted on it, and <lb/>
            thus conveying it back to the holy building from which he <lb/>
            had purloined it he confessed his sin, and invoking the <lb/>
            mercy of the Almighty Lord, was immediately cured.</p>
          <p>Many other miracles were wrought in this place which <lb/>
            have fallen into oblivion by the death of the neighbours <lb/>
            then living, not having been committed to writing, from the <lb/>
            great dearth of penmen at that time in Normandy.</p>
          <p>When, at last, the church was erected on a wooded hill, <lb/>
            all the inhabitants of the district were full of joy, and the <lb/>
            cure of it with the government of the parish was committed <lb/>
            to Restold of the Beauvaisis, as well by Gaston and Ralph, <lb/>
            as by the bishop of Evreux, in whose diocese it stood.</p>
          <p>At that time William, son of Giroie,2 was lord of Echau­ <lb/>
            four, and heard of the existence in the forest of the fountain <lb/>
            of St. Evroult and the old church of St. Peter the apostle on <lb/>
            the rivulet called Charenton. Led by curiosity, he surveyed <lb/>
            this spot, and, perceiving it to be a fitting place for the <lb/>
            worshippers of God, honoured it with respect, and settled <lb/>
            there the priests Restold and Ingeran, providing them a <lb/>
            sufficient maintenance out of the revenues of Echaufour. In <lb/>
            process of time, as is fully related in the third book of the <lb/>
            present work, the abbey of St. Evroult was restored by this <lb/>
            William Giroie and his brothers and nephews, and received <note type="footnote"> Touquette, a commune to the west of St. Evroult. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A full account of William Giroie is given in vol. i. p. 384, &amp;c. The <lb/>

          <p>In the year of our Lord 1051 Theodoric, a monk of <lb/>
            Jumièges, undertook the administration of the abbey, edu­ <lb/>
            eating the young flock with piety and prudence for eight <lb/>
            years,1 and instructing them to work worthily in the law of <lb/>
            the Lord according to the rule of St. Benedict. Afterwards, <lb/>
            as I have already related, he shrank from the burden of the <lb/>
            government, and resigning it, to the great grief of the pre­ <lb/>
            lates Mauritius of Rouen, and Hugh of Lisieux, he became <lb/>
            a pilgrim in foreign lands, treading under foot worldly <lb/>
            things, and, longing for the heavenly Jerusalem, laboured to <lb/>
            reach the terrestrial. But he died in the island of Cyprus, <lb/>
            in the church of St. Nicholas, before the altar, on the calends <lb/>
            [1st] of August, and was interred with respect by the con­ <lb/>
            vent of monks ,in that place, which he made illustrious by <lb/>
            frequent miracles in healing the sick. I composed the <lb/>
            following epitaph in heroic verse, to his memory;- <lb/>

            nistration. It lasted from October 3, 1050, to August 29, 1057. Jumièges, <lb/>
            founded by St. Philibert in 654, was one of the most magnificent of those <lb/>
            Benedictine abbeys which were celebrated for their learning in the dark <lb/>
            ages. A short notice of William Calculus, one of the monks who wrote <lb/>
            the histories of the dukes of Normandy, and who died in 1090, is given in <lb/>
            a note, p. 376, of vol. i. The situation of the abbey on a peninsula round <lb/>
            which the Seine makes a bold sweep, almost encircling it with its <lb/>
            stream and high wooded banks, was well calculated for a studious and con­ <lb/>
            templative life. The remains are among the most considerable and the best <lb/>
            preserved of the monastic buildings of Normandy. The west front of the <lb/>
            abbey church is still surmounted by two lofty octagonal towers, but one <lb/>
            side only of the great central tower is standing. The nave, with its <lb/>
            massive pillars and columns supporting circular Norman arches, remains <lb/>
            entire. These parts of the building are of the date 1067. The choir has <lb/>
            been razed to the ground, except part of the apsis, and some arches exhi­ <lb/>
            biting the pointed style of the thirteenth century. The -site is strewed <lb/>
            with interesting fragments of the building and monumental slabs and <lb/>
            effigies, which are carefully preserved though the ruins have repeatedly <lb/>
            changed owners. Many portions of the conventual buildings may still be <lb/>
            traced. The gate-house has been converted into a residence, and a lofty <lb/>
            wall surrounds the large enclosure formerly the convent gardens, and now <lb/>
            a well planted park, over the trees and shrubberies of which the grey ruins <lb/>

          <p>The monks of St. Evroult, profoundly grieved at not pos­ <lb/>

            to obtain its restoration, but hitherto without success. <lb/>
            Having been unable to fulfil their wishes in this respect, <lb/>
            they have procured several relics by various ways, and, by <lb/>

          <p>Fulk, prior of St. Evroult, who was afterwards abbot of <lb/>
            Dive, was sent by William the Bastard, king of England, to <lb/>
            the countess Bertha, at Brie, on particular business. While <lb/>
            there he obtained from a chaplain of the countess, a Norman <lb/>
            who belonged to the church of Rebais, a tooth of St. Evroult, <lb/>
            which on his return he restored to the abbey at Ouche to <lb/>
            the joy of all.</p>
          <p>During the reign of King Lewis,' there was a canon at <lb/>
            Paris named Fulbert, who possessed one of the vertebral <lb/>

            father's aid ; for without being aware of it he partook of <lb/>
            poison in his food, which the exercise of riding diffused <lb/>
            through his limbs and entrails. Finding that death was ap­ <lb/>
            proaching his vitals, he cried to God in great anguish of <lb/>
            mind praying that, for the merits of St. Evroult, he would <lb/>
            have mercy on him. His prayers and invocations being <lb/>
            ended, he vomited the poison, and was soon cured ; so that, <lb/>
            having returned thanks to God, he arrived safely at St. <lb/>
            Evroult, where he deposited the relic with great joy, en­ <lb/>
            closing it decently in a silver shrine.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 1130, Warm seventh abbot, of <lb/>
            St. Evroult, paid a visit to Rebais, where he understood one <lb/>
            half of the saint's body was deposited. He was attended by <lb/>
            two monks, Odo of Montreuil, and Warin of Séez, in this <lb/>
            search after their holy father's remains, in which they met <lb/>
            with considerable difficulties. Natalis, the abbot of Rebais,1 <lb/>
            was absent at that time, and it was the pleasure of the con­ <lb/>
            vent to receive them not with hospitality, but with hostility. <lb/>
            They found the neighbours equally averse to them, and they <lb/>
            were warned to depart with threatening language. How­ <lb/>
            ever, their good resolution was only strengthened, and <lb/>
            pushed them forward to the object they had in view. <lb/>
            Abbot Warin therefore, leaving his two companions at <lb/>
            Rebais, and laying aside his state as abbot, undertook a toil­ <lb/>
            some journey, and riding as a poor monk, was not ashamed <lb/>
            of being met on the road. Determined to find Abbot Na­ <lb/>
            tails, he went first to the court of Count Theobald at Rugni ;2 <lb/>
            and on the second day he was introduced to the abbot, but <lb/>
            did not tell him who he was or what he wanted. Natalis <lb/>
            told him that it was his intention to go to Clairvaux, and <lb/>
            offered to conduct him there. In consequence, they went in <lb/>
            company to Clairvaux, with their attendants, and were <lb/>
            kindly received by the brethren of that monastery, who en­ <lb/>
            deavour to practise the rule of St. Benedict to a letter. <lb/>
            They presented themselves to the Lord Bernard,3 abbot of <note type="footnote"> 1 Natalis, abbot of Rebais in 1133, was chance-or of France in 1140. <lb/>

            that monastery, and, conversing with him, made many <lb/>
            inquiries, and were struck with his profound wisdom. lie <lb/>
            commented with clearness on the sacred scriptures, satisfy­ <lb/>
            ing all their questions and demands. On hearing the claims <lb/>
            of the monks of St. Evroult, he kindly supported Abbot <lb/>
            Warin, and gave letters of exhortation to the convent at <lb/>
            Rebais. The abbots Warin and Natalis now returning <lb/>
            thither, found the monks Odo and Warin in good spirits <lb/>
            and on most friendly terms with the monks of Rebais ; for <lb/>
            they were both of mature age, courteous and modest and <lb/>
            well founded in both sacred and profound learning. But <lb/>
            though they were equally distinguished for their eloquence <lb/>
            and erudition, Odo, in his loving zeal, did all in his power to <lb/>
            have Warin preferred to himself. Indeed, Warin had much <lb/>
            grace and wisdom in discoursing on religion, and during the <lb/>
            eight days they staid there he gave, at the request of <lb/>
            Amaury the prior, exhortations to all who were in the <lb/>
            cloister; so that he obtained the good opinion of the whole <lb/>
            convent, and was no longer regarded as an enemy, but as a <lb/>
            faithful friend. Abbot Warin delivered the letter of the <lb/>
            venerable Abbot Bernard, which was well received by the <lb/>
            chapter of Rebais, and when it was read they determined to <lb/>
            comply with the request. By God's will, Stephen1 bishop of <lb/>
            Paris, and Burchard2 bishop of Meaux, were present, and <lb/>
            earnestly exhorted the monks of Rebais that they should <lb/>
            comfort those of St. Evroult with a sweet charity. A day <lb/>
            was therefore appointed by the bishops when, by common <lb/>
            consent, the relics of the saints reserved there should be <lb/>
            exhibited together, and the people of the neighbourhood be <lb/>
            assembled to see them and made joyful with a multiplied <lb/>
            benediction; whereupon the monks of St. Evroult should <lb/>
            receive what they desired and return home.</p>
          <p>But now Abbot Natalis changed his mind, and gave un­ <lb/>

            sistency; for he said, that without Count Theobald's consent <lb/>
            lie would never part with what he had given to the convent. <lb/>
            It was, therefore, agreed that Odo of St. Evroult should <lb/>
            proceed to Normandy and see the count, who had gone <lb/>
            there to confer with his uncle, King Henry. The monk, <lb/>
            obedient to his orders, undertook this toilsome journey, and <lb/>
            following the count, arrived at Vernon,1 where, in the first <lb/>
            instance, he made known his secret object to the king him­ <lb/>
            self, begging him to further it. The king promised his <lb/>
            assistance, and interfered with his nephew on behalf of the <lb/>
            monks. The count acceded to his uncle's request, and <lb/>
            transmitted his consent to the monks of Rebais by his <lb/>
            steward Andrew, who, however, did not appear on the day <lb/>
            when the relics were exhibited, but remained at Coulom­ <lb/>
            miers, the duke's castle. In consequence, the abbot of St. <lb/>
            Evroult, with Warin of Séez, and Andrew of Coulommiers,2 <lb/>
            proceeded to the steward, who received them graciously, and <lb/>
            commending himself to their prayers, informed them of the <lb/>
            count's consent, and declared himself his master's envoy and <lb/>
            commissioner in the affair. Abbot Warin and his compa­ <lb/>
            nions now returned to Rebais with great joy, and Abbot <lb/>
            Natalis, that hearing the count's licence was obtained, and <lb/>
            repenting of the vexation he had caused the monks of <lb/>
            St. Evroult, granted their petition. IThe prior, Amaury, <lb/>
            therefore, assembled the chapter the following morning, and <lb/>
            led the way to the church with the monks of St. Evroult; <lb/>
            the whole assemblage forming a procession to the sacristy. <lb/>
            The silver coffer, which contained the memorials of St. <lb/>
            Evroult3 was then opened, and the relics reverently taken <lb/>
            out, consisting of the right arm, and a casket full of frag­ <lb/>
            ments of bones. The monks of St. Evronlt now returned to <lb/>
            Normandy, arriving at Ouche on the seventh of the calends <lb/>
            of June [May 26th]. They were met by a vast multitude <lb/>
            of both sexes to the number of four thousand, who assem­ <lb/>
            bled to partake of the blessings of their great patron, and <lb/>
            to obtain by their prayers his intercession with God. Those <lb/>

            the merits of the good father Evroult, of whom numbers <lb/>
            having their petitions granted, triumphantly confided in the <lb/>
            merits of the holy saint.</p>
          <p>There was a man named Geoffrey, a native of Brittany, <lb/>
            but living in the Corbonnais,1 who, as he related himself, was <lb/>
            in his youth addicted to rapine and theft, but after a time, <lb/>
            by God's grace, changed his course of life for the better. <lb/>
            He took a wife in lawful marriage whose name was Hilde­ <lb/>
            burge, and listening to her good advice, dismissed his fierce <lb/>
            and bloody followers, and laboured with his own hands for <lb/>
            the means of existence. He even gave alms of what he <lb/>
            procured by the sweat of his brow, distributing among the <lb/>
            poor, the clergy, hermits, and monks all the superfluity he <lb/>
            thus earned, beyond what was absolutely necessary for the <lb/>
            subsistence of himself and his family. He frequented the <lb/>
            society of the monks of St. Evroult, and becoming their <lb/>
            brother in Christ, maintained well the bond of fraternity. <lb/>
            He was always present in the abbey at the principal festivals <lb/>
            of the saints, and remembering the precepts of the law, did <lb/>
            not come empty handed.</p>
          <p>A singular occurrence happened two years before the <lb/>
            death of King Henry. On the night of the Nativity of <lb/>
            the Holy Innocents,2 a snow storm came on suddenly with <lb/>
            such violence that the like had not been seen in the memory <lb/>
            of any man living, or of those who were their teachers. All <lb/>
            entrance to the houses was blocked up, the surface of the <lb/>
            roads was covered, valleys were filled to the level of hills, <lb/>
            birds and animals were suffocated, and even men were buried <lb/>
            in the drifts, and numbers of the faithful were prevented <lb/>
            from attending the service in the churches on that day. <lb/>
            Geoffrey, however, got up while the storm was raging, and, <lb/>
            disregarding the depth of snow, loaded a pack-horse with <lb/>
            bread made of wheaten floury took his son with him and set <lb/>
            forth to attend the feast of the holy father, St. Evroult. <note type="footnote"> 1 Also called La Perche, lying to the south of Normandy, and the <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VI. CH.X. "/>But when he reached the water called the Risle,1 over which <lb/>
            there was no bridge, he found that it was not fordable as <lb/>
            the waters were in flood, and in great terror and dismay he <lb/>
            cried to the Lord of mercy, and implored his aid. He <lb/>
            immediately became sensible of the divine support in the <lb/>
            pious undertaking in which he was engaged, and found him­ <lb/>
            self carried over the river without any visible conductor. <lb/>
            But he stood there alone, discovering that his son and the <lb/>
            beast, with its burden, were still on the other side of the <lb/>
            stream. At last the son, whose faith and merits were <lb/>
            perhaps less than his father's, trembling, entered the water, <lb/>
            up to the middle, and dragged the horse with its load of <lb/>
            bread after him, getting safe through with some difficulty. <lb/>
            Although the loaves intended for God's servants were <lb/>
            plunged in the stream, they remained dry and uninjured, so <lb/>
            that they were in a fit state for the use of Christ's house­ <lb/>
            hold, being miraculously preserved in the midst of the waters. <lb/>
            Father and son then proceeded in company to their place of <lb/>
            destination, and triumphantly described the perils they had <lb/>
            escaped, both on the roads and in the waters, attributing <lb/>
            their safety to the merits of St. Evroult, for whose feast <lb/>
            they were bound. The crowds collected at this solemnity, <lb/>
            having heard their account, glorified the Lord God of <lb/>
            Sabaoth, who is for ever the Saviour of his people.</p>
          <p>At that time Warin was abbot of St. Evroult,2 and he <lb/>
            had a great regard for Geoffrey, and respected him much for <lb/>
            his fervent devotion to God. The abbot himself was zealous <lb/>
            in the performance of divine worship, and set an example <lb/>
            by his constant attendance. He highly esteemed religious <lb/>
            men, giving place to them with the greatest marks of <lb/>
            respect; and he also applied himself diligently to useful <lb/>
            studies. Deeply learned as he was, he readily divested him­ <lb/>
            self of his magisterial authority, and putting himself on a <lb/>
            level with his juniors, joined as one of themselves in the <lb/>
            pursuits suited to their age with an alacrity which afforded <note type="footnote"> 1 To reach St. Evroult from the south-east, this rivulet, not the <lb/>

            an excellent example to all who were under his government. <lb/>
            Geoffrey was of middle stature, tall and thin, so that not <lb/>
            being burdened with flesh, his activity was remarkable. In <lb/>
            his humility he heard with attention the words of instruc­ <lb/>
            tion and doctrine which fell from the lips of others, and <lb/>
            frequently made diligent inquiries from his equals and <lb/>
            inferiors on subjects with which he was very well acquainted, <lb/>
            listening to them with the deference of a disciple. He <lb/>
            handled the lessons of the divine law with overflowing elo­ <lb/>
            quence, and skilfully explained the most profound doctrines <lb/>
            by his lucid dissertations. Having assumed the profession of <lb/>
            a monk when he was a young man of the age of twenty-three <lb/>
            years, he was a soldier of the most high King forty-six years, <lb/>
            and gave to the world the fruits of his penetrating genius <lb/>
            and deep meditations in metrical poems, eloquent epistles, <lb/>
            and other works. I will extract from them, and insert, in <lb/>
            this book of mine, an account of one miracle which he learnt <lb/>
            when he was at Thorney Abbey in England with Abbot <lb/>
            Robert,' and committed to writing, at the request of the <lb/>
            bishop of Ely2 and the convent of monks. The following is <lb/>
            the text of the letter:3—</p>
          <p>" To all the faithful sons of holy church, and especially to <lb/>
            those who are subject to the rule of the excellent father <lb/>
            Benedict, Hervey, the humblest servant of the servants of <lb/>
            God and the unworthy minister of the church of Ely, send­ <lb/>
            eth greeting, and trusts that what is well begun may be <lb/>
            happily ended. It is our wish to publish for the praise and <lb/>
            honour of St. Benedict, the patron of monks, a circumstance <lb/>
            worthy to be recorded as most agreeable to those who hear <lb/>

            possessions of our church a certain free-tenant called Bric­ <lb/>
            stan, who lived at Chatteris.1 This man, according to the <lb/>
            testimony of his neighbours, never injured any one, and, <lb/>
            content with what he had, meddled not with what belonged <lb/>
            to others. Neither very rich nor very poor, he conducted his <lb/>
            affairs and brought up his family, in moderate independence, <lb/>
            according to the habits of laymen. He lent money to his <lb/>
            neighbours who wanted it, but not at usury, while, on account <lb/>
            of the dishonesty of some of his debtors, he required security. <lb/>
            Thus holding a middle course, he was considered not better <lb/>
            than other good men, nor worse than the ill-disposed. Being <lb/>
            thus at peace with all mankind, and believing that he had not <lb/>
            a single enemy, he was inspired by divine influence (as it <lb/>
            appeared in the sequel) to entertain the desire of submitting <lb/>
            himself to the rule of St. Benedict, and assuming the habit. <lb/>
            In short, he came to our convent dedicated to St. Peter the <lb/>
            apostle and St. Etheldrida,2 implored the favour of the <lb/>
            monks, and engaged to put himself and all he had under <lb/>
            their rule. But, alas! the evil spirit, through whose malice <lb/>
            Adam fell in paradise, will never cease from persecuting his <lb/>
            posterity to the last man who shall exist. God, however, <lb/>
            whose providence ordereth all things in mercy and goodness, <lb/>
            in his omnipotence bringeth good out of evil, and out of <lb/>
            good what is still better. When, therefore, the news was <lb/>
            spread abroad (for Bricstan, though his acquaintance was <lb/>

          <p>" We must make a short digression that you may under­ <lb/>
            stand what sort of man this was. His name was Robert <lb/>
            Malart (which signifies in Latin malum artificem) and <lb/>
            not without reason. He had little else to do but to <lb/>
            make mischief against all sorts of persons, monks, clerks, <lb/>
            soldiers, and country folk ; in short, men of all ranks, whether <note type="footnote"> possession of the duchy of Normandy, September 28, 1100. The circum­ <lb/>

            they lived piously, or the contrary. That I may not be <lb/>
            accused of calumny, this was his constant practice, wherever <lb/>
            he was able to vent his malice. He slandered every one <lb/>
            alike to the best of his ability, and exerted himself to the <lb/>
            utmost for the injury of others. Thus mischievous to one <lb/>
            and another, he may be counted among those of whom it is <lb/>
            said that' they rejoice to do evil and delight in the froward­ <lb/>
            ness of the wicked.'1 When he failed of truth for his <lb/>
            accusations he became a liar, inventing falsehoods by help <lb/>
            of the devil, the father of lies. It would be impossible for <lb/>
            any one, even if he had been his constant companion from <lb/>
            childhood, to recount, much more to commit to writing, all <lb/>
            the evil doings of this man, who was truly called Thousand- <lb/>
            craft ;2 let us, therefore, proceed with our story.</p>
          <p>“When Robert heard the news that Bricstan wished to <lb/>
            assume the habit of a monk, he lost no time, in accordance <lb/>
            with the teaching of his master the devil, who is always <lb/>
            lying and deceiving, in presenting himself at the convent. <lb/>
            Having a false account to give, he began with a falsehood, <lb/>
            saying: 'This Bricstan is a thief; he has fradulently appro­ <lb/>
            priated the king's money in secret, and wishes to become a <lb/>
            monk, not to save his soul, but to save himself from the <lb/>
            sentence and punishment which his crimes merit. In short, he <lb/>
            has found a hidden treasure, and has turned usurer with <lb/>
            sums clandestinely subtracted from what is the king's by <lb/>
            right. Being therefore guilty of the grave offences of theft <lb/>
            and usury, he is afraid to appear before the king or the judges. <lb/>
            In consequence, I have the royal authority to forbid your <lb/>
            receiving him into your convent.' Whereupon, having heard <lb/>
            the king's prohibition, and dreading his anger, we refused to <lb/>
            admit the man into our society. What shall I say more ? <lb/>
            He gave bail and was brought to trial. Ralph Basset was <lb/>
            judge,3 and all the principal men of the county were assem­ <lb/>

            Robert abbot of Thorney, and many clerks and monks. <lb/>
            Not to make the story long, the accused appeared with his <lb/>
            wife, the charges falsely made against him were recapitulated. <lb/>
            He pleaded not guilty, he could not confess what he had not <lb/>
            done; the other party charged him with falsehoods, and made <lb/>
            sport of him; he was indeed rather corpulent, and was short <lb/>
            in stature, but he had, so to speak, an honest countenance. <lb/>
            After having unjustly loaded him with reproaches, they pre­ <lb/>
            judged him, as in the case of Susannah, and sentenced him <lb/>
            and all his substance to be at the king's mercy. After this <lb/>
            judgment, being compelled to surrender all that he possessed, <lb/>
            he gave up what he had in hand, and owned where his effects <lb/>
            were, and who were his debtors. Being however pressed to <lb/>
            give up and discover more, he replied in the English tongue: <lb/>
            Wat min Laert Godel Mihtin that ic sege soth, which means <lb/>
            ' My Lord God Almighty knows that I speak the truth.' <lb/>
            He often repeated this, but said nothing else. Having <lb/>
            delivered up all that he had, the holy relics were brought <lb/>
            into court, but when he was called upon to swear, he said to <lb/>
            his wife: ' My sister, I adjure you by the love there is <lb/>
            between us, not to suffer me to commit perjury; for I have <lb/>
            more fear of perilling my soul than of suffering bodily <lb/>
            torments. If therefore there is any reservation which affects <lb/>
            your conscience, do not hesitate to make it known. Our <lb/>
            spiritual enemy covets more keenly the damnation of our <lb/>
            souls, than the torture of our bodies.' To this she replied: <lb/>
            Sir, besides what you have declared, I have only sixteen <lb/>
            pence and two rings weighing four drachms.' These being <lb/>
            exhibited, the woman added: 'Dearest husband, you may <lb/>
            now take the oath in safety, and I will afterwards confirm, <lb/>
            on the testimony of my conscience, the truth you have sworn <lb/>
            by the ordeal of carrying hot iron in my naked hand, in the <lb/>
            presence of all who desire to witness it, if you so command.' <lb/>
            In short, Bricstan was sworn, he was then bound and <lb/>
            carried in custody to London, where he was thrown into a <lb/>
            gloomy dungeon. There, heavily ironed with chains of unusual <lb/>
            weight, in a most cruel and outrageous manner, he suffered for <lb/>
            some time the horrors of cold and hunger. In this extremity <note type="footnote"> 1 Reginald, abbot of Ramsay (in Huntingdonshire), from 1114—May <lb/>

            of distress, he implored divine assistance according to the best <lb/>
            of his ability, inspired by his urgent necessity. But as he <lb/>
            felt that his own merits were but very small, or to speak the <lb/>
            truth, of no account whatever, having no confidence in them <lb/>
            he incessantly invoked, with sorrowful heart and such words <lb/>
            as he could command, St. Benedict, to whose rule, as we have <lb/>
            seen before, he had unfeignedly proposed to devote himself, <lb/>
            and the holy virgin St. Etheldrida in whose monastery he <lb/>
            intended to make his profession. In this dark dungeon, <lb/>
            loaded with chains, tortured with cold, and wasted with <lb/>
            hunger, he wore out five wretched months, and would rather, <lb/>
            in my opinion, have chosen to die at once than live thus <lb/>
            miserably. But still, seeing no hopes of human help, he <lb/>
            continued to call on SS. Benedict and Etheldrida with sighs <lb/>
            and groans and tears, and with heart and mouth. To pro­ <lb/>
            ceed ; one night when the bells in the city were ringing for <lb/>
            lauds, and Bricstan, in his dungeon, besides his other <lb/>
            sufferings, had received no food for three days, so that he was <lb/>
            quite exhausted and entirely despaired of his recovery, he <lb/>
            repeated the names of the saints with a sorrowful voice. <lb/>
            Then at last, the clement and merciful God, the never-failing <lb/>
            fountain of all goodness, who never despises those that are <lb/>
            in adversity, and chooses none for their wealth or power, <lb/>
            at last vouchsafed to show his loving-kindness to the <lb/>
            supplicant. It had been long indeed implored, but it was de­ <lb/>
            ferred, that the earnestness of his supplications might be more <lb/>
            intense and the mercy shown be more ardently loved. For <lb/>
            now St. Benedict and St. Etheldrida, with her sister Sexburga,1 <lb/>
            stood before the sorrowful prisoner. The light which pre­ <lb/>
            ceded their appearance was so extraordinary that he screened <lb/>
            his eyes with his hands; and when the saints were seen <lb/>
            surrounded by it, Etheldrida spoke first: £ Bricstan,' she said, <lb/>
            'why do you so often pour out your griefs before us. <lb/>
            What do you implore us, with such earnest prayers, to grant?' <lb/>
            But he, spent with fasting, and being now thrown into a <lb/>
            sort of trance by excessive joy and the supernatural visita­ <lb/>
            tion, could say nothing in reply. Then the holy virgin <note type="footnote">1 Sexburga, eldest sister of St. Etheldrida, was married to Ercombert, <lb/>
            king of Kent. She founded a monastery in the isle of Sheppy, and after­ <lb/>
            wards succeeded her sister as abbess of Ely. See Bede's Eccles. Hist. p. <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VI. CH.X."/> <lb/>
            said: ‘ I am Etheldrida, whom you have so often invoked, <lb/>
            and this is St. Benedict under whose rule you devoted <lb/>
            yourself to the service of God, and whose aid you have <lb/>
            continually implored. Do you wish to be set free ?' On <lb/>
            hearing this his spirit revived, and waking, as it were, from <lb/>
            a dream, he said: ' My lady, if life can by any means be <lb/>
            granted me, I should wish to escape from this horrible <lb/>
            dungeon, but I find myself so worn out by sufferings of every <lb/>
            description, that my bodily powers are exhausted and I have <lb/>
            no longer any hope of obtaining my liberty.' Then the holy <lb/>
            virgin turning to St. Benedict, said : ' Holy Benedict, why <lb/>
            do you hesitate to do what the Lord has commanded you.' <lb/>
            At this, the venerable Benedict laid his hand on the fetters, <lb/>
            and they fell in pieces, so that the prisoner's feet were <lb/>
            released without his being sensible of any act, the saint <lb/>
            appearing to have shattered his chains by his word alone. <lb/>
            Having detached them, he threw them indignantly against <lb/>
            the beam which supported the floor of the prison, making a <lb/>
            great opening, and waking the guards, who lay in the gallery, <lb/>
            in great alarm at the crash which took place. They supposed <lb/>
            that the prisoners had made their escape, and lighting <lb/>
            torches hastened to the dungeon, and finding the doors fast <lb/>
            closed, they opened them with the keys and went in. Upon <lb/>
            seeing the prisoner they had left in fetters freed from his <lb/>
            chains, their astonishment increased, and upon their demand­ <lb/>
            ing an account of the noise they had heard, and who had <lb/>
            caused it, and how his fetters were struck off, Bricstan said <lb/>
            nothing, but a fellow prisoner replied: ‘ Some persons, I <lb/>
            know not who, entered the prison with a great light, and <lb/>
            talked with this man my companion, but what they said or <lb/>
            did I know not; ask him who knows best.' Then the <lb/>
            guards turning to Bricstan, said: ' Tell us what you saw <lb/>
            and heard.' He replied: ' St. Benedict, with St. Etheldrida <lb/>
            and her sister Sexburga appeared to me and struck the <lb/>
            fetters off my feet: if you will not believe me, at least <lb/>
            believe your own eyes.' As they did not doubt the miracle <lb/>
            they saw, the gaolers sent in the morning to queen Matilda,1 <lb/>
            who happened to be in the city at the time, to tell her of it. <note type="footnote"> 1 Matilda, a princess cf great piety and excellence, daughter of <lb/>
            Malcolm, king of Scotland, and Margaret, sister of Edgar Atheling, was <lb/>

            The queen sent Ralph Basset to the prison, the same who <lb/>
            had before doomed Bricstan, who said that magical art <lb/>
            was now employed. Ralph entering the dungeon addressed <lb/>
            the prisoners derisively, as he had done on the former occa­ <lb/>
            sion : ‘ What has happened Bricstan ? Has God spoken to <lb/>
            you by his angels ? Has he visited you in your prison ? <lb/>
            Tell me what witchcraft you have been practising.' But <lb/>
            Bricstan made no more reply than if he had been dead.</p>
          <p>" Then Ralph Basset, perceiving that his fetters were <lb/>
            broken, and hearing from his fellow prisoners of the three <lb/>
            persons who entered the dungeon surrounded by light, the <lb/>
            words they had spoken, and the crash they had made, and <lb/>
            perceiving the hand of God in these events, began to weep <lb/>
            bitterly; and, turning to Bricstan, he said: ' My brother, I <lb/>
            am a servant of St. Benedict and the holy virgin Etheldrida; <lb/>
            for the love of them speak to me.' He replied: ‘ If you <lb/>
            are a servant of those saints, you are welcome. Be assured <lb/>
            that what you see and hear about me is the truth, and not <lb/>
            the effect of magic.' Ralph, then, taking charge of the <lb/>
            prisoner, conducted him with tears of joy into the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of the queen, where many nobles were present. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the report flew swifter than a bird throughout <lb/>
            London, and coming to the ears of almost all the citizens, <lb/>
            they raised shouts to heaven, and people of both sexes and <lb/>
            every age praised together the name of the Lord, and <lb/>
            flocked to the court where it was reported Bricstan was <lb/>
            taken; some shedding tears of joy, and others wondering at <lb/>
            what they saw and heard. The queen, rejoicing in so <lb/>
            great a miracle (for she was a good Christian), ordered the <lb/>
            bells to be rung in all the monasteries throughout the city, <lb/>
            and thanksgivings to be offered by the convents belonging <lb/>
            to every ecclesiastical order. Bricstan went to many of the <lb/>
            churches to return thanks to God in the fulness of his joy <lb/>
            for his liberation, great crowds preceding and following <lb/>
            him through the suburbs, and every one being anxious to <lb/>
            see him, as if he were some new man. When he reached <lb/>
            the church of St. Peter, called in English Westminster, <lb/>
            Gilbert,1 the abbot of that place, a man of great eminence <note type="footnote"> 1 Gilbert Crespin, abbot of Westminster, son of William Crespin, <lb/>
            governor of Neaufle, one of the greatest benefactors to the abbey of Bee. <lb/>
            Gilbert was one of the most able and voluminous writers of the age. It </note> <pb n="330"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. CH.X. </note> <lb/>
            in sacred and profane literature, came forth to meet him <lb/>
            outside the abbey in a procession formed of the whole body <lb/>
            of monks, with all the pomp of the church ; for he said: ‘ If <lb/>
            the relics of a dead man are to be received with ceremony <lb/>
            in a church, we have much more reason for giving an <lb/>
            honourable reception to living relics, namely such a man as <lb/>
            this: for as to the dead, we who are still in this mortal life <lb/>
            are uncertain where their spirits are, but for this man, we <lb/>
            cannot be ignorant that he .has been visited and delivered <lb/>
            by God before our eyes, because he has not acted unjustly.'</p>
          <p>" When thanksgivings had been offered to God, to the best <lb/>
            of their ability, according to what in their estimation was <lb/>
            due for Bricstan's deliverance, the queen sent him with great <lb/>
            honour to the abbey of St. Etheldrida in the isle of Ely. I <lb/>
            went myself, attended by the whole convent of monks, to <lb/>
            meet him, with candles and crosses, chanting To Deum <lb/>
            laudamus. Having conducted him into the church with <lb/>
            befitting ceremony, and offered thanksgivings to God, we <lb/>
            delivered to him, in honour of the blessed Benedict his <lb/>
            liberator, the monastic habit he had so long desired. We <lb/>
            also hung up in the church, in view of the people, the <lb/>
            fetters with which he was bound, that they might be a <lb/>
            memorial of this great miracle, to the honour of St. Bene­ <lb/>
            dict, who broke them, and of St. Etheldrida, who was his <lb/>
            colleague and assistant; and they long continued to be <lb/>
            suspended there to keep alive the remembrance of these <lb/>
            events.</p>
          <p>" I have been desirous of making known to the sons of holy <lb/>
            church these acts of the venerable father Benedict, not <lb/>
            because he had not performed greater wonders, but because <lb/>
            they are more recent, and such miracles appear in our days <lb/>
            to be infrequent in England. Nor, as regards our blessed <lb/>
            father Benedict, let any one be surprised that he wrought <lb/>
            great and inconceivable wonders; for, according to Pope <lb/>
            Gregory, he may be equalled to Moses for having brought <lb/>
            water out of the rock; to Elijah for receiving the ministry of <lb/>
            a raven ; to Elisha for raising iron from the bottom of a pit <lb/>
            and to Peter for having caused a disciple to walk on the water <note type="footnote"> Appears that he was still living in 1123. For his life and writings, see the <lb/>

            at his commando St. Benedict likewise, as is well known, <lb/>
            showed himself to be a prophet by predicting events to <lb/>
            come, and an apostle by the miracles he wrought; and to <lb/>
            sum up all in few words, he was full of the spirit of all the <lb/>
            just. Since, therefore, we know with certainty that he <lb/>
            obtains from the Lord all that he desires, let us continue <lb/>
            joyfully in his service, knowing that through his intercession <lb/>
            we shall not lose our reward: and if St. Benedict did not <lb/>
            refuse his aid to one who had engaged to become a monk, <lb/>
            what must be the protection he will afford to those who <lb/>
            are actually bound by their voluntary engagements to the <lb/>
            rules of his discipline ? It is clearly manifested by many <lb/>

            plicate the Creator of the universe that he will bring us out <lb/>
            of Babylon and the land of the Chaldeans, and conduct us <lb/>
            to Jerusalem by the observance of his laws, and that He who <lb/>
            is the Almighty and merciful God will give us a place in the <lb/>
            company of the citizens above, to praise him who liveth and <lb/>

            coincidence with the description here given by our author. The two <lb/>

            the first six books, are evidently of the same age, and written by the same <lb/>

            he had a conference with King Lewis, son of Charles the <note type="footnote"> the three cities of Worms, Spire, and Mnyence, on its left bank. Charles <lb/>
            the Bald retained the countries situated between the Scheld, the Meuse, <lb/>
            the Rhone, the Ebro, and the two seas. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Charles the Bald died in a poor cottage on this side of the Mont- <lb/>
            Cenis, on the 6th of October, 877, in returning from Rome, and not on his <lb/>
            journey there. The contemporary chronicles call the place where the <lb/>
            violence of his disorder compelled him to stop, Brios. It is certain that it <lb/>
            must have been between the summit of the pass, which he had just crossed, <lb/>
            and the town of St. Jean-de-Maurienne, where the Empress Richilde, at <lb/>
            his instance, came to attend him. The principal places on the route are <lb/>
            St. Michel, Modane, and Lanslebourg, but these are considerable bourgs, <lb/>
            and would have afforded better accommodation to the dying emperor than <lb/>
            the " miserable cottage " spoken of by the chronicles. Besides, the road <lb/>
            did not then run by Modane. Every one who has crossed the Mont-Cenis <lb/>
            must have observed the succession of secluded villages in the beautiful <lb/>
            valley leading down to St. Jean-Maurienne, on the right bank of the Arc, <lb/>
            which the road followed till the year 1688. One of these is named <lb/>
            Avrieux, which appears to be the Brieux or Brios mentianed in the <lb/>
            chronicles. It is about eighteen English miles from St. Jean-Maurienne. <lb/>

            the Bald, of having ended his days by administering poison; the more <lb/>

            tender years named Charles the Simple, whom he entrusted <lb/>
            with his kingdom to the guardianship of the Prince Eudes.2</p>
          <p>At that time the pagan Northmen overran all France, <lb/>
            venting their fury in rapine, slaughter, and every kind of <lb/>
            barbarity. Thereupon the chiefs of the Franks, the Bur­ <lb/>
            gundians, and theAquitani, assembling together, unanimously <lb/>
            elected Eudes king.3 But he dying on the calends [1st] of <lb/>
            January, Charles the Simple, the son of Lewis, recovered <lb/>
            his throne.4 At this same time the Normans advanced into <lb/>
            Burgundy as far as St. Florentin, but Richard duke of Bur­ <lb/>
            gundy met them with his army at Tonnerre, and attack­ <lb/>
            ing them on the nones [8th] of June; numbers of them <lb/>
            fell by the edge of the sword, and the rest were put to <lb/>
            flight.5 The same year there was an earthquake near the <lb/>
            monastery of St. Columb the Virgin, on the fifth of the ides <lb/>
            [9th] of January.6 About the same period the pagans <lb/>
            besieged the city of Chartres, whereupon Richard, duke of <lb/>
            Burgundy, and the prince Robert, collecting an army, <lb/>

            France. About five years afterwards, on the calends <lb/>
            [1st] of February, fiery armies were seen in the heavens <lb/>
            of various colours pursuing each other in a wonderful <lb/>
            manner. The same year there was a sharp quarrel between <lb/>
            the king and his barons, which caused much slaughter of <lb/>
            Christian people, but through the mercy of God that con­ <lb/>
            troversy was brought to an end.</p>
          <p>In the third year after this calamity, Rodolph, duke of <lb/>
            Burgandy, died on the day before the calends [1st] of <lb/>
            September, and was buried in the church of St. Columb in <lb/>
            the oratory of St. Symphorian1 the martyr. The second <lb/>
            year after his death, Robert the prince revolted against <lb/>
            Charles the Simple, and received the royal unction on the <lb/>
            third of the calends of July [29th June]. Before a year <lb/>
            was expired, Charles the Simple gave battle to Robert at <lb/>
            the city of Soissons, in which battle Robert the pretender <lb/>
            to the throne of the Franks was slain.2 While, however, <lb/>
            Charles was retiring victorious from the carnage of the <lb/>
            battle,3 Herbert, the most abandoned of traitors, met him <lb/>
            and, under cover of pretended amity, induced him to accept <lb/>
            his proffered hospitality in the castle of Peronne, where <lb/>
            having thus deceitfully inveigled him, he detained him <lb/>
            prisoner: for Robert had married Herbert's sister,4 from <lb/>
            which union sprung Hugh the Great. In this strait Charles, <lb/>
            with the advice and consent of Hugh the Great, son of the <lb/>
            said Robert, and his nobles of France, raised to the throne <lb/>

            severe famine prevailed throughout all the kingdom of the <lb/>
            Franks, so that a muid of wheat was sold for twenty-four <lb/>
            pence. Not long afterwards King Lewis, son of Charles <lb/>
            the Simple, was, by contrivance of Hugh the Great, <lb/>
            treacherously made a prisoner by the Normans in the city of <lb/>
            Bayeux, where many of the Franks were massacred by the <lb/>
            people. After this, on Tuesday in the month of May,1 it <lb/>
            rained blood upon the labourers at work in the fields. The <lb/>

            Two years afterwards, in the month of August, Hugh the <lb/>
            Great laid siege to the city of Poitiers, but without success ; <lb/>
            for while he was engaged in the siege, on a certain day the <lb/>

            their forces attacked the Lorrainers, whom they defeated <lb/>

          <p>In the year of our Lord 977, the young King Lewis died, <lb/>
            having reigned over the Franks six years.' He was interred <lb/>
            in the church of St. Cornelius at Compiegne. He was suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded by his brother Charles, son of King Lothaire. The <lb/>
            same year Hugh, duke of France, revolted against him, <lb/>
            because he had married the daughter of Herbert count of <lb/>
            Troyes. Hugh assembled a very large army and laid siege <lb/>
            to Laon, where Charles had taken up his residence with his <lb/>
            queen. The king marched out of the city, and routing <lb/>
            Hugh and his army, burnt the huts in which they had been <lb/>
            quartered. Duke Hugh, finding that he could not conquer <lb/>
            Charles by open force made a league with Ascelin, an old <lb/>
            traitor, who had intruded himself into the bishopric of <lb/>
            Laon, and was counsellor of King Charles. In consequence, <lb/>
            Ascelin betrayed the city to Hugh,, duke of the Franks, in <lb/>
            the night-time, while the citizens were asleep, and Charles <lb/>
            and his wife were thrown into chains and conducted to <lb/>
            Orleans. He had not yet been anointed as king by reason <lb/>
            of Duke Hugh's opposition. While he was detained prisoner <lb/>
            in the Tower at Orleans, his wife bore him two sons, Lewis <lb/>
            and Charles. The same year Duke Hugh was crowned at <lb/>
            Rheims as king of the Franks, and in the course of the <lb/>
            same year his son Robert was also consecrated king. Thus <lb/>
            ended the dynasty of Charlemagne.2</p>
          <p>At that time Arnulph, a mild and excellent prelate, who <lb/>
            was brother of King Lothaire by a concubine of his father, <lb/>
            held the archbishopric of Rheims. He was hated by King <lb/>
            Hugh, who wished to exterminate the family of King <lb/>
            Lothaire. He therefore assembled a synod at Rheims, to <lb/>
            which he invited Sewin, archbishop of Sens, with his suffra­ <lb/>
            gans. In this council he caused the Lord Arnulph, the <lb/>
            archbishop of Rheims, to be degraded to the annoyance of <lb/>
            his nephew,3 whom he detained in prison, declaring that the <note type="footnote"> I Louis V. died the 21st of May, 987, at the age of about twenty years. <lb/>

            King Robert and of Leotheric, the archbishop who suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded the venerable Sewin. Arnulph was committed to <lb/>
            prison in the city of Orleans. But the worthy archbishop <lb/>
            Sewin was no party to the degradation of Arnulph and the <lb/>
            consecration of Gerbert. Some other bishops, with great <lb/>
            reluctance, were induced, by the king's threats, to degrade <lb/>
            the one and consecrate the other; but Sewin, fearing God <lb/>
            more than an earthly sovereign, refused his consent to the <lb/>
            iniquitous transaction, and, not only so, but he opposed to the <lb/>
            utmost of his power the royal wish, in consequence of which <lb/>
            the king's wrath was inflamed against him. The king <lb/>
            having caused Arnulph to be shamefully expelled from the <lb/>
            church of St. Mary, mother of God, at Rheims, thrust him <lb/>
            bound into prison, and then removed him in chains to a <lb/>
            dungeon at Orleans, where his nephew was a prisoner; and <lb/>
            he was confined there three years. These transactions were <lb/>
            reported to the pope of Rome, who, in great indignation, <lb/>
            suspended all the bishops who had degraded Arnulph and <lb/>
            consecrated Gerbert. He also sent the abbot Leo as legate <lb/>
            of the apostolic see to the Lord Sewin, archbishop of Sens, <lb/>
            with instructions to summon a synod at Rheims as the <lb/>
            pope's vicar, and commanding him, without delay, to recall <lb/>
            Arnulph from his confinement and degrade Gerbert. The <lb/>
            synod therefore being assembled, Arnulph was released from <lb/>
            his imprisonment by the apostolical command, and restored <lb/>
            with great honour to his own see. Gerbert being sensible <lb/>
            that he had illegally usurped the archiepiscopal authority <lb/>
            submitted to penance. The instructive controversy between <lb/>
            him and the abbot Leo may be found at length in the <lb/>
            archives of the archbishop of Rheims. After this the Lord <lb/>
            Gerbert was elected bishop of Ravenna by the Emperor <lb/>
            Otho and the people of that city, and having held the see <lb/>
            many years, was, on the death of the pope of Rome, called <lb/>
            by acclamation of the whole Roman people to succeed him. <lb/>

            In the year of our Lord 918, the king Hugh departed this <lb/>
            life,' and was interred in the church of St. Denys at Paris. <lb/>
            He was succeeded by his son Robert, the most pious and <lb/>
            temperate of kings.</p>
          <p>In the year of our Lord 999, the venerable Archbishop <lb/>
            Sewin began to restore the abbey of St. Peter at Melun from <lb/>
            the foundations, and establishing there a fraternity of monks, <lb/>
            appointed Walter their abbot. The same year, the knight <lb/>
            Walter and his wife betrayed the castle of Melun to Count <lb/>
            Eudes. Upon this, King Robert assembled a strong force <lb/>
            with Count Bouchard, and calling in the Normans under <lb/>
            their Duke Richard, laid siege to Melun. The castle being <lb/>
            taken, Walter and his wife were hung on a gallows, and <lb/>
            Melun was restored to Count Bouchard its former lord.2</p>
          <p>Now, Rainard, the old count of Sens, came to his end <lb/>
            after many evil practices, and was buried in the church of <lb/>
            St. Columb the virgin. He was succeeded by his son Fro­ <lb/>
            mond who had married the daughter of Reynold, count of <lb/>
            Rheims.</p>

            After his death the church of Sens was deprived of the epis­ <lb/>
            copal benediction for a whole year. All the people demanded <lb/>
            with acclamation that the Lord Leotheric, of a noble family, <lb/>
            who was then archdeacon and eminent for his virtues, should <lb/>
            be ordained. But opposition was made by some of the <lb/>
            clergy who aspired themselves to the archiepiscopal throne. <lb/>
            More especially Count Fromond, son of the old Rainard, <lb/>
            and thus sprung from a bad stock, forbade the appoint­ <lb/>

            Lorrainers, and other people, made a violent inroad into Italy <lb/>
            which he overran and besieged and assaulted Rome. The <lb/>

            the following note to the fragment preserved: Some things are wanting <lb/>

            mised them, he took possession of the city. Having <lb/>
            expelled Gregory VII. from the apostolic see, he shamefully <lb/>
            intruded in his place Guibert metropolitan of Ravenna. <lb/>
            Thereupon Gregory retired to Beneventum, and a great <lb/>
            schism was created throughout the world, which caused <lb/>
            much evil to the sons of the church, and long continued to <lb/>
            the injury of many persons.! Pope Gregory, whose name in <lb/>
            baptism was Hildebrand, had been a monk from his child­ <lb/>
            hood, and his whole life was a pattern of wisdom and <lb/>
            religion, maintaining a perpetual conflict against sin. <lb/>
            He rose through the several degrees of the ecclesiastical <lb/>
            orders to the popedom the summit of all, in which for sixteen <lb/>
            years he applied himself diligently to the observance of the <lb/>
            divine law. Inflamed with zeal for truth and justice he <lb/>
            denounced every kind of wickedness, sparing no offenders, <lb/>
            either through fear or favour. He therefore suffered perse­ <lb/>
            cution and exile from the stubborn and insubordinate, who <lb/>
            refused to submit to the Lord's yoke; yet no device of <lb/>
            theirs prevailed against him to the hour of his death.</p>
          <p>Pope Gregory repeatedly admonished and corrected, and <lb/>
            at length excommunicated Henry, king of the Germans, <lb/>
            as an incorrigible transgressor of the divine law. For that <lb/>
            prince deserted his wife, the daughter of the illustrious <lb/>
            count Eustace de Bouillon, and like a swine wallowing in <lb/>
            the mire abandoned himself to foul and adulterous pleasures, <lb/>
            disregarding the commandments of God and the admonitions <lb/>
            of good men. However, Godfrey duke of Lorraine, incensed <lb/>
            at the shameful repudiation of his sister, declared war <lb/>
            against Henry, and, collecting together a force of several <lb/>
            thousand troops, gave him battle, and forcing him to quit <lb/>
            the field in a shameful flight, thus revenged his sister's <lb/>
            wrongs.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 The emperor Henry IV., called by our author king of the Germans, <lb/>
            and the anti-pope Guibert, made their solemn entry into Rome on <lb/>
            Tuesday, March 21, 1084, by the Lateran gate; and on Palm Sunday, <lb/>
            the 24th of the same month, Guibert was consecrated at St. Peter's under <lb/>

            nobles whose wives or daughters or estates he coveted, and, <lb/>
            causing them to be privately way-laid by his emissaries, bad <lb/>
            them despatched on the road when they expected no evil. <lb/>
            This abandoned king disgraced himself by these and many <lb/>
            such enormities, dragging-with him the numerous accom­ <lb/>
            plices of his crimes to a common ruin. Pope Gregory, <lb/>
            receiving complaints of these iniquities, frequently implored <lb/>
            Henry to amend his life, but he wickedly laughed to scorn <lb/>
            his physician and doctor, and disregarded his remonstrances. <lb/>
            Gregory therefore held frequent councils with a great <lb/>
            number of prelates, consulting on the means of affording <lb/>
            relief to the Christian empire which Henry so foully and <lb/>
            infamously polluted. At last, finding that notwithstanding <lb/>
            his frequent admonitions Henry obstinately persisted in his <lb/>
            crimes, the pope excommunicated him according to the <lb/>
            sentence of a synod, deprived the obdurate prince of the <lb/>
            imperial power which he had damnably usurped, and by his <lb/>
            apostolical authority caused Count Conrad to be anointed <lb/>
            king by the hands of an assembly of bishops. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence Henry, deprived of his sceptre, remained quiet a <lb/>
            whole year in his own abode, shutting himself ap in the <lb/>
            county which was his own by right of inheritance. Mean­ <lb/>
            while, he lavishly employed the treasures he had amassed to <lb/>
            secure himself allies. Having thus collected a force of <lb/>
            many thousand accomplices, this public enemy, in contempt <lb/>
            of the decree of excommunication, broke into rebellion, <lb/>
            engaged in battle with King Conrad, and overthrew and <lb/>
            killed him, routing his army with losses of all kinds.1</p>
          <p>Elated with this victory, Henry re-assumed his imperial <note type="footnote"> received from the emperor's hands the investiture of the duchy of the <lb/>

            brother-in-law Henry, in March, 1077, by the influence of Gregory VII. <lb/>
            It was Rodolph who was slain fighting with Henry at the battle of <lb/>

            authority, coerced his rebellious subjects, and, having <lb/>
            strongly reinforced his army, laid siege to Rome, directing <lb/>
            all his efforts against Pope Gregory.1 It had, I consider, <lb/>
            entirely escaped his memory how Absalom, having gathered <lb/>
            a large force against his father David, had by the advice of <lb/>
            Ahithophel the Gilonite levied arms against him, attacking <lb/>
            his own father and his followers as they were departing from <lb/>
            Jerusalem, and caused at length the death of many thousand <lb/>
            warriors, but miserably perished when he had accomplished <lb/>
            his impious project to the loss of many. Thus Henry took <lb/>
            up arms against his father, and justly merited in return to <lb/>
            be cruelly persecuted by his own offspring. When he was <lb/>
            asked how he presumed to engage in such fearful enterprises <lb/>
            against the head of the church, he replied, laughing, that <lb/>
            the cause of this great quarrel between himself and the pope <lb/>
            was that the physician had recourse to remedies too violent <lb/>
            for an unruly patient.</p>
          <p>The lawless monarch therefore vigorously urged the siege <lb/>
            of Rome, alarmed the citizens with assaults and menaces, <lb/>
            seduced them with bribes and promises, and by such means <lb/>
            won over the people and got possession of the city. The <lb/>
            Romans thus deserting his cause, Pope Gregory took refuge <lb/>
            in Apulia, and, being received by the Normans with distin­ <lb/>
            guished honours, dwelt there four years and, having given <lb/>
            rules of life to the sons of the church, ended his labours.2 <lb/>
            Thereupon the emperor Henry uncanonically intruded into <lb/>
            the Lord's fold, Guibert, metropolitan of Ravenna, whom <lb/>
            they called Clement; on account of which a long and grievous <note type="footnote"> 1 The emperor arrived under the walls of Rome with the anti-pope <lb/>
            Guibert, a few days before Whitsuntide, 1081. The siege was not <lb/>

            numbers of persons by a twofold death. The people of <lb/>
            Milan and Mayence, and many others who espoused the party <lb/>
            of Guibert, not only excommunicated the friends of Gregory <lb/>
            but cruelly rose in arms against them. On the other hand <lb/>
            Gregory and his supporters invited the erring partisans of <lb/>
            Guibert to return to the unity of the church, and upon their <lb/>
            refusing to obey the summons excommunicated them accord­ <lb/>

          <p>Eudes, count of Sutri, who was nephew of the in­ <lb/>

            to the unfounded claims of a heretic.1 The Catholic church, <lb/>

            to the young prince. The discomfited Michael sought <lb/>
            refuge in Italy, humbly imploring the aid of the Normans <lb/>
            on behalf of himself and his family. The illustrious Duke <lb/>
            Guiscard received the imperial exile with due honours, <lb/>
            soothed his misfortunes by attentions and good offices, and <lb/>
            readily promised him his powerful aid. Nor did he delay in <lb/>
            taking determined measures for accomplishing the revenge <lb/>
            he had promised.1 But such not being the will of God, all <lb/>
            his vast preparations ended in vain threats, and it was not <lb/>
            permitted him to carry out the designs which he anxiously <lb/>
            entertained.</p>
          <p>Alexius, the general of the army, had by Michael's order <lb/>
            gone into Paphlagonia at the head of the Greek troops to <lb/>
            oppose the Turks, who claimed Nice, a city of Bithynia, as a <lb/>
            pledge of peace. Having received intelligence of the <lb/>
            expulsion of the lawful emperor, and the mad tyranny of <lb/>
            the traitorous usurper, he harangued his troops, and <lb/>
            demanded of them what was to be done. Alexius was <lb/>
            prudent and virtuous, brave, liberal, and a general favourite. <lb/>
            He was therefore received with universal acclamations, and <lb/>
            the whole army declared itself ready to obey his commands. <lb/>
            He therefore exhorted the troops to join unanimously in <lb/>
            besieging Byzantium, and manfully wrest it from the reek­ <lb/>
            less usurper of the imperial throne. Constantinople was <lb/>
            consequently closely invested for some days; but it was <lb/>
            opened to the besiegers by Raimond of Flanders, in concert <lb/>
            with the citizens, he being the chief warder of the gates, <lb/>
            and having the custody of the place entrusted to him. <lb/>
            Alexius took possession of the imperial palace, hurled <lb/>

            injury. Assuming the imperial sceptre and diadem, <lb/>
            amidst general rejoicings, he reigned thirty years with <lb/>
            firmness and dignity, both in prosperous and adverse <lb/>
            circumstances. He was a prince of great sagacity, com­ <lb/>
            passionate to the poor, a brave and magnanimous soldier, <lb/>
            affable to his army, to which he made liberal largesses, and <lb/>
            a devout observer of the Divine law. At the beginning of <lb/>
            his reign, he released from prison the son of Michael, who, <lb/>
            as before mentioned, had been deprived of sight, and placed <lb/>
            him under the care of the abbot of St. Cyrus. The young <lb/>
            prince, whose worldly career was ended, became a monk in <lb/>
            that monastery, and spent the rest of his life with the <lb/>
            servants of God. Alexius affectionately regarded and <lb/>
            kindly treated the daughters of Guiscard, as if they had <lb/>
            been his own, and nurtured them for almost twenty years <lb/>
            with the utmost indulgence. Their office was, every <lb/>
            morning, when the emperor had risen from his bed and was <lb/>
            washing his hands, to present him with a towel, and holding <lb/>
            an ivory comb, to dress the emperor's beard. Such was <lb/>
            the light and easy service assigned to these noble <lb/>
            females by a generous prince; and in the course of years <lb/>
            they were sent back to Roger, count of Sicily, by the kind <lb/>

            from it by Bitinacius, who, in his turn, was dethroned by <lb/>
            Alexius.</p>
          <p>In concert with the patriarch of the royal city, and the <lb/>
            wise men and senators of the Greek state, Alexius <lb/>
            resolved that the holy empire should not be restored to <lb/>
            Michael, who had sought refuge with the public enemy,1 and <lb/>
            had entrusted himself and his fortunes to the faithless <lb/>
            Normans, whose practice it was not to replace their allies in <lb/>
            their dominions, but to usurp their states, and to subject to <lb/>
            their own rule, and strip of their honours, by a refinement <lb/>
            of cruelty, those whom it should have been their duty to <lb/>
            liberate, and to aid in the recovery of their lawful authority. <lb/>
            Alexius therefore formed a close connection with the <lb/>
            English, who, with their chiefs, quitted England after the <lb/>
            death of King Harold, and, flying from the face of King <lb/>
            William, embarked on the Black Sea, and landed in Thrace. <lb/>
            He committed to their custody his principal palace, and the <lb/>
            royal treasures, and even made them the guards of his own <lb/>
            person and household.2 From the four quarters of the <lb/>
            globe bands of warriors assembled for the prize, which their <lb/>
            efforts to deprive him of his life and his throne might secure. <lb/>
            But all their efforts were fruitless; for under God's <lb/>
            protection he escaped the many plots of his enemies, and <lb/>
            living to a good old age associated with himself his son John <lb/>

            imploring the aid of the Italians with lamentations and <lb/>

            Normans and Lombards from all parts of his duchies of <lb/>
            Apulia and Calabria, and, having equipped a powerful fleet, <lb/>

            formidable resistance, towards the end of June he laid siege <lb/>
            to the place. His army did not consist of more than ten <lb/>
            thousand troops, but he relied more on the valour than on <lb/>

            young soldiers, who had recently arrived from Normandy, <lb/>
            took part in this expedition. Mark Bohemond, the son of <lb/>
            Guiscard by a Norman lady, seconded his father in his <lb/>
            absence, led a division of the army with great prudence, and, <lb/>
            exhibiting much discretion in the conduct of affairs, gave <lb/>
            promise of his future worth. His brother Robert, <lb/>

            inhabitants of Durazzo, assembled a powerful army, and <lb/>
            prepared to defeat the besiegers of his city in engagements <lb/>
            both by sea and land. While, however, the imperial mes­ <lb/>
            sengers were despatched in every direction, and bands of <lb/>
            soldiers were being collected from the islands and adjacent <lb/>
            provinces, it happened that one day Mark Bohemond going <lb/>
            out to forage at the head of fifty men-at-arms, found himself <lb/>
            . unexpectedly in face of five hundred light-armed troops, <lb/>
            who were in advance of the enemy's army, to carry succours <lb/>
            to the besieged. As soon as they perceived each other a <lb/>
            sharp encounter ensued, in which the Greeks, not being <lb/>
            able to sustain the charge of the Normans gave way and <lb/>
            abandoned a considerable booty. In this engagement they <lb/>
            left the brazen cross which the emperor Constantine, when <lb/>
            he was about to give battle to Maxentius, made in imitation <lb/>
            of the cross he had seen in the sky. The Normans, return­ <lb/>
            ing from the conflict, spread the greatest joy and hope of <lb/>
            victory among their comrades; while the Greeks were in <lb/>
            the greatest tribulation and despair at the loss of our <lb/>
            Lord's cross, which they strove hard to redeem for a very <lb/>
            large sum of gold.1 But Guiscard disdained any such bar­ <lb/>
            ter, esteeming for Christ's merits the brazen cross more <lb/>
            precious than all the gold in the world. He therefore <lb/>
            carried it with him through many dangers, and since his <lb/>
            death the convent of the Holy Trinity at Yenosa reverently <lb/>
            preserves it to this day, honouring it with many other relics <lb/>
            of the saints.</p>
          <p>In the month of October the emperor Alexius ap­ <lb/>
            proached Durazzo at the head of his legions, composed of <lb/>
            different nations. Battle was joined, with great effusion of <lb/>
            blood and vast loss on both sides in the severe encounter. <lb/>

            Guiscard. The emperor did not arrive before the besieged city until <lb/>
            October 15, when the skirmish between Bohemond and his advanced guard <lb/>
            here related occurred. The Labarum was not lost on this occasion, but at <lb/>

            with disgrace the forces of the East, who trusted in their <lb/>
            own might. Then Duke Robert, encouraged by so signal <lb/>
            a triumph, departed from Durazzo, and, after a long march, <lb/>
            wintered his army in Bulgaria; for the country about <lb/>
            Durazzo had been so devastated during the three months' <lb/>
            siege, that no subsistence was left there either for men or <lb/>
            horses.1</p>
          <p>At this time Duke Robert received envoys from Rome, <lb/>
            who were the bearers of apostolical letters, and humbly <lb/>
            saluting him, said, " Most valiant duke, Pope Gregory <lb/>
            earnestly and suppliantly entreats you, as a father his son, <lb/>
            to come to the aid of the apostolical see with your invin­ <lb/>
            cible courage, and not to suffer, for the love of God, any <lb/>
            excuse whatever to interfere with this succour: for <lb/>
            Henry, king of Germany, has laid siege to Rome, and <lb/>
            closely invested the pope and the clergy who adhere to him <lb/>
            in the castle of Crescens.2 Shut up in that fortress, with <lb/>
            a crowd of the faithful people, he is apprehensive of being <lb/>
            betrayed by the defection of the Roman populace, who are <lb/>
            greedy and versatile, and of being shamefully delivered into <lb/>
            the hands of his enemies. He has therefore sent us to you <lb/>
            to demand your speedy assistance in his urgent need. By <lb/>
            God's favour your might is established over all your foes, <lb/>
            nor can mortal power resist it while you are in arms for the <lb/>
            cause of God and are obedient to the vicar of St. Peter, the <lb/>
            prince of the apostles."</p>
          <p>On receiving this message the mighty lord was deeply <lb/>
            troubled, for he had a great desire to hasten to the succour <lb/>
            of the venerable pope, worried by fierce lions like Peter in <lb/>
            Herod's prison; while he strongly hesitated at leaving his <lb/>
            army, which he reckoned to be weak in numbers, among <lb/>
            hosts of crafty and cruel enemies, in a foreign land, without <lb/>
            a leader, like sheep among wolves. At length, having men- <note type="footnote"> 1 The battle was fought on October 18, three days after the arrival of <lb/>

            church.' By his help I shall comply with the pope's injunc­ <lb/>
            tions, endeavouring to return to you as quickly as I can. <lb/>
            Meanwhile remain quiet in this province, and be very cir­ <lb/>
            cumspect, surrounded as you are by enemies on every side. <lb/>
            If any one should venture to give you battle, in God's name <lb/>
            make a stout resistance. Take care however not to com­ <lb/>
            mence hostilities, nor to give the enemy an opportunity of <lb/>
            fighting, nor provoke the natives until I shall return. I <lb/>
            will undertake the service enjoined me by the Lord, and if <lb/>
            life is spared will soon be with you. I swear by the soul of <lb/>
            Tancred my father, and give you my solemn oath, that until <lb/>
            I return to you I will neither use the bath, nor have my <lb/>
            beard shaved, or my hair cut."</p>
          <p>After this speech the brave warrior set sail with a small <lb/>
            number of companions in arms, and by God's guidance <lb/>
            landed in Apulia, from whence, having assembled troops, he <lb/>
            marched to Home. Meanwhile the Emperor Henry, having <lb/>

            had gained over the emperor of Constantinople, and learn­ <lb/>
            ing that he was unexpectedly hurrying, with the speed of <lb/>
            lightning, to the pope's assistance, and taking these various <lb/>
            circumstances into mature consideration, he became greatly <lb/>
            alarmed, and having concluded a peace with certain of the <lb/>
            Roman nobles, and obtained possession of some part of the <lb/>
            city, he withdrew to the western provinces of his empire. <lb/>
            For he chose rather to take his departure freely in honour <lb/>
            and safety, than to wait for the arrival of his furious ad­ <lb/>
            versary, and involve himself in a whirlwind of war for which <lb/>
            he was unprepared. <note type="footnote"> 1 Notwithstanding all the fine words which our author has put into the <lb/>

            safety of his own states, which were threatened by local revolts and the <lb/>
            hostile demonstrations of the emperor. It was not until 1084, after <lb/>

            had married the sister of the prior William, son of Ingram, <lb/>
            and for some unknown and trifling cause, nurtured a secret <lb/>
            hatred of the abbot. In consequence, at the instigation of the <lb/>

            of his father Ishmael, who, by a criminal artifice, endea­ <lb/>
            voured to delude the unsuspecting Isaac. The man of God <lb/>

            holy communion, expired on the second of the ides [12th] <lb/>

            with the retreating citizens, and by order of their furious <lb/>

            entrance into Rome by fire and sword; nor did any of the <lb/>
            citizens afterwards venture to mutter a word against him. <lb/>
            As he drew near to the castle of Crescens, the pope with <lb/>

            for the toil he had undergone in coming to his aid, absolved <lb/>
            him from his sins as a reward for his obedience, and implored <lb/>

            and Telesphorus, Calixtus and Urban, Cornelius and Fabian ? <lb/>
            All these laboured, as bishops, for the cure of the diseased <lb/>

            bathed in tears, exclaimed, " Far be it from me that Rome <lb/>

            punishment of sinners. They are the enemies of our Creator <lb/>

            having prevailed with him to accept his counsel, came forth <lb/>
            from the tower of Crescens, and, followed by his clergy, and <lb/>
            attended by the duke and a strong band of troops, repaired <lb/>
            to Albano.1 That city was founded by Ascanius Julius, the <lb/>
            son of Æneas, and was given by the emperor Constantine <lb/>
            to Pope Silvester; thereupon, the duke having received the <lb/>
            apostolical benediction, marched in haste to the coast, and <lb/>
            crossing the sea without delay, rejoined his army as he had <lb/>
            sworn.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the crafty Greek emperor, when he learnt <lb/>
            that Robert was gone to Italy, thought that it would be in <lb/>
            his power to reduce the power of the Normans while their <lb/>
            leader was absent: he therefore, collecting a large body of <lb/>
            troops, marched against them, and compelled them to fight <lb/>
            a battle which they would have willingly avoided. In the be­ <lb/>
            ginning of the conflict, the Normans betrayed some weakness, <lb/>
            and at the first onset being under alarm on many accounts <lb/>
            were nearly worsted ; for disheartened by their inferiority of <lb/>
            numbers, and the absence of their successful leader, they had <lb/>
            scarcely commenced the battle, when they began to think of <lb/>
            flight. While, however, Bohemond and his troops were in <lb/>
            this state of hesitation and dismay, and in his anxiety he <lb/>
            fervently called upon God, he suddenly experienced the <lb/>
            divine aid, and a voice from heaven sounded in his ears: <lb/>
            " Bohemond, why do you shrink from the conflict ? Fight <lb/>
            it out bravely; for he who was your father's support will be <lb/>
            yours also, if you trust in him and faithfully maintain his <lb/>
            cause." The courage of the Normans was restored by <lb/>
            these words, and pressing onwards they charged the Greeks <lb/>
            with energy, so that they were repulsed by this sudden <lb/>
            attack, and taking to flight, left an immense booty to the <lb/>
            foreigners, who were in great need of supplies.2 <note type="footnote"> I The duke did not conduct the pope to Albano, having left him at the <lb/>
            palace of the Lateran. He did not depart himself for Illyria till the <lb/>
            month of September. Gregory VII. did indeed sojourn at Albano, but it <lb/>
            was in the year 1074, when he was on his way to Monte Cassino and <lb/>
            Capua. He arrived at Monte Cassino in the month of August, and did <lb/>
            not leave Capua on his return to Rome till the middle of- November. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Several statements in this paragraph are contrary to the facts. Bohe­ <lb/>

            highly rejoicing at their success, and he also exulting at so <lb/>
            signal a triumph returned thanks to God. Bohemond, who <lb/>
            had been wounded in the battle, was sent for his cure to the <lb/>
            surgeons of Salerno, whose reputation for skill in medicine <lb/>
            was established throughout the world.1</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the citizens of Durazzo, taking into account <lb/>
            that the Normans had penetrated far into Bulgaria, and had <lb/>
            detached by force of arms several provinces from the <lb/>
            Byzantine empire, as well as that they were entirely cut <lb/>
            off from receiving succours from the Thracians, Macedo­ <lb/>
            nians, and all their neighbours, began to lose their conn­ <lb/>
            dence, and consulted among themselves how they might <lb/>
            best escape from their difficult position. At length, the <lb/>
            most resolute among them determined on their course; <lb/>
            they secretly despatched a messenger to the duke, asking for <lb/>
            peace, and faithfully promising to deliver up the defence of <lb/>
            the city to his troops. The duke granted their demands, <lb/>
            and detached three hundred soldiers to take possession of <lb/>
            the place. The Normans arriving before it at night, were <lb/>
            admitted within the walls, and having established themselves <lb/>
            securely, peace was made between them and the citizens.2</p>
          <p>Sichelgade, wife of Robert Guiscard, was daughter of <lb/>
            Gaimard duke of Salerno,3 and sister of Gisulf who was <lb/>
            deprived of his duchy by the ambitious usurpation of his <lb/>
            brother-in-law.4 This princess conceived a violent hatred of <lb/>
            Bohemond her step-son, apprehending that as he was much <lb/>
            braver and superior in sense and worth, her son Roger would <lb/>
            forfeit in his favour the duchy of Apulia and Calabria to <lb/>
            which he was heir. In consequence, she prepared a deadly <lb/>
            potion and sent it to the physicians of Salerno, among whom <lb/>
            she had been brought up and by whom she had been <note type="footnote"> being nearly beaten at the battle of Larissa, and was obliged to cross into <lb/>

            instructed in the use of poisons. The physicians lent them­ <lb/>
            selves to the wishes of their lady and scholar, and gave the <lb/>
            deadly poison to Bohemond whom it was their duty to heal. <lb/>
            Having taken it, he was reduced to death's door, and <lb/>
            instantly despatched a messenger to his father informing him <lb/>
            of his danger. The shrewd duke became immediately aware <lb/>
            of his wife's treachery, and calling her to him in great dis­ <lb/>
            tress thus interrogated her. " Is my lord Bohemond still <lb/>
            alive?" To which she replied: "I know not, my lord." <lb/>
            Upon which he said: " Bring me a copy of the holy gospels <lb/>
            and a sword." On their being brought, he took the sword <lb/>
            and swore as follows upon the sacred writings : " Listen to <lb/>
            me, Sichelgade, I swear by this holy gospel that if my son <lb/>
            Bohemond dies of the malady under which he labours, I will <lb/>
            plunge this sword into your bosom." Alarmed at this <lb/>
            menace, she prepared a sure antidote and forthwith sent a <lb/>
            messenger with it to the physicians at Salerno who had <lb/>
            been her instruments for poisoning Bohemond, urging them <lb/>
            with prayers and promises to extricate her from the peril to <lb/>
            which she was exposed. The physicians learning that the <lb/>
            treachery was detected and the embarrassment of their lady, <lb/>
            prayed that the duke's terrible threats might not be put in <lb/>
            execution, and used every effort which their skill in the art <lb/>
            of medicine suggested to restore the young prince to health <lb/>
            Through Gop's blessing, who designed him for the scourge <lb/>
            of the Turks and Saracens, the enemies of the faith, Bohe­ <lb/>
            mond recovered; but such had been the virulence of the <lb/>
            poison that his countenance was pallid all the rest of his <lb/>
            life.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the treacherous and wily woman reflected <lb/>
            within herself, in a state of great alarm, that if her messen­ <lb/>
            ger should meet with any delay in crossing the sea, and the <lb/>
            sick prince should die before he arrived, there would be no <lb/>
            escaping the death which her husband had sworn to inflict <lb/>
            on her. She therefore devised another murderous and <lb/>
            execrable scheme. Sad to say, she gave poison to her <lb/>
            husband. And as soon as he began to sicken, having no <lb/>
            doubt of the inevitable result, she assembled her attendants <lb/>
            and the rest of the Lombards in the middle of the night, and <lb/>
            hurrying to the sea shore embarked with her partisans in <lb/>
            the swiftest ships, burning the rest that she might not be <pb n="368"/>

            pursued by the Normans. Having reached the coast of <lb/>
            Apulia, one of the knights who attended her landed privately <lb/>
            and hastening to Salerno by night suddenly appeared before <lb/>
            Bohemond, saying: " Rise quickly and fly and save yourself." <lb/>
            On his inquiring the reason, the bearer of the tidings replied: <lb/>
            " Your father has perished, and your mother has landed in <lb/>
            Apulia. She is hurrying here to seek your death." Bohe­ <lb/>
            mond, on hearing this alarming intelligence, was greatly <lb/>
            agitated, and mounting an ass, clandestinely withdrew from <lb/>
            the city and fled to Jordan, prince of Capua, his cousin,' by whom <lb/>
            he was kindly received, and thus escaped from the machina­ <lb/>
            tions and threats of his stepmother. She was much mortified <lb/>
            on arriving at Salerno, that she had been outwitted by the <lb/>
            object of her persecutions. Her son Roger, surnamed <lb/>
            Crumena, secured the succession to the rich duchy of his <lb/>
            ancestors lying on this side of the sea.2</p>
          <p>The Normans who found themselves in a foreign country <lb/>
            with their great and brave leader in the utmost peril from a <lb/>
            woman's wiles were overwhelmed with anxieties. They felt <lb/>
            also that the strength of their army was diminished by the <lb/>
            defection of the Lombards who had secretly departed in <lb/>
            attendance on their mistress, and that they could not return <lb/>
            to Italy without great difficulty and delay, as their ships <lb/>
            were burnt. The noble duke therefore summoned to his <lb/>
            side Robert count de Loritello,3 and Geoffrey de Conversana, <lb/>
            his nephews, Hugh Le Borgne of Clermont,4 and William de <lb/>

            scourges us for our sins, and punishes us for our ambition. <lb/>
            The Lord justly chastises his servants and plainly teaches <lb/>
            us that worldly glory is not to be coveted. Let us give him <lb/>
            thanks for all the favours which he has vouchsafed to confer <lb/>
            upon us, and implore him with our whole hearts that he will <lb/>
            always show mercy to us. We were sprung from poor and <lb/>
            obscure parents, and leaving the barren fields of the Cotentin <lb/>
            and homes ill supplied with the means of existence, we set out <lb/>
            for Rome, and it was not without great difficulty and much <lb/>
            alarm that we passed beyond that place. Afterwards, by <lb/>
            God's aid, we got possession of many great cities. But we <lb/>
            ought to attribute our success not to our own valour or <lb/>
            merits, but to divine Providence. Now at length, for the <lb/>
            sins of the natives, we have wrested from the empire of <lb/>
            Constantinople as much country as it has taken us fifteen <lb/>
            days to penetrate. You know well, that I was invited to <lb/>
            undertake the protection of the emperor Michael who was <lb/>
            unjustly driven from his throne by his subjects, my daughter <lb/>
            having been lawfully betrothed to his son. I had deter­ <lb/>
            mined, if it pleased God, that Constantinople, which is in <lb/>
            possession of an unwarlike people abandoned to pleasure and <lb/>
            lasciviousness, should be subjugated to Catholic warriors, <lb/>
            who would deliver Jerusalem, God's holy city, from the <lb/>
            Turks, and expelling the infidels by their victorious arms <lb/>
            enlarge the bounds of Christendom. It was for this purpose <lb/>
            that I undertook so vast an enterprise, so perilous a conflict. <lb/>
            The mysterious will of Almighty God has otherwise ordered. <lb/>
            David formed the design of building the temple at Jerusalem <lb/>
            to God's honour, but God decreed that this should be accom­ <lb/>
            plished with great triumph by his son Solomon. So I con­ <lb/>
            ceive that my enterprise will be completed in future years, <lb/>
            and the fruit of my labours will one day appear, and they <lb/>
            will be profitably cited to posterity as an incitement to the <lb/>

            do not lose your former courage which I have often proved <lb/>

            canvassing the duke's proposals, thus replied; " There is <lb/>
            much danger and great difficulty in the injunctions you lay <lb/>
            on us. Our enemies are countless, while we are few in <lb/>
            number, and we have opposed to us a powerful and saga­ <lb/>
            cious emperor, to whom at your instance we have often <lb/>
            given grave offence. We are unable to resist his prowess <lb/>
            and wide-spread power, for his rule extends over many <lb/>
            kingdoms and nations. Would to God we could return in <lb/>
            peace and safety to the homes from which we departed."</p>
          <p>The duke groaned deeply on hearing these sentiments, and <lb/>
            began calling upon God, with tears, and lamenting his son <lb/>
            with bitter grief: "Alas! what sorrows surround me in my <lb/>
            misfortunes ! In times past I have done much injury, and <lb/>
            many of my actions have been unjust; now the punishments <lb/>
            which I deserved long since have accumulated upon me. <lb/>
            Most High God, spare me! merciful God, have pity upon me <lb/>
            a sinner! Almighty God, succour thy people whom I have <lb/>
            led hither! O my son Bohemond, the equal of Epaminondas <lb/>
            the Theban in valour and wisdom, where shall I find thee ? <lb/>
            Bohemond, thou noble warrior, who may be compared in <lb/>
            arms to the Thessalian Achilles or Roland the Frank, do <lb/>
            you yet live, or are you detained for your destruction ? What <lb/>
            has happened to thee ? What has become of your proved <lb/>
            courage ? If you were in health as I left you when I parted <lb/>
            for Italy, you would quickly be here and take possession of <lb/>
            this rich region of Bulgaria conquered by our arms. For <lb/>
            I feel assured that, if you live, such is your resolution that if <lb/>
            divine providence allowed you to be present at my death, <lb/>
            you would by God's help never cede the rights I have gained <lb/>
            by arms. Courage, my valiant comrades ! consider carefully <lb/>
            among yourselves, and weigh well that you are far away <lb/>
            from your own homes. Recollect what great deeds the <lb/>
            Normans have wrought, and how often our fathers have <pb n="371"/>

            resisted the French, the Bretons, and the people of Maine, <lb/>
            and bravely conquered them. Recall to your minds the <lb/>
            great exploits you have performed, with me for your leader, in <lb/>
            Italy and Sicily, when you reduced Salerno and Bari, <lb/>
            Brundisium and Tarento, Bismano1 and Reggio, Syracuse and <lb/>
            Palermo, Cosenza and Castro-Giovanni, and many other <lb/>
            cities and towns. By God's assistance, you subdued under my <lb/>
            command Gisulf duke of Salerno, Waszo, count of Naples,2 <lb/>
            and many other powerful princes.. Strive therefore not to <lb/>
            lower your position by the loss of your former magnanimity. <lb/>
            Choose one of yourselves, as I said before, by mutual agree­ <lb/>
            ment, and retain with honour the fertile provinces which <lb/>
            you have now gained."</p>
          <p>Of all those who were present at this council, no one dared <lb/>
            to assume the command, all preferring to provide for their <lb/>
            safety by flight. At length, in the year of our Lord 1085, <lb/>
            Robert Guiscard, the illustrious duke of Apulia, a man <lb/>
            whose equal can scarcely be found in our times, having con­ <lb/>
            fessed and been absolved from his sins, and fortified by <lb/>
            receiving the holy communion, as the hour of death approach­ <lb/>
            ed, was taken from the world, not struck down by a warrior's <lb/>
            arm, but infected by a woman's crime as at first Adam was <lb/>
            driven out of paradise, not the victim of war but of poison. <lb/>
            As soon as he was dead, the Normans preserved his body in <lb/>
            salt, and demanded permission to depart in peace to their own <lb/>
            country. Though the emperor rejoiced at being freed from <lb/>
            his formidable enemy, yet he wept with much feeling over <lb/>
            the deceased duke who had never turned back in battle.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Bismanus, Bismantus, Bismantum, Bismantoa, a village and mountain <lb/>

            of the name of Odo would be pope of Rome. When <lb/>
            Odo, bishop of Bayeux, who, under his brother King <lb/>
            William, had the chief rule over the Normans and English, <lb/>
            heard this, he made light of the authority and wealth which <lb/>
            the government of a western kingdom conferred, and aspired <lb/>
            to the papal power which would give him wider sway and <lb/>
            raise him above all earthly princes. He therefore despatched <lb/>
            his emissaries to Rome, where he purchased a palace, and <lb/>
            conciliating the senators by magnificent gifts, he ornamented <lb/>
            his residence with lavish expense and costly superfluities. <lb/>
            Attaching to his person Hugh, earl of Chester, and a goodly <lb/>
            company of distinguished knights, he engaged them to attend <lb/>
            him to Italy, by prodigal promises added to his entreaties. <lb/>
            The Normans are ever given to change and desirous of <lb/>
            visiting foreign lands, and they therefore readily joined <lb/>
            themselves to the aspiring prelate whose ambition was not <lb/>
            satisfied by the dominion of England and Normandy. In <lb/>
            consequence they resolved on abandoning the vast estates <lb/>
            which they possessed in the west of Europe, and pledged <lb/>
            themselves to attend the bishop beyond the Po.' <note type="footnote"> this pope, pronounced at the point of death, are well known : " I have <lb/>
            loved justice ar.d hated iniquity; therefore I die in exile." But the mag­ <lb/>
            nificent reply of one of the prelates who attended him is not so commonly <lb/>
            known: "You, my lord, cannot die in exile, for as the vicar of Christ and <lb/>
            his apostles, you have received the nations for your inheritance, and the <lb/>
            utmost parts of the earth for your possession." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 M. Le Prévost remarks that, notwithstanding the vanity and ambition <lb/>
            of Odo were equal to his avarice, there is difficulty in believing that the <lb/>
            bishop ever seriously contemplated obtaining the papacy, or even fixing his <lb/>
            residence near a pontiff of such rigid morals and resolute character as <lb/>
            Gregory VII., in the midst also of all the difficulties and dangers which <lb/>
            arose out of the contest between the chief of the church and the emperor, <lb/>
            seconded by the anti-pope Guibert, which was then at its highest pitch <lb/>
            of violence. Our brother editor conjectures that Odo, ill-informed of the <lb/>
            obstacles which these two personages raised to free communication with <lb/>
            the legitimate pope, only proposed to exhibit his pomp at the council COIl­ <lb/>
            yoked for the autumn of the following year. It is, however, scarcely to <lb/>
            be supposed that the bishop of Bayeux would have taken the steps related <lb/>
            by our author for a merely temporary purpose. History is not without an <lb/>
            example of English wealth spent for a more chimerical purpose in the <lb/>
            case of Richard's (earl of Cornwall) ambition for the empty title of king <lb/>
            of the Romans. Wolsey, too, whose character in many respects was <lb/>
            singularly identical with that of Odo, made pretensions to the papacy. On <lb/>
            the whole we are led to conclude that the bishop's real intentions had <lb/>
            transpired, and that our historian's statements are at least founded on </note> <pb n="374"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [B. VII. CH.VIII. </note> The wise king William speedily heard of these prepara­ <lb/>
            tions, but the scheme did not meet his approbation, for he <lb/>
            considered that it was fraught with injury to his own king­ <lb/>
            dom as well as to others. He therefore lost no time in crossing <lb/>
            the sea, and at the isle of Wight presented himself unexpect­ <lb/>
            edly to bishop Odo, when he was on the point of sailing for <lb/>
            Normandy with a pompous retinue. Having assembled the <lb/>
            great nobles of the realm in his royal court, the king thus <lb/>
            addressed them;­</p>
          <p>"Illustrious lords, listen attentively to what I shall say, <lb/>
            and give me, I pray you, salutary counsel. Before I went <lb/>
            over to Normandy, I entrusted the government of England <lb/>
            to my brother the bishop of Bayeux. There were in <lb/>
            Normandy many who revolted against my authority, and, if <lb/>
            I may so say, both friends and foes set themselves against <lb/>
            me. Even my own son Robert, and the young nobles whom I <lb/>
            had brought up and invested with the ensigns of knighthood <lb/>
            rebelled against me, while some traitorous vassals and my <lb/>
            border foes eagerly joined the ranks of the malcontents. But <lb/>
            by God's help, whose servant I am, they failed of success, and <lb/>
            got nothing from me but the sword which pierced them with <lb/>
            wounds. By the terror of my arms I restrained the people of <lb/>
            Anjou, who were leagued for war against me, and I also <lb/>
            curbed the rebellious inhabitants of Maine. Thus occupied, <lb/>
            I found myself embarrassed by affairs beyond sea, and was <lb/>
            long detained labouring earnestly for the public good. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, my brother grievously oppressed the English, <lb/>
            robbing the churches of their lands and revenues, and <lb/>
            stripping them of the ornaments with which our forefathers <lb/>
            enriched them ; while he seduced my knights, whose duty it <lb/>
            was to defend England against the Danes and Irish, and <lb/>
            other enemies who threatened hostilities, and has made <lb/>
            preparations, in contempt of me, for transporting them into <lb/>
            foreign regions beyond the Alps. My heart is overwhelmed <lb/>
            with grief, especially on account of the injury he has done to <lb/>
            the churches of God. The Christian kings who reigned <lb/>
            before me were devoted to the church, on which they heaped <note type="footnote"> what he thought credible authority. The accurate Malmesbury says that <lb/>
            Odo " by stuffing the scrips of the pilgrims with letters and money, had <lb/>
            nearly purchased the Roman papacy from the citizens. — B. ii. p. 307, <lb/>

            honours and gifts of every kind, and hence, as we believe, <lb/>
            they now repose in the seats of bliss, rejoicing in their <lb/>
            glorious rewards. Ethelbert, Edwin and St. Oswald, <lb/>
            Ethelwulfa and Alfred, Edward the elder and Edgar, with <lb/>
            Edward my cousin and most dear lord, richly endowed our <lb/>
            holy church, which is the spouse of Christ. And now, my <lb/>
            brother, to whom I entrusted the care of my entire kingdom, <lb/>
            has laid violent hands on her substance, has cruelly oppressed <lb/>
            the poor, has seduced my knights on frivolous pretences, and <lb/>
            has spread disorder through the whole of England by his <lb/>
            unjust exactions. Consider then prudently what is to be <lb/>
            done, and let me know, I pray you, what you advise."</p>
          <p>All the council, however, being restrained by fear of the <lb/>
            powerful prelate, and hesitating to make a decision against <lb/>
            him, the stout-hearted king said A dangerous ambition <lb/>
            must always be curbed, and an individual must not be <lb/>
            spared, for favour or affection, to the public detriment. <lb/>
            Let this man therefore who disturbs the state be arrested, <lb/>
            and closely confined, that he may not do further mischief." <lb/>
            No one however daring to lay hands on a bishop, the king <lb/>
            was the first to seize him, upon which Odo cried out, " I am <lb/>
            a clerk, and the Lord's minister; it is not lawful to condemn <lb/>
            a bishop without the judgment of the pope." To which the <lb/>
            prudent king replied: "I do not condemn a clerk or a <lb/>
            bishop, but I arrest an earl I have myself created,1 and to <lb/>
            whom, as my vicegerent, I entrusted the government of my <lb/>
            realm, it being my will that he should render an account of <lb/>
            the stewardship I have committed to him."</p>
          <p>In this manner the royal authority was exerted to arrest <lb/>
            the bishop, who was conducted to Normandy, and being <lb/>
            imprisoned in the castle of Rouen, was kept there in close <lb/>
            custody four years, that is, as long as the king lived.2 The <lb/>
            chief disturber of the peace being thus laid low, the knights <lb/>
            returned to their duty, and, by the king's wisdom, his throne <lb/>
            was fortified against all attacks from within or without.</p>

          <p>AFTER the death of the glorious Queen Matilda, King <lb/>

            disturb the peace of others, and disquiet themselves by their <lb/>
            love of change, flew to arms against the king, and occasioned <lb/>
            great expenditure and damage in their own state, as well <lb/>
            as to many others. Hubert, the viscount, son-in-law of <lb/>
            William, Comte de Nevers,1 gave umbrage to the king at <lb/>
            first on some trivial occasions, but his delinquencies after­ <lb/>
            wards increasing, he retired from his castles of Beaumont <lb/>
            and Fresnai,2 and established himself, as a public enemy, <lb/>
            with his wife and all his followers, at the castle of Ste. <lb/>
            Suzanne.3 The fortress in which he took refuge stands on <lb/>
            a high rock above the river Erve, on the borders of Maine <lb/>
            and Anjou. He assembled there a band of soldiers, and <lb/>
            lost no time in inflicting loss on the Normans, who were <lb/>
            employed in guarding the country of Maine, and keeping <lb/>
            them in constant alarm. The viscount was a man of <lb/>
            illustrious lineage, distinguished for his talent and conduct, <lb/>
            and full of courage and enterprising boldness, qualities <lb/>
            which established his reputation far and wide. The <lb/>
            garrisons of the city of Mans, and the neighbouring castles, <lb/>
            were kept in constant alarm by Hubert's incursions, in <lb/>
            consequence of which they laid their complaints before King <lb/>
            William, and implored his aid.</p>
          <p>Upon this the king assembled troops in Normandy <lb/>
            without delay, and, summoning such of the people of Maine <lb/>
            as were friendly to him, entered the enemy's country with a <lb/>
            powerful force. He did not however venture to lay siege to <lb/>
            the castle of Ste. Suzanne, it being rendered impregnable by <lb/>
            its position on rocks, and the dense thickets of vineyards <lb/>
            which surrounded it, nor could he closely confine the enemy <lb/>
            within the fortress as he desired, as he was strong enough to <lb/>
            command supplies, and was master of the communications. <lb/>
            The king therefore constructed a fortified camp in the <lb/>
            valley of Bonjen,4 and placed in it a strong body of troops to <note type="footnote"> 1 Hubert de St. Suzanne, viscount of Maine, married, Dec. 6, 1067, <lb/>

            check the enemy's incursions, being obliged to return into <lb/>
            Normandy himself on weighty affairs. The royal troops, <lb/>
            under the command of Alan-the-Red, count of Brittany,1 <lb/>
            made a brilliant display of wealth, feasting, and military <lb/>
            array, but the garrison of the castle was superior in valour <lb/>
            and numbers. For knights of established fame hastened to <lb/>
            Hubert's standard from Aquitain, Burgundy, and other <lb/>
            provinces of France, anxious for an opportunity of rendering <lb/>
            him earnest aid and displaying their own intrepidity. <lb/>
            Hence it happened that the castle of Ste. Suzanne was <lb/>
            supplied at the expense of those who were encamped at <lb/>
            Bonjen, and their means of resistance were continually <lb/>
            increased. Many wealthy nobles of Normandy and <lb/>
            England were taken prisoners, and their ransoms honour­ <lb/>
            ably enriched the viscount, and Robert of Burgundy, whose <lb/>
            niece he had married, with his other comrades. In this <lb/>
            manner Hubert resisted the Normans for three years, and, <lb/>
            growing rich by his enemies' wealth, foiled all their assaults. <lb/>
            In this war, Robert de Vieux-Pont, Robert d'Ussi, and other <lb/>
            gallant Norman knights were slain. On the fourteenth of <lb/>
            the calends of December [18th November], while the <lb/>
            Norman troops were on the march to attack the enemy, a <lb/>
            beardless youth, concealed in the bushes by the road-side, <lb/>
            shot an arrow, which mortally wounded Richer de Laigle, son <lb/>
            of Engenulf,2 piercing his eye. His followers rode up, <lb/>
            burning with rage, and, seizing the youth, would have <lb/>
            avenged the noble Richer by putting him to death on the <lb/>
            spot, but the dying baron saved his life. For when they <lb/>
            were on the point of cutting the youth's throat, the <lb/>
            wounded man with a violent effort cried out: " Sparc <lb/>
            him, for the love of God; it is for my sins that I am <lb/>
            called thus to die." His assassin being dismissed, the <lb/>
            lamented lord confessed his sins to his companions in arms, <lb/>
            and expired before they could convey him to the city. The <lb/>
            corpse was borne to the convent of monks which his father <note type="footnote"> by forty wide. The walls appear to have been about six feet high, and the <lb/>

            Richer had founded on his domains in honour of St. <lb/>
            Sulpitius, bishop of Bourges;1 and he was buried there, <lb/>
            with great lamentations of his kinsfolk and connexions, by <lb/>
            Gilbert, the venerable bishop of Evreux.</p>
          <p>This lord was deservedly regretted by his acquaintance <lb/>
            for the many virtues with which he was endowed. In <lb/>
            person he was strong, handsome, and active; a faithful <lb/>
            observer of the divine law, courteous and humble with men <lb/>
            of religion, prudent and eloquent in worldly affairs, and <lb/>
            gentle and liberal in all his conduct. He married Judith, <lb/>
            daughter of Richard of Avranches,2 surnamed Goz, and <lb/>
            sister of Hugh, earl of Chester, by whom he had Gilbert <lb/>
            de Laigle, Engenulf, Matilda, and several other sons and <lb/>
            daughters. They all died except Gilbert, who became the <lb/>
            heir to his father's virtues, estates, and honours. He married <lb/>
            Juliana, daughter of Geoffrey, the brave count de Mortagne, <lb/>
            who bore him Richer, Engenulf. Geoffrey, and Albert; the <lb/>
            second and third of whom perished by shipwreck with <lb/>
            William the Etheling,3 King Henry's son, and many other <lb/>
            nobles, on the eighth of the calends [25th] of November! <lb/>
            His sister Matilda,5 married Robert de Mowbray, the <lb/>
            powerful earl of Northumberland,6 who rebelled the same <lb/>
            year against William Rufus, king of England. But, being <lb/>
            taken prisoner shortly afterwards, he was detained in cap­ <lb/>
            tivity for nearly thirty-four years by that king and his <lb/>
            brother Henry, living to an advanced age without having <lb/>
            any children. I now return to the events from which I <lb/>
            have somewhat digressed.</p>
          <p>In the month of January, William de Warrene, Baudri <lb/>
            de Guitri, son of Nicholas, and Gilbert de Laigle, who <lb/>
            sought to avenge the death of his brother Richer, made a <lb/>
            desperate assault on the garrison of Ste. Suzanne, with a <lb/>
            strong band of Normans, but they gained nothing but the <lb/>
            steel in their wounds.

            d'Evreux,1 was made prisoner, and Matthew de Vitot,2 son of <lb/>
            Godfrey the Little, mortally wounded. Being carried to <lb/>
            his quarters by his sorrowing squires and comrades, a priest <lb/>
            was sent forth, and having confessed his sins and received <lb/>
            the comfort of the holy viaticum, he was then prepared for <lb/>
            the approach of death.</p>
          <p>The Normans who held the entrenched camp in the <lb/>
            valley of Bonjen, having suffered serious losses, and had <lb/>
            their numbers thinned by the swords of the bravest knights, <lb/>
            were apprehensive of still greater discomfiture. Finding <lb/>
            that they were no match for Hubert, either by their valour <lb/>
            or good fortune, they changed their plan, and tried to bring <lb/>
            him to an agreement with the king. The viscount, although <lb/>
            in the present contest he had greatly advanced his power <lb/>
            and wealth, was so sensible of the value of peace and <lb/>
            security, that he prudently fell in with the plans of the <lb/>
            mediators. No time was lost in despatching envoys to the <lb/>
            king, who was now in England; and William, finding that <lb/>
            Hervey the Breton, whom he had appointed to the command <lb/>
            of the troops,3 with Richer and other brave knights, had <lb/>
            fallen in battle, and that his adversary, in the enjoyment of <lb/>
            his good fortune, found his position become daily stronger, <lb/>
            was careful not to make matters worse by an obstinate per­ <lb/>
            sistance in hostilities. He, therefore, prudently pardoned <lb/>
            the viscount for all his past offences, and having granted <lb/>
            him a safe conduct, Hubert crossed the sea, and, coming to <lb/>
            court on terms of amity, was honourably restored to all his <lb/>
            father's rights. The people of Normandy and Maine, who <lb/>
            had deeply suffered for four years4 in the prolonged conflict, <lb/>

            assert his claims in right of his ancestors Sweyn and <lb/>
            Canute, who had formerly subjugated it. This king was <lb/>

            desirous of learning the will of God, entered a church, and <lb/>
            humbly kneeling before the altar, besought him with tears <lb/>
            to direct his course according to his goodwill. His brother, <lb/>

            Calomanoth, the king's brother, the assassin being banished. <lb/>
            The body of King Canute was honourably interred in the <lb/>
            church, where many miracles were performed at his tomb. <lb/>
            A great convent for monks was afterwards built, and the mo­ <lb/>
            nastic discipline there established, after the same order as <lb/>
            that of Evesham in England.2 For from thence it was <note type="footnote"> as OUT author supposes, but more than a year before the Conqueror's <lb/>
            death. </note><note type="footnote"> I Ordericus has given an entirely erroneous account of the circumstances <lb/>
            connected with the tragic end of the Danish king. After the assemblage <lb/>
            of the armament intended for the invasion of England in the gulf of Lym­ <lb/>
            fiord, in Finland, some delays occurred which created impatience among <lb/>
            the troops, and they deputed the prince Olaf to remonstrate with the <lb/>
            king his brother. Canute, however, was greatly irritated at this insubordi­ <lb/>
            nation, and suspecting Olaf of having fomented it, sent him prisoner <lb/>
            under arrest to the earl of Flanders. The armament then dispersed, and <lb/>
            Canute treated the malcontents with excessive rigour, and imposed a tax <lb/>
            in the shape of tithes most odious to the Scandinavian nations. At last <lb/>
            the people broke into open rebellion, and the king took refuge in Zealand. <lb/>
            There a traitor named Black invited him to Odensee, representing that his <lb/>
            presence would appease the people ; but he had scarcely entered the <lb/>
            church of St. Alban, accompanied by his two brothers, Benedict and Eric, <lb/>
            when Black introduced the conspirators. Canute was slain after a short <lb/>
            resistance in which Benedict and some of the officers of his suite fell. <lb/>
            Olaf, whom he had shortly before invested with the duchy of Sleswig, and <lb/>

            <title type="sub">On. XII. Legend of the translation of the relics of St. Nicholas, bishop and confessor,from Myra, in Asia Minor, to Bari, in Italy.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1087, the tenth indiction, on the <lb/>
            nones [9th] of May, the body of St. Nicholas, archbishop <lb/>
            and confessor, was translated from Myri to Bari. John, <lb/>
            archdeacon of Bari, has eloquently related in what manner <lb/>
            and by whom this translation was effected.2 I propose to <lb/>
            make some extracts from his narrative, and insert in my <lb/>
            present work a short notice of this remarkable event, for <note type="footnote"> martyr of England, whose relics by some unaccountable means are said to <lb/>
            have found their way to Denmark, and have been deposited in this church. <lb/>
            One account says that they were carried off from the abbey at St. Albans <lb/>
            in 914, at a time when the invaders were still (for the most part at least) <lb/>
            heathens; another that they were purloined from Canterbury, and translated <lb/>
            to Odensee in 1085, the monk Elnoth, the biographer of Canute, accom­ <lb/>
            panying them, and the transaction escaping the cognizance of King Wil­ <lb/>
            liam. They were deposited in a wooden church at first dedicated to the <lb/>
            Virgin, but which speedily assumed the name of its new patron. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The relics of St. Canute, which had been inclosed in a magnificent <lb/>
            shrine after his canonization, were ejected from it at the era of the Re­ <lb/>
            formation, but were visited in the years 1582 and 1696, and again dis­ <lb/>
            covered, Jan. 24, 1833, in a cavity in the east wall of of the stone church <lb/>
            which had been substituted for the wooden edifice just mentioned. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It bears this title: " Translatio S. Nicolai episcopi ex Myra Lyciæ <lb/>

            write.</p>
          <p>In the time of the emperor Alexius, the Turks and other <lb/>
            infidel nations vented their fury by making an irruption <lb/>
            beyond their frontiers, and, by God's permission, devastated <lb/>
            Lycia and other Christian countries, destroyed the churches <lb/>
            for the sins of the faithful, profaned the crosses, and images, <lb/>
            and sanctuaries of Christ, and gave to the flames a number <lb/>
            of cities with their inhabitants. Their ravages continued <lb/>
            for many years, and multitudes of Christians fell a sacrifice <lb/>
            to their cruelty.</p>
          <p>During this time Myra, the capital of Lycia,1 fell into the <lb/>
            hands of the Turks, being evacuated by its own citizens, for <lb/>
            the punishment of their sins. Meanwhile, some people of <lb/>
            Bari, who were on their way to Antioch, in three ships,2 <lb/>
            for the purpose of trade, approaching joyfully to the huts <lb/>
            which some of the Myrians occupied, sent forward a certain <lb/>
            pilgrim to the church of St. Nicholas, which stands in the <lb/>
            town,3 to make observations. On his return he reported <lb/>
            that a great number of Turks were assembled to perform <lb/>
            the obsequies of the head man of the town, who then lay <lb/>
            dead. On hearing this, the Barians forthwith set sail, and <lb/>
            turning the prows of their vessels towards Antioch, having <lb/>
            a favourable wind, they reached Myra4 in the course of a few <note type="footnote"> 1 This conquest of Lycia by Solyman must have occurred at the time <lb/>
            when he overran Caramania, that is, in 1084 and 1085. It appears that <lb/>
            Myra was not taken till 1086. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Sixty persons were embarked in the three ships, viz. forty-seven <lb/>
            inhabitants of Bari (among whom were two priests and a clerk, the others <lb/>
            being merchants and armed mariners), a pilgrim, and twelve foreign <lb/>
            passengers. The ships were on their voyage to Antioch with cargoes of <lb/>
            wheat, for which they were to receive in return the products of the East <lb/>
            for the merchants of Bari. On the voyage they fell in with eleven other <lb/>
            vessels engaged in the same trade, whose crews, like their own, had resolved <lb/>
            on carrying off the relics of St. Nicholas. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This church, which is now deserted and used only as a burying place, <lb/>
            with the adjoining convent inhabited by a few caloyers, are all that remains <lb/>

            days. Finding there a ship from Venice, the crews began, <lb/>
            as people are wont, to inquire of each other for news. It <lb/>
            happened that among the men from Bari, there were some <lb/>
            friends and acquaintances of the Venetians, and they began <lb/>
            talking together about the body of the saint. The Venetians <lb/>
            made no reserve in disclosing their intentions, acknow­ <lb/>
            ledging that they were furnished with iron crowbars and <lb/>
            hammers ; and they hastened to take their dinner in order <lb/>
            that there might be no delay in carrying their purpose into <lb/>
            execution. The Barians, on learning this, were the more <lb/>
            resolved to engage in and complete the enterprise which <lb/>
            they likewise had determined on, not so much for their own <lb/>
            glory and honour, nor for the advantage of their country, <lb/>
            as for the love they bore to so eminent a confessor. They <lb/>
            therefore hastened to complete the business which had drawn <lb/>
            them to Antioch, and then, under God's guidance, set sail <lb/>
            on their return. But when they drew near the coast of <lb/>
            Myra with a favourable wind, their zeal flagged and they <lb/>
            would have sailed onward, had it not changed to the north <lb/>
            and become contrary by God's providence.1 The south wind <lb/>
            failing, the mariners of Bari were forced to come to anchor. <lb/>
            Learning from thence the Divine will, they immediately <lb/>
            seized their arms, and leaving a small party to guard the <lb/>
            ships in their absence, the rest,2 being well armed, and using <lb/>
            the same precautions as if they had to encounter an enemy, <lb/>
            proceeded in a body to the church, which stood about three <lb/>
            miles from the shore. At length they reached the enclosure <lb/>
            surrounding the church, and, laying down their arms, entered <lb/>
            the sacred building with deep humility, and began to <lb/>
            address their prayers to the holy bishop. Having finished <lb/>
            their devotions, they demanded of the sacristan where the. <lb/>
            body of St. Nicholas was deposited.3 Accordingly he <lb/>
            pointed out the spot, and drawing out a portion of the <note type="footnote"> 1 The wind being, at first, favourable for their homeward voyage to <lb/>
            Bar!, they were unwilling to lose the opportunity of prosecuting it, but <lb/>

            holy liquor, gave it to them. Thereupon, Lupus, a priest of <lb/>
            Bari, received the holy unguent in a glass bottle, and <lb/>
            deposited it on a high shelf for its safe preservation; but it <lb/>
            chanced that while they were conversing, the bottle fell on <lb/>
            the marble pavement, but was not broken, remaining unin­ <lb/>
            jured, to the wonder of all present. Meanwhile, the <lb/>
            Barians began to confer with three monks who remained <lb/>
            there to guard the relics, trying to seduce them from their <lb/>
            duty: "We wish," they said, " to bear off this holy body, <lb/>
            and transport it to our own country. We are come here in <lb/>
            three ships, commissioned by the pope of Rome to effect <lb/>
            this. If volt will consent to our doing it, we will give you <lb/>
            a hundred pieces of gold from each ship."</p>
          <p>On hearing this the monks were struck with surprise and <lb/>
            alarm, and replied: " How shall we dare to engage in an <lb/>
            enterprise which no human being has yet attempted with <lb/>
            impunity ? Who is there so audacious as to venture to be <lb/>
            either the buyer or seller in such a traffic ? What is there so <lb/>
            precious and so admirable as to be put in comparison with <lb/>
            so vast a treasure ?1 If the rulers of the earth have never <lb/>
            attempted such an enterprise rashly, however they may <lb/>
            have urged it with prayer and supplications, how can you <lb/>
            succeed ? Relinquish the further prosecution of this <lb/>
            impious design, for it is odious to the Divine Majesty. <lb/>
            But you may make the trial; behold the place!" They <lb/>
            said this, believing that it was impossible for the Barians to <lb/>
            effect their purpose; for it was nearly two hundred Olym­ <lb/>
            piads since the death of St. Nicholas,2 who is said to have <lb/>
            departed during the Nicene council held under Pope Sil­ <lb/>
            vester and the emperor Constantine, and hitherto no person <lb/>
            had been able either to purloin by stealth, or obtain by <lb/>
            open violence or by prayers to the Lord, any portion of his <lb/>
            relics. The men of Bari now began to be alarmed, for they <lb/>
            were in a strange place, they were few among many, the <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author's narrative abounds with accounts not only of the extreme <lb/>

            sun was near setting, and their return to the ships was <lb/>
            attended with danger. But, divinely supported, they first <lb/>
            seized the monks and kept them closely guarded, and also <lb/>
            sent out videttes with great caution, to observe all who <lb/>
            might approach the spot, while they stationed themselves in <lb/>
            arms at regular distances to guard the avenues. Thus, forty- <lb/>
            four1 young men, full of courage, were ready to make a <lb/>
            determined resistance without, while two priests, Lupus <lb/>
            and Grimoald, with a few others, were doing what was <lb/>
            necessary in the church, and began the prayers called lita­ <lb/>
            nies ; but they were in such a state of alarm that their <lb/>
            voices faltered in the service they had commenced.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Matthew, one of the mariners,2 manfully <lb/>
            seized an iron mallet, and striking violently the marble <lb/>
            pavement, shattered it, and discovered masonry under it, <lb/>
            which being broken up and thrown out, the face of a <lb/>
            marble urn quickly appeared. This discovery filled them <lb/>
            with joy and inspired them with ardour to dig still deeper, <lb/>
            so that, having rent asunder and reduced to fragments the <lb/>
            joints of the ancient masonry with a small pickaxe, they threw <lb/>
            out the rubbish in great haste. When this had been cleared <lb/>
            out and the urn3 was uncovered, one side of it being broken <lb/>
            an exquisite odour exuded which intoxicated all who were <lb/>
            present with its delicious fragrance. The young man then <lb/>
            inserting his hand only at first, the urn, which was of consider­ <lb/>
            able size, appeared to be full of liquor as far as the middle. <lb/>
            He then thrust in his right arm, and, feeling the invaluable <lb/>
            treasure which it was the object of his most ardent wishes <lb/>
            to secure, began fearlessly to extract it without loss of time. <lb/>
            At last in searching for the head, he plunged bodily into <lb/>
            the full urn, and groping about with his hands and feet <lb/>
            while endeavouring to find it, he came out with his whole <lb/>
            person and his garments dripping with the sacred liquid. <note type="footnote"> I The whole number of the armed crew mustered only forty-seven, and <lb/>
            from these must be deducted the two priests and the clerk, with the " few <lb/>

            This took place on the twelfth of the calends of May <lb/>
            [April 20th],' nearly eight hundred years after the death of <lb/>
            St. Nicholas.</p>
          <p>And now, as they were not prepared with any receptacle <lb/>
            for the relics, so sudden and unexpected was their success, <lb/>
            the Barians wrapped them as well as they could in the <lb/>
            vestment of Lupus,2 and followed him in procession as he <lb/>
            carried the holy burden. Thus they hastened to the sea­ <lb/>
            side, giving thanks to God for the inestimable prize which <lb/>
            they had snatched, not from an enemy's hands, but from <lb/>
            the treasury of the Lord. Some of them also carried away <lb/>
            the fragments of the broken urn, from which many altars <lb/>
            and tables were consecrated by the bishops in several parts <lb/>
            of Italy. When they reached the port, a contention arose <lb/>
            among the sailors as to which of the ships should bear the <lb/>
            precious freight, for all were desirous of securing the com­ <lb/>
            panionship of so powerful a patron. At last it was settled, <lb/>
            with general concurrence, that Matthew's ship should carry <lb/>
            the treasure, he first taking a solemn oath that he would <lb/>
            faithfully keep company with the rest; which was the case.</p>
          <p>Upon this, they embarked full of joy, and wrapping the <lb/>
            relics in an additional covering of new white cloth, they <lb/>
            enclosed them in a wooden vessel, such as sailors use for a <lb/>
            wine-cask.3 It is needless to describe the grief of the people <lb/>
            of Myra for the loss they had sustained, when they were <lb/>
            informed of what had happened. As soon as the report <lb/>
            reached their ears in the town, which stands on a hill not <lb/>
            more than a mile from the church,4 they flocked together in <note type="footnote"> I April 20, 1087. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The relics were wrapped in a white vestment belonging to Grimoald, <lb/>
            not Lupus; probably his alb or surplice. According to the narrative of <lb/>
            Nicephorus, the sailors attempted to carry off a picture of the saint which <lb/>
            stood upon the altar, but were unable to detach it. The white vestment <lb/>

            Are left to mourn our hapless fate.1</p>
          <p>While the Myrians, unable to avenge their grief, were <lb/>
            giving utterance to it in loud lamentations, the exulting <lb/>
            Barians quickly unmoored, and setting sail reached the <lb/>
            island of Cacabus' the same night, from whence they con­ <lb/>
            tinued their course to the Magestran islands.3 Here the <lb/>
            crew took to their oars in urgent haste, and reaching the <lb/>
            shores of Makry,4 were detained there three days by contrary <lb/>
            north winds. This caused them great uneasiness, and they <lb/>
            began to doubt their really having on board the relics of St. <lb/>
            Nicholas, or whether it was the. saint's pleasure to be <lb/>
            transported further by them. Then one of them, whose <lb/>
            name was Eustace,5 had his doubts removed by a dream, but <lb/>
            was terrified by seeing in the vision his tongue bloody with <lb/>
            the bites of leeches.</p>
          <p>In consequence all the crews, with general consent, <lb/>

            the middle ages; and that, considering it only as a religious romance, <lb/>
            the popular literature of those times was, as M. Guizot remarks in his <lb/>
            Histoire de la Civilisation, principally composed of such legends. The <lb/>
            present narrative, however, has an intrinsic value from the vividness with <lb/>

            sought anchorage there, the island of Kakava not offering it. From thence <lb/>
            they made Patara, the country of St. Nicholas, " come se avesse voluto <lb/>

            relics they had individually purloined, making solemn <lb/>
            asseverations that they retained no portion of what they <lb/>
            had thus appropriated. Romoald produced two teeth and <lb/>
            some small bones which he had concealed, and in like <lb/>
            manner all the rest surrendered the various particles they <lb/>
            had secretly taken, that they might be re-united with the <lb/>
            other parts of the saint's remains. After this, the adven­ <lb/>
            turers were favoured with a fair wind, and while their keels <lb/>
            were ploughing the wide sea, St. Nicholas appeared in a <lb/>
            dream to one of the sailors, Disigio by name, and gave him <lb/>
            the encouraging promise that they should enter the port of <lb/>
            Bari on the twentieth day after that on which they had <lb/>
            borne off his relics. The report of this vision to his ship­ <lb/>
            mates filled them with entire confidence.</p>
          <p>A little bird also was suddenly seen by the sailors flitting <lb/>
            about the ship, and inspired them with hope by its repeated <lb/>
            visits.1 They were also frequently sensible of a most fragrant <lb/>
            odour, and encouraged by other delightful indications of <lb/>
            the saint's presence, so that as they drew near to the shores <lb/>
            of their own country their spirits were raised to a high pitch <lb/>
            of joy and exultation.</p>
          <p>At length piloted by the providence of God, the mariners <lb/>
            moored their vessels in the port of St. George, distant some <lb/>
            five miles from the walls of Bari.2 Announcing their <lb/>
            arrival to the clergy and people of the place, the unexpected <lb/>
            news threw the whole city into a tumult of delight, and the <lb/>
            entire population of every age and both sexes flocked to the <lb/>

            at finding a place which is now only a roadstead, described as a port in the <lb/>
            middle ages. It is the natural consequence of the deposits made by the <lb/>

            Porto San Giorgio must not be mistaken for another anchorage, called <lb/>
            Torre di San Giorgio, on the same coast, two miles east of Monopoli. <lb/>

            monks placed it in their church on the ninth of the month <lb/>

          <p>At that time Ursa, archbishop of Bari,2 a pious prelate, <lb/>
            acceptable to God, and the intimate acquaintance and friend <lb/>
            of the Italian princes, was absent from his see. A ship <lb/>
            had been equipped and was ready for sea at Trani,3 and the <lb/>
            archbishop had determined to embark on the morrow with <lb/>
            the intention of undertaking a voyage to offer his devotions <lb/>
            at Jerusalen. He was, however, met at Trani by a <lb/>
            messenger with letters from the citizens of Bari informing <lb/>
            him of the intelligence which had filled them with joy. In <lb/>
            consequence Urso deferred his pilgrimage without hesitation, <lb/>
            and lost no time in returning to Bari, highly rejoicing. The <lb/>
            body was then transported by the townsmen to that city, the <lb/>
            solemnity of the translation being fixed for the seventh of <lb/>
            the ides [the 9th] of May. It was carried at first to the <lb/>
            palace of the Catapan,4 and there deposited, with great <lb/>
            reverence, at the request of the mariners and all the <lb/>
            citizens in the church of St. Stephen the proto-martyr, <lb/>

            were again entrusted to the care of abbot Elias, as well as the rich offerings <lb/>
            which devotion and gratitude soon poured in from all quarters. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The superintendence of the building a new church was also confided <lb/>
            to abbot Elias, and he pushed forward the work with such activity, that as <lb/>
            early as the 30th of September, 1089, Pope Urban II. was able to come and <lb/>
            consecrate the lower church and altar, where the relics of St. Nicholas were <lb/>
            deposited. Two days afterwards he ordained the pious abbot, who had <lb/>
            been his fellow scholar in the monastery of La Cava, as archbishop of Bari. <lb/>
            It was in this church that the same pope opened, on the Ist of October, <lb/>
            1099, the celebrated council in which were discussed the controverted points <lb/>
            between the Latin and Greek churches, and especially the procession of <lb/>
            the Holy Ghost. The distinguished part which Anselm, the Norman <lb/>
            archbishop of Canterbury, took in these weighty theological discussions, is <lb/>
            well known. It appears that the zeal with which the building the upper <lb/>
            church had been carried on was afterwards relaxed, for it was not until the <lb/>
            22nd of June, 1199, a century afterwards, that by delegation of Pope <lb/>

            Greeks, but other nations also give thanks to God for the <lb/>
            precious deposit. One Christopher, a knight, who had <lb/>
            assisted at the translation of the illustrious Nicholas, con­ <lb/>
            cealed one of the ribs in his sleeve, and not long afterwards <lb/>
            falling sick retired to the monastery of Venosa, imploring <lb/>
            the abbot Berenger to admit him as a monk. Having <lb/>
            obtained his request, he presented the rib of St. Nicholas <lb/>
            which he had in his possession to the abbey of the Holy <lb/>

            the silver from the holy relic and apply it for his support. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the report that the arm of St. Nicholas was <lb/>
            stolen by the French spread through the whole of Italy and <lb/>
            Sicily, and the robbery becoming the subject of frequent <lb/>
            conversation, and being much canvassed among the peo­ <lb/>
            ple, the silver covering was seen and recognized by some <lb/>
            of the inhabitants of Yenosa and servants of the convent. <lb/>
            The tidings thus reached the ears of the monks, whereupon <lb/>
            Erembert, an active brother, suddenly presented himself <lb/>
            with the servants before the ex-monk, who was lying sick, <lb/>
            and with great vehemence, demanded the arm of St. <lb/>
            Nicholas as if it had been expressly committed to his charge. <lb/>
            The sick, man, perceiving that he was detected, and not <lb/>
            knowing where to turn in his emergency, all pale and <lb/>
            trembling, produced the precious relic to the resolute monk, <lb/>
            who joyfully seizing it, carried it to the abbey of the Holy <lb/>
            Trinity, the monks and citizens returning thanks to God. <lb/>
            To this day, St. Nicholas there miraculously succours in <lb/>
            their several necessities those who faithfully implore his <lb/>
            aid in virtue of the sacred relic. This Erembert, a Norman <lb/>
            by birth, was before his conversion a brave soldier, and after­ <lb/>
            wards becoming a monk was a zealous member of his order.</p>
          <p>In these times a certain Norman knight, named William <lb/>
            Pantoul,1 betook himself to Apulia, and having a great <lb/>
            respect for St. Nicholas, made diligent inquiries after his <lb/>
            relics. By God's blessing on his endeavours he obtained <lb/>
            from those who had translated the body one tooth and two <lb/>
            fragments of the marble urn. William Pantoul was a <lb/>
            gallant soldier, endowed with great talents, and well known <note type="footnote"> 1 A further accunt of William Pantoul, or Pantulf, will be found in <lb/>

            among the nobles of England and Italy as one of the <lb/>
            wisest and richest among his neighbours. Having obtained <lb/>
            the tooth of so great a man, he returned to Normandy, and <lb/>
            on an appointed day called together a number of persons at <lb/>
            his own domain called Noron to receive the relics in a <lb/>
            worthy manner.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, in the year of our Lord 1092, the tooth of <lb/>
            the blessed confessor Nicholas, with other relics of the saints <lb/>
            brought by William Pantulf from Apulia, was deposited <lb/>
            with great reverence in the church of Noron erected in <lb/>
            ancient times in honour of St. Peter. He invited Roger, <lb/>
            abbot of St. Evroult and Ralph, who was at that time abbot <lb/>
            of Seez but who afterwards became archbishop of Canterbury,1 <lb/>
            to be present at the ceremony, and in the month of June <lb/>
            they received the holy relics amid great devotion of the <lb/>
            monks and rejoicings of the laity, carefully placing them in <lb/>
            a silver coffer liberally provided by the before mentioned <lb/>
            knight. The deposit so often spoken of became in frequent <lb/>
            request by persons suffering from fevers and other maladies, <lb/>
            whose devout prayers aided by the merits of the good <lb/>
            bishop Nicholas obtained what they desired in the recovery <lb/>
            of their health.</p>
          <p>Soon afterwards, this knight laid the foundation of a new <lb/>
            church, and having given twenty marks of silver for the <lb/>
            work, completed a considerable part of the building. <lb/>
            Unfortunately its progress was stopped by unfavourable <lb/>
            events, and in consequence of the founder's death it was <lb/>
            not finished. He died on the sixteenth of the calends of Mav <lb/>
            [16th April], and his wife Lesceline on the eleventh of the <lb/>
            calends of October [21st September] ; both were interred in <lb/>
            the monk's cloister. Their sons Philip, Robert, Ivo, and <lb/>
            Arnulph have not hitherto made any efforts to carry into <lb/>
            execution their parent's designs in matters of religion.2</p>

          <p>[1087.] The old funds between the Normans and French <lb/>
            being renewed, hostilities again burst forth, and the flames <lb/>
            of war occasioned the most serious losses both to the clergy <lb/>
            and laity. For Hugh, surnamed Stavel, and Ralph Malvoi­ <lb/>
            sin,1 and other inhabitants of the fortified town of Mantes <lb/>
            took up arms against King William, and collecting a large <lb/>
            band of freebooters made frequent predatory excursions into <lb/>
            Normandy. Crossing in the night, at the head of their <lb/>
            troops, the river Eure which divides Normandy from France,2 <lb/>
            they threw themselves unexpectedly on the diocese of Evreux. <lb/>
            determined on committing the most cruel devastations. The <lb/>
            brunt of the inroad fell on the domains of William de Breteuil <lb/>
            in the neighbourhood of Pad, and those of Roger de Ivri,3 <lb/>
            from which they drove off herds of cattle, and carried away <lb/>
            many prisoners, so that deriding the Normans, they were be­ <lb/>
            yondmeasure elated at their success. This induced the warlike <lb/>
            King William, who was excessively enraged, to lay claim to <lb/>
            the whole province of the Vexin, requiring Philip, king of <lb/>
            France, to surrender Pontoise, Chaumont,4 and :antes, and <lb/>

            restored to his lawful rights. The grounds of his claim were <lb/>
            as follows.</p>
          <p>King Henry, son of Robert king of France, after the death <lb/>
            of his father, was heir to the crown as his eldest son, but he <lb/>
            was opposed with a step-mother's hatred by Queen Constance <lb/>
            who used every effort to elevate his brother, Robert duke of <lb/>
            Burgundy, to the throne of France in his place. Henry <lb/>
            therefore, by the advice of Amauri, lord of Montfort, son of <lb/>
            William de Hainault, came with twelve attendants to <lb/>
            Fécamp,1 and humbly besought the assistance of Robert <lb/>
            duke of Normandy, in the state of misery and exile to which <lb/>
            his mother's perfidy had reduced him. The duke gave him <lb/>
            an honourable reception befitting his lawful right as suzerain <lb/>
            of the duchy, and liberally entertained him during the <lb/>
            celebration of the feast of Easter. He then assembled the <lb/>
            forces of Normandy from every quarter, and making a hasty <lb/>
            irruption into France, assaulted Orleans with Norman <lb/>
            impetuosity and set fire to and burnt the place. Having <lb/>
            lowered the pride of the French by inflicting on them <lb/>
            immense losses, Robert restored the young king to his throne. <lb/>
            Thus reinstated, King Henry returned thanks to the duke, <lb/>
            and for his service ceded to him the whole of the Vexin from <lb/>
            the river Oise to the Epte. Dreux, the count of that pro­ <lb/>
            vince,2 assented willingly to this arrangement, and doing <lb/>
            homage to the duke served him faithfully as long as he lived.3 <lb/>
            Both the duke and the count were distinguished for their <lb/>
            merits, their regard was mutual, and each delighted to <lb/>
            honour the other and advance his friend's interests.</p>
          <p>Dreux, as I have before remarked, was descended from <lb/>
            Charlemagne, king of the Franks.4 Duke Robert had given <lb/>
            him in marriage his cousin Goda,5 sister of Edward, king of <lb/>
            England, by whom he had the Counts Ralph and Walter, and <lb/>
            the venerable Fulk, bishop of Amiens.6 The young princess <note type="footnote"> 1 This journey of Henry I. to Fécamp was undertaken in the month o <lb/>

            had become an exile in Normandy with her brother, at the <lb/>
            time when Canute, king of Denmark had taken forcible <lb/>
            possession of England, having expelled the two heirs to the <lb/>
            crown, Alfred and Edward, and cut off by the treason of <lb/>
            Edric Prince Edmund, and Edwin, the presumptive heir.1</p>
          <p>After some years, on the death of Duke Robert at Nice, a <lb/>
            city of Bithynia, the Norman barons revolted against <lb/>
            William, who was then a boy; for when his father set out <lb/>
            on his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in company with Count <lb/>
            Dreux, William was only eight years old,2 and was entrusted <lb/>
            to the guardianship of his cousin Alan, count of Brittany.3 <lb/>
            Robert and Dreux dying on their journey, and Alan being <lb/>
            carried off by poison treacherously administered by the <lb/>
            Normans while he was besieging Montgomery, their heirs <lb/>
            became iniquitously deprived of their natural protector, so <lb/>
            that King Henry, by the advice of the French who are <lb/>
            always at variance with the. Normans, was able to take <lb/>
            advantage of it, and re-annex the country of the Vexin, <lb/>
            which he afterwards retained in his own power. William <lb/>
            was at that time prevented from asserting his rights, on <lb/>
            account of his youth; and afterwards being occupied with <lb/>
            more important affairs in Maine and England, he suffered the <lb/>
            matter to drop, and deferred taking up arms for the recovery <lb/>
            of the Vexin against Philip, his liege-lord, or his son Philip.</p>
          <p>At length, twenty-one years after he had ascended the <lb/>
            throne of England, William addressed his claims to the <lb/>
            county of the Vexin to Philip, king of France. That prince <lb/>
            however adopted the frivolous subterfuges suggested by the <lb/>
            insurgents, and treated with contempt, and altogether dis­ <lb/>
            regarded, the demands of the English king. Upon this, <lb/>
            William made his appearance suddenly before Mantes, at <lb/>
            the head of an army, in the last week of the month of July,4 <lb/>
            and his troops entered the city mixed with the garrison. <lb/>

            devastations which Ascelin Goel' had made with the Norman <lb/>
            troops the day before the king's arrival, by burning the <lb/>
            standing corn, and rooting up the vines. The royal army <lb/>
            thus rushing in pell-mell with the garrison, passed the gates, <lb/>
            and in their fury set fire to the castle, which was burnt, with <lb/>
            the churches and houses.2 It was there that King William, <lb/>
            who was very corpulent, fell sick from the excessive heat and <lb/>
            his great fatigues,3 languishing six weeks with severe <lb/>
            sufferings. There were some who rejoiced at this calamity, <lb/>
            hoping to have free scope for pillage and robbing their <lb/>
            neighbours' substance, others, who looked for security in <lb/>
            peace, greatly feared the death of their lord, on whom it <lb/>
            depended. The king, who during his whole life had followed <lb/>
            the advice of wise counsellors, had feared God as became his <lb/>
            faithful servant, and had been the unwearied protector of <lb/>
            holy mother church, maintained his exalted reputation to the <lb/>
            end. His death was worthy of his life. To the very last, <lb/>
            through all his illness, his intellect was clear and his <lb/>
            conversation lively; repenting of his sins he confessed them <lb/>
            to the priests of God, and humbly strove to appease his <lb/>
            wrath according to the rites of the Christian church. The <lb/>
            bishops, abbots, and men of religion never left him, and were <lb/>
            indefatigable in opening to the dying prince the salutary <lb/>
            doctrines of eternal life. The noise of Rouen, which is a <lb/>
            populous place, becoming insupportable to the sufferer, the <lb/>
            king gave orders that he should be conveyed out of the city <lb/>
            to the church of St. Gervase, standing on a hill to the west: <note type="footnote"> 1 For Ascelin Goël, lord of Breval, see before, p. 237. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Conqueror was severely reproached for having set fire to this <lb/>
            place, and even burnt the churches, and it appears to have weighed on his <lb/>
            conscience in his last hours. But the circumstance which most roused the <lb/>
            public indignation, was the cruel death of two nuns (Malmsbury says one <lb/>
            only), " who did not think it justifiable to quit their cells even under such <lb/>

            monastery of Fécamp. There, Gilbert, bishop of Lisieux,1 <lb/>
            and Guntard, abbot of Jumièges,2 with some others, well <lb/>
            skilled in medicine, carefully watched over him, devoting <lb/>
            themselves zealously to their master's welfare, both spiritual <lb/>
            and temporal.</p>
          <p>At length, his disorder continually increasing, and <lb/>
            perceiving that inevitable death was becoming imminent, he <lb/>
            became anxious about the future, which was veiled from his <lb/>
            sight, reflecting on which with deep concern, he was <lb/>
            frequently moved to sighs and groans. He summoned to his <lb/>
            side his sons William Rufus and Henry, who were in <lb/>
            attendance on him with some of his friends, and gave them <lb/>
            many wise and prudent directions for the regulation of his <lb/>
            states. Robert, his eldest son, had long since entered on a <lb/>
            course of repeated quarrels with his father, and had recently <lb/>
            taken umbrage in consequence of some new follies, and <lb/>
            retired to the court of the king of France.</p>
          <p>The wise king hastened to make provision for the future <lb/>
            welfare of himself and others, ordering all his treasures to be <lb/>
            distributed among the churches, the poor, and the ministers <lb/>
            of God. He exactly specified the amount to be given to <lb/>
            each, and gave directions to the notaries to reduce it to <lb/>
            writing in his own presence. He also contritely sent large <lb/>
            donations to the clergy of Mantes, to be applied to the <lb/>
            restoration of the churches he had burnt. He gave <lb/>
            admonitions to all who were present relative to the <lb/>
            maintenance of justice and good faith, keeping the law of <lb/>
            God and peace, the privileges of the churches, and observing <lb/>
            the rules of the fathers. His eloquent discourse, worthy to <lb/>
            be held in everlasting remembrance, and at times interrupted <lb/>
            by tears, was to the following effect. <note type="footnote"> Victrix, it is believed, having obtained some relics of St. Gervase and St. <lb/>
            Proteus (discovered by St. Ambrose in 38G), placed this church under <lb/>
            their invocation. It is at least certain that the crypt is the most ancient <lb/>
            Christian monument in Normandy. Roman bricks are built into the wall. <lb/>

          <p>" I tremble," he said, " my friends, when I reflect on the <lb/>
            grievous sins which burden my conscience, and now about <lb/>
            to be summoned before the awful tribunal of God, I know <lb/>
            not what I ought to do. I was bred to arms from my child­ <lb/>
            hood, and am stained with the rivers of blood I have shed. <lb/>
            It is out of my power to enumerate all the injuries which I <lb/>
            have caused during the sixty-four1 years of my troublesome <lb/>
            life, for which I am now called to render account without <lb/>
            delay to the most righteous Judge. At the time my father <lb/>
            went into voluntary exile, entrusting to me the duchy of <lb/>
            Normandy, I was a mere youth of the age of eight years, <lb/>
            and from that time to this I have always borne the weight <lb/>
            of arms. I have now ruled this duchy fifty-six years,2 <lb/>
            amidst the difficulties of incessant wars. My own subjects <lb/>
            have often conspired against me, and shamefully exposed me <lb/>
            to serious losses and great injuries. They have perfidiously <lb/>
            put to death Turketil my guardian,3 Osberne, son of Hirfast,4 <lb/>
            steward of Normandy; Count Gilbert, the father of his <lb/>
            country,5 and many others, who were the pillars of the state. <lb/>
            In these trials I had proof of the fidelity of my people : <lb/>
            often by night I was secretly taken from the chamber of <lb/>
            my palace by my uncle Walter,6 through fear of my own <note type="footnote"> 1 This reckoning is inexact, as is shown in a former note, p. 400. <lb/>
            Indeed, William just afterwards corrects it himself, saying that he was only <lb/>
            eight years old in 1035. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For 56 read 52. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Turketil du Neuf-Marché, son of Geoffry du Neuf-Marché. See <lb/>

            was killed at the same time, see ib. p. 267. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Osberne de Crépon, surnamed the Pacific, son of Hirfast, and brother <lb/>

            eldest son of Roger 1. de Montgomery. Barnon de Glos, Osborne's <lb/>
            steward, avenged his lord's death by surrounding and setting on fire the <lb/>
            house in which the assassin and his accomplices were. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 William speaks too favourably of Count Gilbert, for notwithstanding <lb/>
            the odious circumstances which attended his death, he received only the <lb/>

            sought my death.</p>
          <p>" The Normans, when under the rule of a kind but firm <lb/>
            master, are a most valiant people, excelling all others in the <lb/>
            invincible courage with which they meet difficulties, and <lb/>
            . strive to conquer every enemy. But under other circum­ <lb/>
            stances they rend in pieces and ruin each other. They are <lb/>
            eager for rebellion, ripe for tumults, and ready for every <lb/>
            sort of crime. They must therefore be restrained by the <lb/>
            strong hand of justice, and compelled to walk in the right <lb/>
            way by the reins of discipline. But if they are allowed to <lb/>
            take their own course without any yoke and like an un­ <lb/>
            tamed colt, they and their princes will be overwhelmed with <lb/>
            poverty, shame, and confusion. I have learnt this by <lb/>
            much experience. My nearest friends, my own kindred, <lb/>
            who ought to have defended me at all hazards against the <lb/>
            whole world, have formed conspiracies, and rebelling against <lb/>
            me, nearly stripped me of the inheritance of my fathers.</p>
          <p>" Guy, son of Reynold, duke of Burgundy,1 by my aunt <lb/>
            Adeliza, returned me evil for good. I had kindly received <lb/>
            him on his arrival from a foreign country, and treated him <lb/>
            with the regard due to an only brother, giving him Vernon, <lb/>
            Brionne,2 and an important part of my Norman territories. <lb/>
            Notwithstanding this, he did all in his power to injure me, <lb/>
            both by word and deed, calling me bastard, degenerate and <lb/>
            unworthy to reign, and defaming me as if I had been his <lb/>
            enemy. Need I add more ? Breaking his fealty, he rebelled <lb/>
            against me, seduced from my service Ranulf de Bayeux,3 <lb/>
            Haymon-aux-Dents,4 Nigel du Cotentin,5 and many others, <lb/>
            forcing them by his nefarious counsels to be partakers of <lb/>
            his perjury. Regardless therefore of the homage and fealty <lb/>
            which he had sworn to me, he strove to strip me of the <lb/>
            whole of Normandy. Thus, while I was yet a beardless <note type="footnote"> 1 Guy, second son of Reynold, count (not duke) of Burgundy, 1027— <lb/>

            youth, I found myself compelled to take up arms against <lb/>
            him, and to fight on the plain of Val-des-Dunes' against my <lb/>
            cousin and liege man. Then, by the help of God,2 the <lb/>
            righteous judge, I conquered my foes between Caen and <lb/>
            Argences,3 and having by His permission utterly defeated <lb/>
            them, I obtained entire possession of my paternal rights. I <lb/>
            then laid siege to the fortress of Brionne, in which Guy, <lb/>
            who fled wounded from the field of battle, had shut himself <lb/>
            up, and I did not depart until I had driven the public <lb/>
            enemy out of Normandy, and obtained possession of all his <lb/>
            strong holds.'</p>
          <p>“Shortly afterwards a still more grievous calamity befell <lb/>
            me. My uncles, Mauger,5 archbishop of Rouen, and his <lb/>
            brother William,6 to whom I had gratuitously given Arques <lb/>
            and the county of Talou, treated me with contempt as a <lb/>
            bastard, and induced King Henry and Engelran, count of <lb/>
            Penthieu, to take up arms against me. I received this in- <note type="footnote"> 1 The battle of Val-ès-Dunes, fought in 1047. This name, of which the <lb/>

            of Bellengreville, in the neighbourhood of Caen. See also the note, vol. i. <lb/>
            p. 151. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 William appears to have forgotten that he obtained this victory not <lb/>
            only by God's help, but by the powerful assistence of Henry, king of <lb/>

            the details of this battle, Wace (t. ii. pp. 27—43), who gives them with <lb/>
            great care and knowledge of the localities. The king of France, who <lb/>
            marched by way of Valmerai, made a circuit round the valley of the river <lb/>
            Semillon, instead of traversing it as William did. The Val-ès-Dunes, <lb/>
            surrounded by the river to the south and south-west, is situated in the <lb/>
            parishes of Chichebovelle and Bellengreville. </note><note type="footnote"> * We shall see presently that Guy was blockaded in his castle of <lb/>

            considered as the founder of the castle, and he was the fiist who substituted <lb/>
            the title of Arques for that of Talou. Engelran, count -of Ponthieu, was <lb/>

            my march contrary to the opinions of most of my advisers. <lb/>
            Sending forward to Arques some light troops who were <lb/>
            eager for the fray, I followed myself2 with the main body, <lb/>
            which was far from considerable, to lay siege to the castle. <lb/>
            But before 1 reached the country between the two rivers, <lb/>
            the Sie and the Garenne, the advanced guard fell in with <lb/>
            Count Engelran pushing forward to occupy the fortress, and <lb/>
            killed him, fighting bravely, for he was a valiant knight, and <lb/>
            routed his squadrons. Pressing the siege closely, I com­ <lb/>
            pelled the perjured count to go into banishment, and did <lb/>
            not permit him to return to the domains he lost during all <lb/>
            the days of his life.3 I also, by virtue of a papal decree, de­ <lb/>
            posed the insolent archbishop, who neither observed his <lb/>
            fealty to me, nor his duty to God, and raised to the see the <lb/>
            venerable monk Maurilius who was providentially sent from <lb/>
            Florence, an Italian city.4</p>
          <p>" Henry, in all the plenitude of his royal power and the <lb/>
            fervour of his chivalrous spirit, has been often seen at the <lb/>
            instigation of my enemies, to trample me under his feet as a <lb/>
            defenceless man, endeavouring to crush me and impose upon <lb/>
            me unjust conditions. He has made frequent irruptions <lb/>
            into my territories at the head of large armies, but he has <lb/>
            never been able to triumph in the spoils and booty he has <lb/>
            gained, or the captives he has made among my subjects. He <lb/>
            has often crossed the frontiers with great military pomp, <lb/>
            and terrible menaces, but he has never returned to his own <lb/>
            kingdom without sorrow and shame. He has brought in <lb/>
            his train numbers of most valiant men, who, alas ! never <lb/>
            saw their own country again, having fallen by my sword and <lb/>
            the arms of my followers. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Cotentin was the name given to a district in the extreme north- <lb/>

          <p>" On one occasion, King Henry, was so enraged against <lb/>
            me, that he invaded my territories with a vast army in two <lb/>
            divisions, in order to overwhelm them by a double attack.' <lb/>
            He led one body of troops himself into the diocese of Evreux, <lb/>
            and ravaged the whole country on this side the Seine, while <lb/>
            he gave the command of the other division to his brother <lb/>
            Eudes,2 with Reynold de Clermont, and the two counts, <lb/>
            Ralph de Montdidier,3 and Guy de Ponthieu,4, with orders to <lb/>
            enter Normandy by the fords of the Epte,5 and, carrying fire <lb/>
            and sword through Brai and the Talois, with the whole dis­ <lb/>

            part of the Vexin, after the death of his cousin Walter in 1063. See <lb/>
            before, p. 79. He never bore the title of Comte de Montdidier given him <lb/>
            by our author, and only possessed that place by depriving his cousin- <lb/>
            german, Rothaïs daughter and heiress of Eudes, comte de Montdidier of <lb/>
            it. Having married twice, he divorced his second wife to marry the queen, <lb/>
            Anne of Russia, widow of Henry I. Faithful to his habits of violence <lb/>
            and usurpation, towards the close of his life (about 1071 or 1072) he seized <lb/>
            the castle of Péronne, of which exploit he was so proud that he afterwards <lb/>
            used no other title but that of Ralph de Péronne. He died at Montdidier, <lb/>
            Sept. 3, 1074, under excommunication for his divorce, and was buried in <lb/>
            the priory of Notre-Dame in that town. </note><note type="footnote"> Simon de Crépi, his son and successor, led a life as pure and holy as <lb/>
            that of Ralph had been violent and criminal. One of his first cares was <lb/>
            to restore Montdidier to the right heirs, and to disinter his father's body, <lb/>
            and have it conveyed to his own patrimony at Crépi. This exhumation <lb/>
            was made on March 22, 1076. Simon, who was present, was so shocked <lb/>
            at the appearance of his father's corpse, that it was a new motive for his <lb/>
            quitting the world and devoting himself to a monastic life, which he <lb/>
            shortly afterwards did, although his friends, to withdraw him from it, <lb/>
            brought about his marriage with Judith, daughter of Robert Comte <lb/>
            d'Auvergne. The new married pair made vows of chastity on the day of <lb/>
            their union, and both embraced a religious life. Simon was one of the <lb/>

            coast. Receiving intelligence of these movements, I lost no <lb/>

            part of my troops along the bank of the Seine against the <lb/>
            king's tents, I kept him in check, and was ready to fall upon <lb/>
            the enemy at whatever point he attempted to ravage my <lb/>
            territories. Meanwhile, I detached against Eudes and his <lb/>
            division Robert, Count d'Eu, with Roger de Mortemer,1 and <lb/>
            other distinguished knights; who, encountering the French <lb/>
            near the castle of Mortemer, the line of battle was formed by <lb/>
            both armies, and a desperate engagement ensued, in which the <lb/>
            carnage was enormous, for the combatants on both sides were <lb/>
            full of ardour and resolved not to yield but with their lives. On <lb/>
            one side, the French made furious assaults, inspired by the <lb/>
            hope of gaining the spoils of the victory ; on the other, the <lb/>
            Normans struck home, animated by their determination to <lb/>
            repel the enemy and defend their lives and possessions. <lb/>
            This battle was fought beyond the Seine in the winter <lb/>
            season, before Lent, eight years after that of Val-des-Dunes.2 <lb/>
            Guy, count of Ponthieu, was taken prisoner and ElIdes, <lb/>
            Reynold, and others were put to flight, owing their escape <lb/>
            to the speed with which they ran away. Count Ralph [de <lb/>
            Valois] would also have been taken, if Roger, my corn­ <lb/>
            mander-in-chief, had not favoured his escape on account of <lb/>
            the fealty he had formerly sworn to him. In acting thus, <lb/>
            in the hour of the count's utmost need, he paid him a noble <lb/>
            and legitimate service; receiving him in his castle, where he <lb/>
            entertained him three days, and afterwards conducting him <lb/>
            in safety to his own territories. Notwithstanding, for this <lb/>
            breach of his duty to me, I banished Robert from Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, but, being soon afterwards reconciled with him, <lb/>
            restored him all his domains, except the castle of Mortemer, <lb/>
            in which he had sheltered my enemy ; which I think he <lb/>
            justly forfeited, and I granted it to his cousin William de <lb/>

            his commission. According to Robert Wace, he climbed up into a tree, <lb/>
            but Ralph de Diceto says he stood on a hillock : " It was night when, <lb/>
            standing on a neighbouring hill, he began to shout aloud, ' My name is <lb/>

            have run away. The duke of Normandy sends this message to the king of <lb/>

            reached him in the dead of the night, King Henry lost not <lb/>
            a moment in putting his troops in motion, and, having made <lb/>
            a precipitate retreat, from that hour he has never reposed <lb/>
            for a single night on my territories.</p>
          <p>" Thus, from my very infancy, I have been continually <lb/>
            involved in numberless embarassments, but, by God's mercy, <lb/>
            I have freed myself from them all with the highest honour. <lb/>
            I became in consequence an object of jealousy to all my <lb/>
            neighbours, but by His aid in whom I always put my trust, <lb/>
            none of them were able to prevail against me. The Bretons <lb/>
            and Anjevins have found this ; the French and Flemings <lb/>

            engaged in perfidious enterprises against me; but as God <lb/>
            was my protector, though they made great efforts and laid <lb/>
            many snares for me, they were never able to accomplish <lb/>
            their designs. I have placed on my brow a royal diadem, <lb/>
            which none of my predecessors wore, having acquired it by <lb/>
            the grace of God, not by hereditary right. It would be dif­ <lb/>

            perilous conflicts in which I have been engaged with the <lb/>
            people of Exeter, Chester, and Northumbria, with the Scots <lb/>
            and Welsh, Norwegians, Danes, and other adversaries who <lb/>
            attempted to deprive me of the crown of England: in all <lb/>
            which I obtained the victory. But much as human ambition <lb/>

            prayers to Almighty God for the forgiveness of the sins <lb/>
            with which my conscience is burdened, and that through <lb/>
            his inexhaustible mercy he will vouchsafe to grant me salva­ <lb/>

            the churches and the poor, that what was amassed in crime <lb/>
            may be dispersed among the saints and applied to holy <lb/>
            uses. For you ought to remember how dearly I have loved <lb/>
            you, and how stoutly I have defended you against all your <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>" I have never injured the church of God, which is our <lb/>
            mother, but have always paid her, as circumstances demanded, <lb/>
            due honour. I never sold ecclesiastical dignities. I pro­ <lb/>
            hibited simony, which I always detested. In the election of <lb/>
            prelates my choice was directed by meritorious conduct and <lb/>
            wise doctrine, and as far as it has been in my power the <lb/>
            government of the church has been committed to the most <lb/>
            worthy. This may be truly proved by my selection of Lan­ <lb/>
            franc, archbishop of Canterbury; of Anselm, abbot of Bee; <lb/>
            Gerbert, abbot of Fontenelles; Durand, of Troarn; and <lb/>
            many other doctors of my realm, whose praise, I think, is <lb/>
            spread to the ends of the earth. Such were the associates <lb/>
            with whom I conversed, and in whose society I learnt the <lb/>
            maxims of wisdom and truth; so that I always delighted to <lb/>
            receive their counsels.</p>
          <p>" Nine abbeys of monks and one of nuns, founded in <lb/>

            them. Moreover, during the time I have governed the <lb/>

            is well protected, and in them men are taught to combat the <lb/>
            demons and the sins of the flesh. By God's inspiration all <lb/>
            these abbeys have been either of my creation or foundation, <lb/>
            and I became their zealous benefactor and kind promoter. <lb/>
            Moreover, all the endowments, whether in lands or other <lb/>
            revenues, which my barons have given to God and his saints, <lb/>
            for the good of their souls, both in Normandy and England, <lb/>
            I have graciously confirmed, and have gratuitously ratified <lb/>
            by my princely authority the charters granting them, against <lb/>
            all claims and pretensions.</p>
          <p>" Such have been my cares from my earliest years, and <lb/>
            these duties I leave to my successors to be observed in all <lb/>
            time to come. In these, my sons, constantly follow my <lb/>
            example, that you may be honoured for ever before God <lb/>
            and men. I especially exhort you, who are my own flesh, <lb/>
            to cultivate unceasingly the society of good and wise men, <lb/>
            and to submit to their rule in all things, if you desire to <lb/>
            possess durable glory. From the teaching of pious philoso­ <lb/>
            phers you will learn to discern good from evil, to adhere to <lb/>
            justice on all occasions, and to spare no pains in avoiding <lb/>
            iniquity; to be merciful protectors of the weak, the poor, <lb/>
            and the pious, while you bridle and put down the proud and <lb/>
            malicious: to refrain from injuring simple folk, to frequent <lb/>
            with devotion the services of holy church, to love the wor­ <lb/>
            ship of God above all riches, and to observe unweariedly <lb/>
            the divine law by day and by night, in prosperity and in <lb/>
            adversity.</p>
          <p>" I granted the dukedom of Normandy to my son Robert, <lb/>
            because he was the eldest,' before I fought against Harold <lb/>
            on the heath2 of Senlac. He has already received the <lb/>
            homage of nearly all the barons of this land. The grant <lb/>
            thus made and ratified I cannot annul. But I know for <lb/>
            certain that the country which is subject to his dominion <lb/>
            will be truly wretched. He is a proud and silly prodigal, <lb/>
            and will have long to suffer severe misfortune. <note type="footnote"> 1 It has been already remarked that the nomination of Robert to <lb/>

            I have persecuted its native inhabitants beyond all reason. <lb/>
            Whether nobles or commons, I have cruelly oppressed <lb/>

            Sweyn, king of Denmark, as their auxiliaries against me, <lb/>
            and put to the sword Robert Comyn and a thousand soldiers <lb/>
            within the walls of Durham, as well as others, my barons <lb/>
            and most esteemed knights, in various places.2 These events <lb/>
            inflamed me to the highest pitch of resentment, and I fell <lb/>
            on the English of the northern counties like a raving lion. <lb/>
            I commanded their houses and corn, with all their imple­ <lb/>
            ments and furniture, to be burnt without distinction, and <lb/>
            large herds of cattle and beasts of burden, to be butchered <lb/>
            wherever they were found. It was thus that I took revenge <lb/>
            on multitudes of both sexes by subjecting them to the <lb/>
            calamity of a cruel famine; and by so doing, alas me! <lb/>
            became the barbarous murderer of many thousands, both <lb/>

            the same effect, and the bystanders who cautiously scanned <lb/>
            the dim prospects of the future, were lost in amazement, <lb/>
            Henry, his youngest son, hearing that no provision was <lb/>
            made for him out of the royal wealth, said sorrowfully to the <lb/>
            king: "And what, my father, do you give me?" to which <lb/>
            the king replied: " I bequeath to you five thousand pounds <lb/>
            of silver from my treasury." Upon which Henry said: <lb/>
            " What shall I do with this money, having no corner of <lb/>
            earth which I can call my own?" To which the king <lb/>
            answered: " My son, be contented with your lot, and trust <lb/>
            in the Lord. Suffer patiently your elder brothers to precede <lb/>
            you. Robert will have Normandy, and William England. <lb/>
            But you, also, in your turn, will succeed to all the dominions <lb/>
            which belong to me, and you will surpass your brothers in <lb/>
            wealth and power." After he had said this, the king, <lb/>
            fearing lest in such extended territories some sudden tumults <lb/>
            might burst forth, addressed a letter to Lanfranc the arch­ <lb/>
            bishop, on the appointment of a successor to the throne, and <lb/>
            affixing his seal, gave it to his son William Rufus, coin­ <lb/>
            manding him to embark for England without delay. He <lb/>
            then kissed him, and, giving him his blessing, directed him <lb/>
            to hasten his departure and cross the sea to secure the <lb/>
            crown. The prince lost no time in riding to the port of <lb/>
            Wissant,1 and there he received intelligence of his father's <lb/>
            death. Henry was equally prompt in securing the money <lb/>
            allotted to him. He had it carefully weighed that there <lb/>
            might be no deficiency, and, summoning his intimate friends <lb/>

            of the dying prince, together with the nobles who had come <lb/>
            to visit him, took an opportunity of speaking in favour of <lb/>
            the captives who were detained in prison, humbly entreating <lb/>
            him to have pity on them and grant their release. The king <lb/>
            replied to them: " I have long kept in captivity Morcar, <lb/>
            the noble English earl; in this I have been unjust, but my <lb/>
            fear has been that if he were liberated he would raise <lb/>
            disturbances in the kingdom of England.1 I threw into <lb/>
            prison Roger de Breteuil2 who opposed me with bitter <lb/>
            animosity, and stirred up against me his brother-in-law <lb/>
            Ralph de Guader and many others, and I swore that he <lb/>

            of death, as I hope to be saved and, by God's mercy, <lb/>
            absolved from my sins, I order that the prison doors shall <lb/>
            be forthwith thrown open, and all the prisoners, except mv <lb/>
            brother, the bishop of Bayeux, be released and suffered to <lb/>
            go free, for the love of God, that He also may have mercy <lb/>
            on me. But they are not to be liberated, but on condition <lb/>
            that they first take an oath to my ministers, for the security <lb/>
            of the state, that they will use every means to preserve <lb/>
            the peace both in Normandy and in England, and will <lb/>
            stedfastly resist the enemies of tranquillity to the utmost of <lb/>
            their power.”</p>
          <p>When Robert, earl of Morton, heard that by the king's <lb/>
            decision his brother was condemned to perpetual imprison­ <lb/>
            ment he was much distressed. Herluin de Conteville4 had <lb/>
            married Harleve, the concubine of Duke Robert, by whom <lb/>
            he had two sons. Odo and Robert. William, who was first <lb/>
            duke and afterwards king, had heaped honours and posses­ <lb/>
            sions on his father-in-law both in Normandy and England, <lb/>
            and had enriched with large domains his sons, Ralph, born <note type="footnote"> 1 See before, b. iv. c. 7, p. 45. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See ib. p. 82. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 We are not able to discover any passage of this kind in the Penta. <lb/>

            of another wife,1 and Robert and Odo, his own uterine <lb/>
            brothers. For having expelled from Normandy on slight <lb/>
            pretences William, surnamed Werlenge, count of Morton, <lb/>
            son of Count Mauger,2 he had conferred the county of Mor­ <lb/>
            ton on Robert, son of Herluin, and thus his own brother. <lb/>
            Moreover, on the death of Hugh, bishop of Bayeux, son <lb/>
            of Count Mauger,3 he gave that bishopric to his brother <lb/>
            Odo, whom he afterwards made earl of Kent in England. <lb/>
            At length, King William arrested him in the Isle of <lb/>
            Wight,4 on account of his overweening pride, as I have <lb/>
            before fully related, and having detained him four years in <lb/>
            prison, was unwilling, such was the insolence of Odo, to <lb/>
            release him even when he was himself at the point of death. <lb/>
            In consequence, the earl of Morton, of whom I have lately <lb/>
            spoken, was sorely afflicted, and, by his own supplications <lb/>
            and those of his friends on behalf of his brother, wearied <lb/>
            the suffering prince.</p>
          <p>The king was exhausted by the numerous solicitations <lb/>
            from so many quarters for the release of the bishop of <lb/>
            Bayeux; but at length he said: " I wonder that your <lb/>
            penetration has not discovered the character of the man for <lb/>
            whom you supplicate me. Are not you making petitions for <lb/>
            a prelate who has long held religion in contempt, and who is <lb/>
            the subtle promoter of fatal divisions ? Have I not already <lb/>
            incarcerated for four years this bishop, who when he ought <lb/>
            to have proved himself exemplary in the just government <lb/>
            of England, became a most cruel oppressor of the people, <lb/>
            and destroyer of the convents of monks? In desiring the <lb/>
            liberation of this seditious man, you are ill-advised, and are <lb/>
            bringing on yourselves a serious calamity. It is clear that <lb/>
            my brother Odo is a man not to be trusted, ambitious, <lb/>
            given to fleshly desires, and of enormous cruelty ; and that <lb/>
            he will never be converted from his whoredoms and ruinous <lb/>
            follies. I satisfied myself of this on several occasions, and <lb/>
            therefore I imprisoned, not the bishop, but the tyrannical <note type="footnote"> 1 This is the only notice we have of this eldest son of Herluin de Con­ <lb/>

            earl. There is no doubt that if he is released, he will <lb/>
            disturb the whole country and be the ruin of thousands. I <lb/>
            say this not from hatred, as if I were his enemy, but as the <lb/>
            father of my country, watching for the welfare of a Christian <lb/>
            people. It would indeed give me inexpressible and heart- <lb/>
            felt joy to think that he would conduct himself with chastity <lb/>
            and moderation, as it always becomes a priest and minister <lb/>
            of God.”1</p>
          <p>All the friends of the bishop pledging themselves for his <lb/>
            reformation, the king further said: " Whether I will or <lb/>
            not, your petition shall be granted, but after my death there <lb/>
            will immediately be a violent change in affairs. It is <lb/>
            against my own judgment that I permit my brother to be <lb/>
            liberated from confinement, for be assured that he will <lb/>
            cause the death or the grievous injury of many persons. Fur­ <lb/>
            ther, as I have declared the forfeiture of all the lands of <lb/>
            Baudri, son of Nicholas,2 as a punishment for his folly in <lb/>
            quitting my service and going to Spain without my licence, <lb/>
            I now restore him his domains for the love of God. I do <lb/>
            not think that a braver knight exists, but he is prodigal and <lb/>
            inconstant, and loves to wander in foreign countries."</p>
          <p>Thus King William, though tormented with excruciating <lb/>
            pains in his intestines, preserved throughout the full pos­ <lb/>
            session of his clearness of intellect and power of expressing <lb/>
            himself with his usual vivacity; and gave with readiness <lb/>
            useful counsels to all who addressed themselves to him on <lb/>
            the affairs of the state.</p>
          <p>At length, on Tuesday, the fifth of the ides [the 9th] of <lb/>

            great bell of the cathedral of Rouen. On his inquiring <lb/>
            what it meant, his attendants replied: " My Lord, the bell <lb/>
            is tolling for primes in the church of St. Mary.” Then the <lb/>
            king, raised his eyes to heaven with deep devotion, and <lb/>
            lifting up his hands said: " I commend myself to Mary, <lb/>
            the holy mother of God, my heavenly mistress, that by her <lb/>
            blessed intercession I may be reconciled to her well­ <lb/>
            beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ." Having said this he <lb/>
            instantly expired. The physicians and others who were <lb/>
            present, who had watched the king all night while he slept, <lb/>
            his repose neither broken by cries or groans, seeing him <lb/>
            now expire so suddenly and unexpectedly, were much <lb/>
            astonished, and became as men who had lost their wits. <lb/>
            Notwithstanding, the wealthiest of them mounted their <lb/>
            horses and departed in baste to secure their property. <lb/>
            But the inferior attendants, observing that their masters <lb/>
            had disappeared, laid hands on the arms, the plate, the robes, <lb/>
            the linen, and all the royal furniture, and leaving the corpse <lb/>
            almost naked on the floor of the house hastened away.</p>
          <p>Observe then, I pray you, my readers, how little trust can <lb/>
            be placed in human fidelity. All these servants snatched up <lb/>
            what they could of the royal effects, like so many kites, and <lb/>
            took to their heels with their booty. Roguery thus came <lb/>
            forth from its hiding place the moment the great justiciary <lb/>
            was dead, and first exercised its rapacity round the corpse <lb/>
            of him who had so long repressed it.</p>
          <p>Intelligence of the king's death was quickly spread, and, <lb/>
            far and near, the hearts of those who heard it were filled with <lb/>
            joy or grief. In fact, King William's decease was known in <lb/>
            Rome and in Calabria to some of the exiles he had dis­ <lb/>
            inherited, the same day he died at Rouen, as they afterwards <lb/>
            solemnly asserted in Normandy. For the evil spirit was <lb/>
            frantic with joy on finding his servants, who were bent on <lb/>
            rapine and plunder, set free by the death of their judge,</p>
          <p>0, worldly pomp, how despicable you are when one <lb/>
            considers that you are empty and fleeting! You are justly <lb/>
            compared to watery bubbles, since at one moment you are <lb/>
            inflated and rise, and vanish the next. Behold this mighty <lb/>
            prince, who was lately obsequiously obeyed by more than a <lb/>
            hundred thousand men in arms, and at whose nod nations <lb/>
            trembled, was now stripped by his own attendants, in a <pb n="419"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1087.] </note> <lb/>
            house which was not his own; and left on the bare ground <lb/>
            from the hour of primes to that of tierce.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the citizens of Rouen having heard the <lb/>
            death of their prince, were in the greatest state of alarm; <lb/>
            almost all of them lost their reason, as if they had been <lb/>
            intoxicated, and were thrown into as much confusion as if <lb/>
            the city had been threatened with an assault by a powerful <lb/>
            army. Each quitted the place where he received the news, <lb/>
            and ran to confer with his wife, or the first friend or <lb/>
            acquaintance he met, as to what was to be done. Every one <lb/>
            removed, or prepared to remove, his valuables, concealing <lb/>
            them with alarm, lest they should be discovered.</p>
          <p>At length the religious, both clergy and monks, recovering <lb/>
            their courage and the use of their senses, formed a <lb/>
            procession; and, arrayed in their sacred vestments, with <lb/>
            crosses and censers, went in due order to St. Gervase, <lb/>
            where they commended the spirit of the departed king to <lb/>
            God, according to the holy rites of the Christian faith. <lb/>
            Then William, the archbishop, ordered the body to be <lb/>
            conveyed to Caen, and interred there in the abbey of St, <lb/>
            Stephen the protomartyr, which the king himself had <lb/>
            founded. His brother and other relations had already <lb/>
            quitted the place, and all his servants had deserted him, as <lb/>
            if he had been a barbarian; so that not one of the king's <lb/>
            attendants was found to take care of his corpse. However, <lb/>
            Herluin, a country knight, was induced by his natural <lb/>
            goodness to undertake the charge of the funeral, for the love <lb/>
            of God and the honour of his country. He therefore <lb/>
            procured at his own expense persons to embalm and carry <lb/>
            the body; and, hiring a hearse, he caused it to be carried to <lb/>
            the port on the Seine; and, embarking it on board a vessel, <lb/>
            conducted it by water and land to Caen.</p>
          <p>Then Gilbert, the lord abbot,1 with the whole convent of <lb/>
            monks, met the hearse in solemn procession, accompanied by <lb/>
            a sorrowing multitude of clerks and laymen, offering prayers. <lb/>
            But at this moment a sudden calamity filled the minds of all <lb/>
            with alarm. For a fire broke out in one of the houses, and, <lb/>
            shooting up prodigious volumes of flame, spread through <lb/>
            great part of the town of Caen, doing great damage. The <lb/>
            crowds, both of clergy and laity, hastened with one accord to <note type="footnote"> 1 Gilbert de Coutance?, abbot of St. Stephen at Caen, 1079—1101, </note> <note type="footnote"> E E 2 </note> <pb n="420"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. CH.XVI. </note> <lb/>
            extinguish the fire, so that the monks were left alone to <lb/>
            finish the service they had begun, and they brought the royal <lb/>
            corpse into the abbey church, chanting psalms.</p>
          <p>Afterwards, all the bishops and abbots of Normandy <lb/>
            assembled to perform the obsequies of the illustrious duke, <lb/>
            who was the father of his country. I will insert in this <lb/>
            work a short list of some of the number, for the information <lb/>
            of posterity. William, archbishop of Rouen; Odo, bishop <lb/>
            of Bayeux; Gilbert, bishop of Evreux; Gilbert Maminot, <lb/>
            bishop of Lisieux; Michael, bishop of Avranches ; Geoffrey, <lb/>
            bishop, of Coutances; and Gerard, bishop of Séez. Among <lb/>
            the abbots were the following: Anselm, of Bee; William de <lb/>
            Roos, of Fécamp; Gerbert, of Fontenelles; Guntard, of <lb/>
            Jumièges; Mainier, of St. Evroult; Fulk, of Dive; Durand, <lb/>
            of Troarn; Robert, of Séez; Osbern, of Bernai; Roger, of <lb/>
            St. Michael-in-peril-of-the-sea; the two abbots of Rouen, <lb/>
            Nicholas, of St. Ouen, and Walter, of Mont-de-la-Sainte- <lb/>
            Trinité; with many more, whom it would be tedious to <lb/>
            enumerate. All these assembled at the funeral of the illus­ <lb/>
            trious Baron, and buried him in the sanctuary, between the <lb/>
            choir and the altar.</p>
          <p>The mass ended, when the coffin was already lowered into <lb/>
            the grave, but the corpse was still on the bier, the great <lb/>
            Gilbert, bishop of Evreux, ascended the pulpit, and pro­ <lb/>
            nounced a long and eloquent discourse on the distinguished <lb/>
            character of the deceased prince. He expatiated on Wil­ <lb/>
            liam's having extended by his valour the bounds of the <lb/>
            Norman dominion, and raised his people to a pitch of <lb/>
            greatness surpassing the times of any of his predecessors; <lb/>
            and on his having maintained peace and justice in all his <lb/>
            states, wisely chastising thieves and robbers with the <lb/>
            scourge of the law, while he firmly defended the clergy and <lb/>
            monks, and defenceless people, with his meritorious sword. <lb/>
            When he had concluded his discourse he addressed himself <lb/>
            to the congregation, who were shedding affectionate tears <lb/>
            and attested his assertions, and added this supplication: <lb/>
            " As in this present life no man can live without sin, I be­ <lb/>
            seech you, for the love of Christ, that you earnestly inter­ <lb/>
            cede with Almighty God on behalf of our deceased prince, <lb/>
            and that yo.u kindly forgive him, if in aught he has offended <lb/>
            against you,” <pb n="421"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 10S7.] </note> </p>
          <p>Then Ascelin, son of Arthur, came forward from the <lb/>
            crowd, and preferred the following complaint with a loud <lb/>
            voice, in the hearing of all: " The land," he said, " on which <lb/>
            you stand was the yard belonging to my father's house, <lb/>
            which that man for whom you pray, when he was yet only <lb/>
            duke of Normandy,1 took forcible possession of, and in the <lb/>
            teeth of all justice, by an exercise of tyrannical power, here <lb/>
            founded this abbey. I therefore lay claim to this land, and <lb/>
            openly demand its restitution, and in God's name I forbid <lb/>
            the body of the spoiler being covered with earth which is <lb/>
            my property, and buried in my inheritance." The bishops <lb/>
            and other great men, on hearing this, and finding from <lb/>
            inquiries among his neighbours that he spoke the truth, <lb/>
            drew the man aside, and, instead of offering him any vio­ <lb/>
            lence, appeased his resentment with gentle ^ords and came <lb/>
            to terms with him. For the small space in which the grave <lb/>
            was made, they paid him on the spot sixty shillings, and <lb/>
            promised him a proportionable price for the rest of the land <lb/>
            which he claimed. This agreement they soon afterwards. <lb/>
            fulfilled, for the good of. the soul of the master they dearly <lb/>
            loved.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, before the conquest of England, when the abbey was built; at <lb/>

            he had sent a person in his confidence to remove the body of Duke Robert, <lb/>
            which had been interred at Nice, and bring it to Normandy. The mes­ <lb/>

            his sovereign's death while he was in Apulia, on his return home with <lb/>
            Robert's remains. He, therefore, inteired them there. The place where <lb/>

            been made too short, so that, as the king was very corpu­ <lb/>
            lent, the bowels burst, and -an intolerable stench affected <lb/>
            the by-standers and the rest of the crowd. The smoke of <lb/>
            incense and other aromatics ascended in clouds, but failed <lb/>
            to purify the tainted atmosphere. The priests therefore <lb/>
            hurried the conclusion of the funeral service and retired as <lb/>
            soon as possible, in great alarm, to their respective abodes.</p>
          <p>I have thus carefully investigated, and given a true ac­ <lb/>

            duke's death, not composing a well-feigned tragedy for the <lb/>
            lucre of gain, nor a humorous comedy to provoke the <lb/>
            laughter of parasites, but a true narrative of the various <lb/>
            events for the perusal of studious readers. In the midst of <lb/>
            prosperity adverse circumstances were permitted to arise, <lb/>
            that the hearts of men might be impressed with the fearful <lb/>
            warnings.</p>
          <p>A king once potent, and warlike, and the terror of the <lb/>
            numberless inhabitants of many provinces, lay naked on the <lb/>
            floor, deserted by those who owed him their birth, and those <lb/>
            he had fed and enriched. He needed the money of a <lb/>
            stranger for the cost of his funeral, and a coffin and bearers <lb/>
            were provided, at the expense of an ordinary person, for him, <lb/>
            who till then had been in the enjoyment of enormous wealth. <lb/>
            He was carried to the church, amidst flaming houses, by <lb/>
            trembling crowds, and a spot of freehold land was wanting <lb/>
            for the grave of one whose princely sway had extended over <lb/>
            so many cities, and towns, and villages. His corpulent <lb/>
            stomach, fattened with so many delicacies, shamefully burst, <lb/>
            to give a lesson, both to the prudent and the thoughtless, on <lb/>

            exile at St. Ouen in Flanders, charitable to the poor, gentle and agree­ <lb/>
            able to her attendants, courteous to strangers, and only severe to herself. <lb/>
            She afterwards removed to Bruges, and, after some years spent in the <lb/>
            exercises of virtue, departed in the Lord on August 24, 1087. The death- <lb/>
            bed of this chaste and pious princess was exempt from the remorse and the <lb/>
            scandals which disgraced the last hours of the enemy of her family. </note> <pb n="423"/>

            of that foul corpse, men were taught to strive earnestly, by <lb/>
            the rules of a salutary temperance, after better things than <lb/>
            the delights of the flesh, which is dust, and must return to <lb/>

          <p>IN, the year of our Lord's incarnation 1087,1 the tenth in­ <lb/>
            diction, William the Bastard, king of England, died at <lb/>
            Rouen on the fifth of the ides [9th] September, and his <lb/>
            remains were interred at Caen, in the church of St. Stephen, <lb/>
            the proto-martyr. His son Robert then became, in name <lb/>
            at least, duke of Normandy and lord of Maine, but aban­ <lb/>
            doning himself to sloth and indulgence, his government was <lb/>
            never remarkable for virtue and justice. William Rufus de­ <lb/>
            livered his father's letter2 to Archbishop Lanfranc, on pe­ <lb/>
            rusing which that prelate hastened with the young prince <lb/>
            to London, and crowned him in the old church of St. Peter <lb/>
            the apostle, called Westminster, on the feast of St. Michael. <lb/>
            His reign lasted twelve years and ten months ;3 and, as to <lb/>
            the affairs of this world, he endeavoured to follow his <lb/>
            father's example in some things, being distinguished for his <lb/>
            valour and secular magnificence, while he was but too prone <lb/>
            to pride, lust, and other vices. But he had but scanty zeal <lb/>
            for the worship of God and frequenting the services of the <lb/>
            church.</p>
          <p>He delivered to Otho the goldsmith4 a large quantity of <lb/>
            gold, silver, and precious stones, ordering him to erect a <lb/>
            monument of extraordinary magnificence over his father's <lb/>
            tomb. Accordingly, in obedience to the royal commands, <note type="footnote"> 1 The Paris edition (1845) of Ordericus gives the date in the text as <lb/>
            1082; but it is probably a misprint, as the learned editor, in a note in the <lb/>
            same page, fixes the accession of William Rufus in 1087, which is the true <lb/>
            date of the death of William the Conqueror. The text of Duchesne, and <lb/>

            he executed the work in an admirable manner, and the tomb <lb/>
            may be now seen resplendent with gold, silver, and gems. <lb/>
            Skilful versifiers have composed a number of noble and ele­ <lb/>

            copious a theme for their poetical genius, but I shall only <lb/>
            insert the epitaph written by Thomas, archbishop of York,1 <lb/>
            out of respect for his metropolitan dignity. <lb/>
            Here WILLIAM, greatest of his princely race, <lb/>
            A home, a tomb, finds in this narrow space. <lb/>
            Him the fierce Normans faithful homage paid, <lb/>
            And lordly Maine his stern commands obeyed ; <lb/>
            But mightier still, he England's sceptre swayed, <lb/>
            The glorious prize, when Senlac's bloody field 2 <lb/>
            Saw her brave sons before the Conqueror yield. <lb/>

            'Mid the bright Virgin's stars his course had run, <lb/>
            To Him who rules on high he bowed his head, <lb/>
            And the proud king was numbered with the dead.4</p>
          <p>Many of the Norman nobility died the same year as their <lb/>
            sovereign. During his last illness his cousin Gilbert d'Au­ <lb/>

            the church of St. Mary, which he had endowed for the <lb/>
            maintenance of six monks of the abbey of St. Evroult. <lb/>
            Four years afterwards the pious lady, his wife Beatrix,6 <lb/>

            January. At the death of their duke many of the Normans <lb/>
            were plunged into grief, if not for him, at least for their <lb/>
            friends and relations who died about the same period, <lb/>
            among whom were Simon de Montfort,1 son-in-law of <lb/>
            Richard, Count d'Evreux, Hugh Paganel,2 Hugh, son of <lb/>
            Hugh de Grantmesnil,3 a young man of distinguished <lb/>
            bravery, and his cousin Robert de Rhuddlan,4 William <lb/>
            d'Avranches," son of Witmond,5 with many other men of <note type="footnote"> I Simon de Montfort, father of Amauri de Montfort, who inherited the <lb/>
            county of Evroux after his uncle William's death. Our author has <lb/>
            already related that this marriage was effected by carrying off in the night <lb/>
            Agnes d'Evreux, with the aid of Ralph, lord of Conches, her half-brother, <lb/>
            and Simon's brother-in-law. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 William Paganel, lord of Montiers-Hubert, which is supposed to have <lb/>
            been the original seat of this ancient family, and not their estates in the <lb/>
            Cotentin. William was probably the eldest brother of Ralph Paganel, <lb/>
            sheriff of Yorkshire, who possessed forty-five lordships at the time Domes­ <lb/>
            day-book was made, and founded the priory of the Holy Trinity at York <lb/>
            in the reign of William Rufus. Fulk, the founder of the family of <lb/>
            the Paganels of Dudley, who was living in 1130, was grandson of this <lb/>
            William. </note><note type="footnote"> Ralph Paganel had a son also named William, whose daughter was <lb/>
            married first to Richard de Courci, and secondly to Robert de Gant. His <lb/>
            eldest son, Alexander, was the founder of the family of the Paganels of <lb/>
            Hooton in Yorkshire. </note><note type="footnote"> William Paganel (II.) also held the lordships of Drax, West-Rasen, <lb/>
            &amp;c., by grant from the king. He died about 1150, leaving four children, <lb/>
            the eldest of whom received from Henry II., then count of Anjou and <lb/>
            duke of Normandy, all his father's barony in Normandy and England, <lb/>
            except Bréhal. From this Hugh descended the branch who were lords of <lb/>
            West-Rasen in Lincolnshire, who lost their family estate of Montiers in the <lb/>
            time of Philip Augustus; and from Fulk, his eldest brother, those of the <lb/>
            Paganels of Hamby, lords of Drax. Having settled in Normandy, and <lb/>
            entirely attached himself to the kings of France, Drax was taken from him <lb/>
            and given to Hugh Paganel, to indemnify him for the loss of Montiers. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Hugh, third son of Hugh de Grantmesnil. It will appear hereafter <lb/>
            that this young nobleman was buried at St. Evroult. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Robert de Rhuddlan will be spoken of in the third chapter of the <lb/>

            married Matilda, daughter of Baldwin de Meules, and granddaughter of <lb/>
            Gilbert, lord of Sap and Meules, and sheriff of Devonshire. She brought <lb/>
            him the estate of Dolton in that county. William d'Avranches was lord <lb/>
            of Folkstone in Kent, which remained in the possession of his male heirs <lb/>
            until the beginning of the thirteenth century. At this time it passed by <lb/>
            marriage to the family of Crevecœur. William's son, Robert d'Avranches, <lb/>
            was living in 1130. Besides his daughter, married to William Paganel, he <lb/>
            had a natural daughter, afterwards legitimated, who was called Matilda </note> <pb n="427"/>

            eminence. Happy those who, departing thus opportunely, <lb/>
            were spared the pain of seeing their country desolated and <lb/>
            having no protector!</p>
          <p>At that time affairs in Normandy suffered a great revolu­ <lb/>
            tion ; the unarmed population shuddered with alarm, while <lb/>
            the powerful gave full vent to their towering ambition with­ <lb/>
            out any check. Robert de Belèsme1 had been on his way to <lb/>
            court to confer with the king on urgent affairs, but on <lb/>
            arriving at the gate of Brionne he learnt the king's death. <lb/>
            Thereupon he immediately turned his horse round, and <lb/>
            hastening to Alençon2 took the royal garrison by surprise <lb/>
            and drove them out of the castle. He did the same at <lb/>
            Belèsme and all his other strongholds, and not only in his <lb/>
            own, but in those of such of his neighbours as he conde­ <lb/>
            scended to consider as his equals. All these he either got <lb/>
            into his power by introducing his own adherents, or razed <lb/>
            to the ground to prevent their offering him any resistance <lb/>
            thereafter. William, Count d'Evreux, also expelled the <lb/>
            royal warders from the keep of his castle, and William de <lb/>
            Breteuil, Ralph de Conches, and all the rest, got their for­ <lb/>
            tresses into their own hands, so that every one might be <lb/>
            able to prosecute with impunity his infernal feuds against <lb/>
            his neighbours, and those whose territories bordered on his <lb/>
            own. In this manner the Norman lords drove out the royal <lb/>
            garrisons from their castles, and alternately ravaged the <lb/>
            country, which was rich and flourishing, with bands of their <lb/>
            own retainers. The wealth which had been plundered from <lb/>
            the English and other nations was thus deservedly lost by <lb/>
            rapine and violence.</p>
          <p>All the world knew that the Duke Robert was sunk in <note type="footnote"> d'Avranches, who brought to Robert, the bastard son of Henry I. (and <lb/>
            earl of Gloucester), one half of the lordships of Sap and Meules. <lb/>
            This family of Avranches must not be confounded with that of the <lb/>
            viscounts d'Avranches, eails of Chester. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Robert became count de Belèsme (the second of his name) on the <lb/>

            sloth and carelessness, so that he was despised by men of <lb/>
            enterprise who fomented traitorous insurrections at their <lb/>
            pleasure. The duke was personally brave and daring, and <lb/>
            had many merits ; was a good speaker, but inconsiderate in <lb/>
            conducting his affairs, profuse in spending, and liberal in his <lb/>
            promises, while no dependence could be placed upon them ; <lb/>
            he was compassionate to those who implored his mercy, but <lb/>
            too gentle and easy in executing justice on offenders; <lb/>
            changeable in his resolutions, and too affable and conde­ <lb/>
            scending in his general behaviour, he was held in contempt <lb/>
            by the evil-minded and those who wanted discretion; his <lb/>
            figure was short and corpulent, from which his father gave <lb/>
            him the surname of Curt-hose. Endeavouring to please <lb/>
            all, he gave, promised, or yielded, what every one asked. <lb/>
            His prodigality led him daily to lessen the domains of his <lb/>
            ancestors, absurdly granting whatever was demanded of him, <lb/>
            so that he impoverished himself while he augmented the <lb/>
            power of others to injure him. He gave to William de <lb/>
            Breteuil, Ivri, where there is a well-fortified castle, erected <lb/>
            by his grandmother Alberede;1 and he granted to Roger de <lb/>
            Beaumont, who had the custody of Ivri, under King <lb/>
            William, Brionne, a strong fortress in the heart of his terri­ <lb/>

          <p>Odo, bishop of Bayeux, being released from prison, re­ <lb/>
            gained all his former possessions in Normandy, and became <lb/>
            the counsellor of the young duke, his nephew. This prelate <lb/>
            was a person of distinguished eloquence and high spirit; he <lb/>
            was liberal, and his bravery would have become a secular <lb/>
            man: but he treated men of religion with great respect, <lb/>
            protecting his clergy resolutely both by word and arms, and <lb/>
            enriching the churches with valuable ornaments wherever <lb/>
            they were needed. I The buildings he erected are proof this, <lb/>
            with the splendid vessels and vestments in gold and silver <lb/>
            which his liberality furnished for the use of the churches <lb/>
            and clergy. His near relationship to Duke William pro­ <lb/>
            cured for him the bishopric of Bayeux while he was very <lb/>

            some parts of his conduct, in others the flesh was sadly pre­ <lb/>
            dominant over the spirit. Led away by carnal passions, he <lb/>
            had a son named John, who is now about the court of King <lb/>
            Henry,1 where he is eminent for his eloquence and virtues. <lb/>
            But while, in some things, Bishop Odo lent himself to <lb/>
            worldly vanities, externally he did much for the advantage <lb/>
            of the church. He laid the foundations of the church of <lb/>
            St. Mary, mother of God, and completed it in a beautiful <lb/>
            style of architecture, amply providing it with wealth and <lb/>
            ornaments.2 He established monks in the church of St. <lb/>
            Vigor,3 bishop of Bayeux, which stands outside the city­ <lb/>
            walls, and appointed as their superior, Robert de Tombe­ <lb/>
            laine, a pious and learned man, who, among other monu­ <lb/>
            ments of his ability, has left the church a short and clear, <lb/>
            but profound, commentary on the Canticles. After Bishop <lb/>
            Odo was thrown into prison, Abbot Robert, abandoning <lb/>
            all, went into foreign countries, and arriving at Home, <lb/>
            was detained by Pope Gregory VII who paid him great <lb/>
            respect, and he served the Roman church faithfully until <lb/>
            his death.4 The bishop who founded it being in confine­ <lb/>

            in October, 1049. Odo himself died at Palermo in February, 1097. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 It appears, therefore, that this chapter was written before the death of <lb/>

            1106. The crypt under the choir is, perhaps, the only part of the original <lb/>
            church built by Bishop Odo, which now remains. It is supported on <lb/>
            twelve pillars with rude capitals. The west end of the nave of the present <lb/>
            edifice consists of florid Norman arches and pillars, attributed to Henry II., <lb/>
            but which M. Le Prévost considers to be part of Bishop Odo's building. <lb/>
            The end nearest the transept , and the choir, were built in the pointed <lb/>
            style by Bishop Henry de Beaumont in 1205. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 This foundation was made in 1066. Odo took Robert de Tombelaine, <lb/>
            as well as fiveother monks, from the abbey of Mont St. Michael, making <lb/>
            him abbot of the new foundation. Tombelaine is a rock near the former <lb/>
            abbey, standing in the middle of the sands, and surrounded by the sea at <lb/>
            high tides. There are still some ruins of the houses and castle which were <lb/>
            in existence as late as the fifteenth century. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 For the life and works of Robert de Tombelaine, see L'Histoire <lb/>

            trary (Gall. Christ, t. xi. p. 404), that having lost his patron, Gregory <lb/>

            convent of monks dispersed, and each one settling himself <lb/>
            where he could, they never returned to that monastery.</p>
          <p>In the end, Bishop Odo gave it to Jarenton, abbot of <lb/>
            Dijon, and it continues to this day to be a cell of the monks <lb/>
            of that abbey.1 It is thus plain that the prelate of whom I <lb/>
            'am speaking had a strong regard for the monastic order. <lb/>
            He also sent intelligent young clerks to Liege and other <lb/>
            places where he knew that the study of philosophy flourished <lb/>
            most, making them liberal allowances for their maintenance, <lb/>
            that they might, uninterruptedly and for a long period, em­ <lb/>
            ploy themselves in the pursuit of learning.2 Among the <lb/>
            scholars he thus supplied with the means of education were <lb/>
            Thomas, archbishop of York,3 and his brother Samson,4 <lb/>
            bishop of Worcester, William de Roos,5 abbot of Fécamp, and <lb/>
            Thurstan, abbot of Glastonbury, with many others who flou­ <lb/>
            rished during my time in the church of God, and largely pro­ <lb/>
            fited the flocks committed to their charge with the excellence <lb/>
            of their teachings and the example of. their eminent virtues. <lb/>
            In this manner, although Bishop Odo was deeply entangled <lb/>
            in secular affairs, much that was laudable mixed itself with <lb/>
            his evil deeds, and what he iniquitously amassed was freely <lb/>
            bestowed on the churches and the poor. At length, by the <lb/>
            will of God, he left all in the year of our Lord 1096, the <lb/>
            fourth indiction, and accompanied his nephew, Duke Robert, <lb/>
            in his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, as, with God's permission, <lb/>
            we shall more particularly relate hereafter. He died at <lb/>
            Palermo in the presence of Gilbert, bishop of Evreux ; his <lb/>
            body was interred in the church of St. Mary, where Roger, <note type="footnote"> 1 The two charters, one of Bishop Odo and the other of Duke Robert, <lb/>

            him.</p>
          <p>Robert, duke of Normandy, distributed his wealth among <lb/>
            his knights with a liberal hand, attaching to his person a <lb/>
            number of young aspirants to arms who coveted his favour <lb/>
            and rewards. His treasury beginning to fail, he sent to his <lb/>
            brother Henry, requesting a supply from his abundant <lb/>
            wealth-a demand Henry was by no means disposed to grant. <lb/>
            The duke then sent word that he was ready to sell him a <lb/>
            part of his territories ; and when Henry understood this, he <lb/>
            was most ready to comply with his brother's proposal. Terms <lb/>
            were therefore concluded between them, by which Henry <lb/>
            paid the duke three thousand pounds of silver, and received <lb/>
            in exchange the whole of the district of the Cotentin, which <lb/>
            is a third of all Normandy.2 In this way Henry first ob­ <lb/>
            tained Avranches and Coutances, Mont St. Michael-in- <lb/>
            peril-of-the-Sea, and the entire of the lordship which Hugh, <lb/>
            earl of Chester, held in Normandy. Prince Henry governed <lb/>
            the Cotentin discreetly, and employed his early years in <lb/>
            worthy pursuits. From his very childhood, his parents had <lb/>
            devoted him to the study of letters, and he became admi­ <lb/>
            rably imbued with the knowledge both of moral and natural <lb/>
            philosophy. Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, as soon <lb/>
            as the young prince was of a fitting age, armed him for the <lb/>
            defence of the kingdom, clothing him with a breastplate, <lb/>
            putting a helmet on his head, and giving him the belt of <lb/>
            knighthood, in the name of the Lord, as the king's son, and <lb/>
            born on the steps of the throne.3 During the twelve years <lb/>
            of the reign of William Rufus in England, Henry had an <lb/>
            active life with various changes of fortune, and acquired ex­ <lb/>
            perience, both from prosperity and adversity. At length, <lb/>
            on his brother's death, he ascended the throne, which he has <note type="footnote"> 1 Roger I., count of Sicily, 1072—July, 1101. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Avranches, being a part of the ceded territory, must be added, as well <lb/>

          <p>IN the first year of the government of the two brothers, <lb/>
            there was a meeting of the great men of both states, to con­ <lb/>
            sult among themselves on the circumstances in which they <lb/>
            were placed by the division of the sovereignty formerly <lb/>
            lodged in the same hands. " We are suddenly involved," <lb/>
            they said, in a serious difficulty, and threatened with a great <lb/>
            diminution of our power and wealth. Hitherto we have <lb/>
            maintained ourselves with honour, under illustrious dukes, in <lb/>
            the possession of Normandy, which our ancestors who came <lb/>
            with Rollo from Denmark, two hundred and twelve years <lb/>
            ago,2 gained with their daring valour. Afterwards we <lb/>
            crossed the sea with Duke William, and subduing the Anglo- <lb/>
            Saxons by the might of our arms, seized their lands and <lb/>
            wealth, for which we freely shed our blood. Alas! we are <lb/>
            now witnesses of a great revolution, and the sudden over­ <lb/>
            throw of our power. What are we to do ? On the death <lb/>
            of our old sovereign, he is succeeded by two young princes, <lb/>
            and the dominion of England and Normandy is suddenly <lb/>
            divided. How can we conveniently serve two lords so dif­ <lb/>
            ferent and so remote from each other ? If we do our duty <lb/>
            to Robert, the duke of Normandy, we shall offend his <lb/>
            brother William. It will follow that we shall forfeit our <lb/>
            great revenues and high honours in England. On the <lb/>
            other hand, if we keep our fealty to King William, Duke <lb/>
            Robert will take from us our patrimonial estates in Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy. It behoves its to avoid such a separation under <note type="footnote"> 1 This passage fixes the date at which this part of Ordericus's History <lb/>

            these princes as occurred among the Israelites in the time <lb/>
            of Rehoboam and Jeroboam. Then one people was divided <lb/>
            among itself between two rulers, and the law, the temple <lb/>
            and the worship of God being neglected, fell into apostacy. <lb/>
            At length one part of them were carried captives into <lb/>
            Media by the Assyrians and never returned, and the rest <lb/>
            underwent the Babylonish captivity under the Chaldeans. <lb/>
            What happened to the Thebans under the two brothers, <lb/>
            Eteocles and Polynices ? Did not many thousands perish <lb/>
            on both sides ? At last both brothers fell in mutual en­ <lb/>
            counter, and left the succession of their inheritance to <lb/>
            strangers. It behoves us carefully to consider these and <lb/>
            such-like instances, and to take prudent precautions that <lb/>
            we may not be ruined by the policy of these youthful <lb/>
            princes. Let us therefore enter into a firm and inviolable <lb/>
            league, and having deposed King William or put him to <lb/>
            death, as he is the youngest and most arrogant, and we <lb/>
            owe him nothing, let us make Duke Robert, who is the <lb/>
            elder brother, and of a more pliable temper, and to whom we <lb/>
            have already sworn fealty during his father's life,1 sovereign <lb/>
            both of England and Normandy, that the union of the two <lb/>
            states may be maintained.</p>
          <p>This resolution was taken, with common consent, by <lb/>
            Odo, bishop of Bayeux, Eustace, count of Boulogne,2 Robert <lb/>
            de Belèsme, and many others, and their intentions were an­ <lb/>
            nounced to Duke Robert. That thoughtless and inconside­ <lb/>
            rate prince was highly delighted with their empty promises, <lb/>
            and pledged himself to second their undertaking in all points <lb/>
            and shortly afford them effectual succour for the successful <lb/>
            prosecution of so great an enterprise. Accordingly, after <lb/>

            assumed his association with his father in the government of Normandy- <lb/>

            from him any share in the government. See his reply to the duke's <lb/>

            increasing the garrisons, and drawing in abundant supplies <lb/>
            of food both for men and horses. Already rapacious free­ <lb/>
            booters began to pillage the peasants eagerly anticipating <lb/>
            the arrival of Duke Robert, who had determined to follow <lb/>
            his precursors with the returning spring, at the head of a <lb/>
            large body of troops. At the same time Osbern, son of <lb/>

            once against the rebels to give them battle. Upon this, <lb/>
            Odo, bishop of Bayeux, shut himself up in the city of <lb/>
            Rochester with five hundred men-at-arms, determining to <lb/>
            wait the arrival of Duke Robert, with the auxiliary forces <lb/>
            he had promised to bring; for the league, although they <lb/>
            were very numerous, and had great resources in money and <lb/>
            arms, and vast supplies, did not dare to meet the king in <lb/>
            open fight within his own realm. They therefore, with <lb/>
            great prudence, selected Rochester, because, if the king did <lb/>
            not'blockade them in the city, the position was central for <lb/>
            making sudden eruptions and plundering London and Can­ <lb/>
            terbury, and they could also take advantage of the sea, which <lb/>
            lies very near, and the neighbouring islands, to despatch mes­ <lb/>
            sengers to obtain assistance. The resolute king, however, <lb/>
            anticipated their projects, and, in the month of May, in­ <lb/>
            vested the place with a powerful army; and, erecting two <lb/>
            forts, shut up the enemy within the walls, so that every <lb/>
            avenue of egress was closed. As I have said before, Bishop <lb/>
            Odo, Count Eustace, and Robert de Belèsme,1 with many <lb/>
            nobles, as well as persons of moderate station, held the <lb/>
            place, expecting, in vain, succours from Duke Robert, who <lb/>
            was detained by sloth and indulgence. However Roger, <lb/>
            earl of Mercia,2 and many other Normans who were in the <lb/>
            besieging army gave secret aid to the besieged, as far as it <lb/>
            was in their power, although they did not venture to appear <lb/>
            openly in arms against the king. All the bishops of Eng­ <lb/>
            land joined the English people in loyally supporting the <lb/>
            king, and laboured to restore in the country that tranquil­ <lb/>

          <p>A plague, like the plague of the Egyptians, made its <lb/>
            appearance in the town of Rochester, the Almighty, who, in <lb/>
            all ages, superintends human affairs and orders them aright, <lb/>
            having chosen to renew an ancient miracle in modern times. <lb/>
            For as the flies tormented the Egyptians, and did not cease <lb/>
            a moment from whizzing round them, in the same manner <lb/>
            these flies grievously annoyed the besieged with their <lb/>
            incessant attacks; for all egress from the castle was pre­ <lb/>
            vented, and many of those who were thus blockaded fell <lb/>
            sick from their various sufferings, and, their disorders in­ <lb/>
            creasing, at length died. Innumerable flies were engendered <lb/>
            in the dung of men and horses, and being nourished by the <lb/>
            heat both of the summer, and of the atmosphere caused by <lb/>
            the breath of so many inhabitants closely pent up, their <lb/>
            swarms horribly infested their eyes and noses, food and <lb/>
            drink. So severely was the insolent band of rebels afflicted <lb/>
            with the annoyance of the swarms that they could not eat <lb/>
            their meals, either by day or night, unless a great number <lb/>
            of them were employed, in turn, in flapping them away <lb/>
            from their comrades' faces. In consequence, Odo and his <lb/>
            allies could no longer suffer the miseries of the siege ;1 they <note type="footnote"> 1 Florence of Worcester gives a somewhat different account of these <lb/>
            transactions. He says that Robert Curl-hose despatched the earls of <lb/>
            Boulogne and Belèsme, with a body of auxiliaries, to support Bishop Odo, <lb/>
            promising to follow himself with a larger force. This was the first notice <lb/>
            the king had of the danger which threatened him, and he immediately <lb/>
            summoned such of the barons as he could rely on, and assembling a small <lb/>
            body of troops at London, more English than Normans, marched for <lb/>
            Rochester, taking Tunbridge in. the way. He reduced that castle after <lb/>
            two days' siege, having wounded Richard de Bienfacte, one of the con­ <lb/>
            spirators, who held it, and forced him to capitulate. On the king's <lb/>
            approach to Rochester, after this success, Odo made his escape, and took <lb/>
            refuge in Pevensey Castle with his brother, the earl of Morton. The king, <lb/>
            however, deferred the siege of Rochester, the garrison of which, in the <lb/>
            meantime, ravaged the whole neighbourhood, and followed the bishop to <lb/>
            Pevensey. It was at this period that the insurrection burst forth in <lb/>
            several quarters, as mentioned in preceding notes. Pevensey surrendered <lb/>
            to the king's troops after holding out s x weeks, and Bishop Odo was <lb/>
            taken, and, as Henry of Huntingdon says (p. 225, Bohn's Antiq. Library), <lb/>
            solemnly swore to depart the realm, and to deliver up the city of </note> <pb n="438"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            therefore sent envoys to the king, asking for peace and offer­ <lb/>
            ing to surrender the place. The terms proposed were these: <lb/>
            that they should be re-instated in the lands, the fiefs, and all <lb/>
            the possessions they before had, and should, for the future, <lb/>
            serve him loyally as their natural lord. The king was <lb/>
            greatly incensed at these proposals, and, so far from making <lb/>
            any concession, and accepting the terms offered by the <lb/>
            envoys, he swore that he would seize, by force of arms, the <lb/>
            perfidious traitors shut up in the town, and forthwith hang <lb/>
            them on gibbets, or sweep them from the earth by other <lb/>
            kinds of death. When, however, those who were engaged <lb/>
            in the siege in the royal cause perceived that the king was <lb/>
            so inflamed with passion against their relations and friends <lb/>
            within the fortress as to threaten their execution, they came <lb/>
            about him with deep supplications, and endeavoured to pro­ <lb/>
            pitiate him by earnest prayers and flattering words. Thus <lb/>
            they said: " Praise be to God who is ever the helper of <lb/>
            those who trust in him, and grants that good parents shall <lb/>
            succeeded by worthy children." Lo ! these aspiring youths, <lb/>
            and old men blinded by their ambition, have sufficiently <lb/>
            learnt, that the royal authority in this land is not yet <lb/>
            extinct; for those who flocked'here out of Normandy, to <lb/>
            prey upon us like ravenous kites, have discovered, through <lb/>
            the interposition of God, that William the younger is not <lb/>
            less powerful than William the elder. Already half con. <lb/>
            quered they submit to your arms; and, confessing your <lb/>
            might, approach you as suppliants. We too, who have <lb/>
            stood by you in the hour of your greatest peril, as we did <lb/>
            by your father, now humbly approach you with earnest in­ <lb/>

            who have subdued by your valour these senseless and trem­ <lb/>
            bling men, to extend your clemency to them now that they <lb/>
            are humbled and penitent. Let mercy temper the king's <lb/>

            his oath, and having got into the city remained there until, on its <lb/>
            surrender, he became again a captive. It was at this period, Florence of <lb/>
            Worcester informs us, that the king summoned the great body of his <lb/>
            English subjects to his side, with such success that the Normans in <lb/>
            Rochester, brave and numerous as the garrison was, could no longer resist <lb/>
            the numbers which flocked to the king's standard; and the garrison was <lb/>

            Shimei who cursed him,1 and entreated Joab and Abishai <lb/>
            and his other general,,;, not to slay Absalom his adversary.2 <lb/>
            Examples of this sort abound in the sacred volume, and the <lb/>
            lines of the sagacious poet, in his work on the Wonders of <lb/>
            the World, are to the same purport. <lb/>
            " 'Tis lion-like to spare a fallen foe, <lb/>
            And lion-hearted kings should thus their greatness show." 3</p>
          <p>King William replied to these observations ; " I confess <lb/>
            that it is through your prowess I have subdued the enemy, <lb/>
            and, by God's help, with your valour, the victory is almost <lb/>
            gained. But you ought to be the more cautious not to <lb/>
            induce me by your supplications to deviate from the course <lb/>
            of strict justice. When we spare perjurers and robbers, <lb/>
            plunderers, and execrable traitors, we destroy the peace and <lb/>
            security of the well-disposed, and sow the seeds of endless <lb/>
            slaughter and pillage among the innocent and defenceless. <lb/>
            In what have I offended these criminal men ? What injury <lb/>
            have I done them ? Why have they sought to destroy me <lb/>
            by every means in their power, and raised insurrections <lb/>
            among the people wherever they could, to so much public <lb/>
            loss ? I confirmed them in all their rights, and have given <lb/>
            them no cause to revolt against me ; and yet they are be­ <lb/>
            come my determined enemies. I consider it just to follow <lb/>
            rigidly the judgment of the great king David, whose ex­ <lb/>
            ample you set before me; thus, as Baanah and Rechab, <lb/>
            the sons of Rimmon, the Beerothite, who beheaded Ishbo­ <lb/>

            demned to be hung,4 so these seditious men shall be fearfully <lb/>

            consider who these persons are, on whose behalf we so <lb/>
            earnestly implore your clemency. Odo, of Bayeux, is your <lb/>
            uncle, and has been consecrated a bishop. He assisted your <lb/>
            father in his conquest of England, and to his great peril <lb/>
            stood by him in many straits. What can you do with a man of <lb/>
            his eminence ? Far be it from you to lay hands on a priest <lb/>
            of the Lord, and shed his blood for such a cause. Recollect <lb/>
            what Saul did at Nob,1 and what he suffered in Mount. <lb/>
            Gilboah ?2 Who will be so wicked as to venture to advise <lb/>
            you to condemn the Lord's bishop, and your own uncle ? <lb/>
            No one. It is therefore our unanimous request that you <lb/>
            will extend your clemency to him, and permit him to depart <lb/>
            without injury to his own diocese in Normandy. The count <lb/>
            of Boulogne was also faithful to your father, and his valiant <lb/>
            supporter and comrade in many a desperate battle. Robert <lb/>
            de Belèsme likewise, who was much esteemed by your father, <lb/>
            and promoted by him to great honours, has now obtained <lb/>
            mastery of great part of Normandy, and being possessed of <lb/>
            the strongest castles, holds the first rank among his neigh­ <lb/>
            bours, and the Norman lords. If you temper your animosity <lb/>
            against these great men, and treat them graciously here, or <lb/>
            permit them to depart in safety, you may advantageously <lb/>
            use their amity and service, on many future occasions. ' He <lb/>

          <p>In consequence, the noble-minded king, vanquished by <lb/>

            and relieving the besieged from the sentence of death or <lb/>
            mutilation, granted them leave to depart from the place <lb/>
            with their horses and arms. But he utterly refused them <lb/>
            all expectation of having any inheritance or lauds within the <lb/>
            realm of England, as long as he was on the throne. ThenThen <lb/>
            bishop Odo attempted to procure the king's commandthat <lb/>
            the trumpeters should not sound a flourish while the gar­ <lb/>
            rison marched out, as is the custom when an enemy is <lb/>
            conquered, and a fortresss is taken by storm. But the king <lb/>
            fell into a great passion, and would not listen to what was <lb/>
            asked, asserting that he would not grant it for a thousand <lb/>
            marks of gold. The garrison therefore marched out with <lb/>
            sorrow and dejection, while the royal trumpets sounded in <lb/>
            notes of triumph, and the crowds of English who were on <lb/>
            the king's side shouted aloud, " Halters, bring halters,1 and. <lb/>
            hang this traitor-bishop with his accomplices on a gallows. <lb/>
            Great king of England, why do you permit this author of <lb/>
            all our woes to escape safe and sound ? This perjured homi­ <lb/>
            cide, who has caused the death of thousands by his plots <lb/>
            and his cruelties, ought not to be suffered to live." The <lb/>
            crest-fallen bishop and his associates were compelled to <lb/>
            listen to the foul reproaches which were heaped upon them, <lb/>
            but although they were threatened with a bitter fate, per­ <lb/>
            mission was not granted for the populace to wreak their ven­ <lb/>
            geance on them. Thus the unholy bishop was banished from <lb/>
            England, and his vast domains were forfeited, so that the <lb/>
            prodigious wealth which he had iniquitously amassed, was, <lb/>
            by the just judgment of God, lost with signal disgrace. He <lb/>
            retired in confusion to Bayeux, and never again set foot in <lb/>

            acted with great caution, watching his opportunity for <lb/>
            taking revenge. The factious attempts of some of his ene­ <lb/>
            mies he punished with the utmost severity of the law, but <lb/>
            designedly winked at the offences of others. The old barons <lb/>
            who had shown some signs of disaffection to him, were pru­ <lb/>
            dently spared, both out of regard to his father's memory, to <lb/>
            whom they had been loyally attached, and from respect to <lb/>
            their age; for he shrewdly thought that disease and death <lb/>
            would soon prevent their giving him any trouble. Some, <lb/>
            however, served him the more faithfully in after times, on <lb/>
            account of their having been deeper involved in the crime of <lb/>
            treason, and tried to render themselves acceptable to him by <lb/>
            their gifts, their services, and their flatteries.</p>

          <p>IN consequence of the shock which England received from <lb/>
            the violence of the storm we have just described, and or the <lb/>
            wounds which were daily inflicted by its inhabitants on <lb/>
            each other, divided as they were into two parties, one of <lb/>
            which tried to depose the king, while the other stoutly <lb/>
            maintained his cause, Gryffith, king of Wales,1 at the head <lb/>
            of an army, made an inroad on the English borders, and <lb/>
            devastated the country about Rhuddlan with fire and sword, <lb/>
            taking much booty and many captives. On the return of <lb/>
            Robert, lord of Rhuddlan, from the siege of Rochester,2 he <lb/>
            received intelligence of these barbarities and his severe <lb/>
            losses which filled him with grief, and drew from him in his <note type="footnote"> I Gryffith-ap-Conan, who after his victory over Howel-ap-Owen in 1076, <lb/>
            reigned, it is said, at least at intervals, until 1136. Gryffith was allied to <lb/>
            the Anglo-Saxon kings, being son-in-law of King Owen, the grandson of <lb/>
            Grono, who married Ethefleda, widow of Edmund Ironsides. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Robert de Rhuddlan had joined the league against William Rufus, <lb/>
            but after the siege of Rochester, as it here appears, returned to his duties <lb/>
            in Wales. He belonged to the great family of Grantmesnil by the father's <lb/>
            side, and to that of Giroie, of which our author gives so much detail in the <lb/>
            first volume, by his mother's. </note> <lb/>

            wrath the most terrible threats. He was a brave and active <lb/>
            knight, free of speech, a formidable enemy, but generous, <lb/>
            and celebrated for his many deeds of valour. He had been <lb/>
            one of king Edward's squires, and received from him the <lb/>
            belt of knighthood. His father, Umfrid, was son of Amfrid <lb/>
            of Danish race: his mother, Adeliza, was sister of Hugh <lb/>
            de Grantmesnil, of the noble family of Giroie. This dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished warrior, in the midst of his military employments, <lb/>
            did not neglect the church, constantly treating the clergy and <lb/>
            monks with great respect, and giving liberal alms to the <lb/>
            poor, according to his means.</p>
          <p>The abbey of St. Evroult, where his brothers Arnold and <lb/>
            Roger were monks, and his father and mother and other <lb/>
            relations lay buried, was much beloved by him, and he en­ <lb/>
            dowed it to the best of his power. In consequence, be gave <lb/>
            to it the church of Tilleul,1 and his portion of the church of <lb/>
            Damblainville,2 with the presbytery,and all that belonged to <lb/>
            him in the church of Cornered He added the tithe of his <lb/>
            mills, and of all his rents, with an additional tenth from his <lb/>
            butlery and cellar.4 The same Robert gave to the monks of <lb/>
            St. Evroult, of his possessions in England, Little-Cwm,5 <lb/>
            comprising two plough-lands, and twenty villeins; also, the <lb/>
            tithes, and the whole vill called Kirkby,6 with the church and <lb/>
            presbytery, and the church of the Island,7 and the church of <lb/>
            St. Peter-in-the Market, and three cottages in the city of <lb/>
            Chester: and that St. Evroult might possess all these in <lb/>
            perpetuity and without molestation, he came in person to a <lb/>
            chapter at Ouche, and confirmed his grant of all that has <lb/>
            been mentioned, before abbot Mainier, and the convent of <note type="footnote"> 1 Either Tilleul-en-Ange, in the canton of Dive, or Notre-Dame-du <lb/>

            and Walter the provost. These were present when Robert <lb/>
            proceeded to the church, and laid on the altar the charter <lb/>
            containing the grant of these premises.</p>
          <p>I have inserted this short notice of the donations which <lb/>
            the aforesaid lord made to the church of St. Evroult, and <lb/>
            I think the judicious reader will not, on consideration, be <lb/>
            disposed to ridicule me when I conform my narrative, as <lb/>
            occasion offers, to the title of my work.</p>
          <p>Robert, son of Umfrid, came over to England with his <lb/>
            father while he was quite young, and was in the service of <lb/>
            King Edward, both in his household and army, until he was <lb/>
            knighted by that king. Then, newly invested with splendid <lb/>
            armour, and enriched with honourable tokens of the royal <lb/>
            favour, he formed the design of visiting his relations, <lb/>
            and having obtained the king's licence, returned to his <lb/>
            own country radiant with delight. After the battle of <lb/>
            Senlac, while King William was engaged in making head <lb/>
            against repeated insurrections, the young knight, with his <lb/>
            cousin Hugh,2 son of Richard d'Avranches, surnamed Goz, <lb/>
            again came over to England, and distinguished himself in all <lb/>
            the actions where military glory was to be obtained. After <lb/>
            many exploits, he was attached to the service of Hugh before <lb/>
            mentioned, who was made earl of Chester and appointed <lb/>
            Robert commander of his troops, and governor of his whole <lb/>
            province. At that time the Britons on the borders, who <lb/>
            are commonly called Gael, or Welch, took arms with great <lb/>
            fury against Kirtg William and all his adherents; A fortress <lb/>
            was therefore built at Rhuddlan3 by the king's command, to <note type="footnote"> 1 Orgères, near Gacé. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Hugh, viscount d'Avranches in Normandy, and afterwards created <lb/>
            earl of Chester in England, where lie is better known as Hugh Lupus. <lb/>
            His young nephew held by grant under him large possessions, including <lb/>
            two cantrefs in Flintshire or Denbighshire, of which Tegengle was one, <lb/>
            and, in the end, the whole kingdom of Gwyned, or North Wales. He <lb/>
            also held in farm, at forty pounds rent, the capital and royal palace of <lb/>
            Aberfraw in the island of Anglesey. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Rhuddlan, from which he derived his surname, was Robert's principal <lb/>
            seat. It was one of the most important fortresses in Wales, and was often <lb/>
            taken and re-taken in the long succession'of wars from early times. It <lb/>
            was not " built" by Robert, as our author states; he probably added to it, <lb/>
            and strengthened the fortifications. A battle was fought here between the </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            over-awe the Welch, and the custody of it committed to <lb/>
            Robert that he might defend the English frontier against <lb/>
            the inroads of those barbarians. The warlike lord-marcher <lb/>
            had frequent encounters with that turbulent people, in <lb/>
            which much blood was shed. The British inhabitants were, <lb/>
            however, repulsed after some desperate engagements, and <lb/>
            Robert enlarging his territories, erected a strong castle on <lb/>
            mount Diganwy, close to the sea.1 For fifteen years he <lb/>
            severely chastised the Welsh, and seized their territory; <lb/>
            notwithstanding that, proud of their ancient independence, <lb/>
            they had refused all tokens of submission to the Normans. <lb/>
            Making inroads into their country, through woods and <lb/>
            marshes, and over mountain heights, he inflicted losses on <lb/>
            the enemy in every shape. Some he butchered without <lb/>
            mercy, like herds of cattle, as soon as he came up with them. <lb/>
            Others he threw into dungeons, where they suffered a long <lb/>
            imprisonment, or cruelly subjected them to a shameful <lb/>
            slavery. It is not fit that Christians should so oppress their <lb/>
            brethren who have been regenerated by holy baptism in the <lb/>
            faith of Christ.</p>
          <p>Ambition and avarice, those mainsprings of human <lb/>
            action in every part of the world, were the powerful stimu­ <lb/>
            lants which urged Robert, the lord-marcher, to the indis­ <lb/>
            criminate pillage and slaughter which afterwards plunged <lb/>
            him into the pit of destruction. It happened that, on the <lb/>
            third of July, Gryffyth, king of Wales,' came to land with <note type="footnote"> Saxons and Welsh as early as 795, on occasion of which a plaintive air <lb/>
            was composed by the bards called Morfa Rhuddlan, or the Red Marsh, <lb/>
            which is still played with enthusiasm by the national harpers. Camden <lb/>
            says that the castle was built by Llewellyn-ap Sylt in 1015, or 1020, and <lb/>
            became the palace of the Welsh princes. It was burnt down by Harold <lb/>
            during his irruption into Wales in 1063, being then, as the Saxon Chronicle <lb/>
            says, King Gryffyth's. It having been again occupied by the Welsh, Robert <lb/>
            re-took it, and by command of the Conqueror restored and fortified it, as we <lb/>
            have already seen. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Diganwy, which stood on the heights commanding the entrance of the <lb/>
            river Cunway, was also a very ancient fortress. It is supposed to have <lb/>
            been the Roman station Dictum, and is mentioned in the Welsh Chronicles <lb/>
            as early as 810. It was, therefore, only restored and strengthened by <lb/>
            Robert de Rhuddlan. Conway Castle, which stands on the opposite or <lb/>
            western bank of the river, was not built till 1284. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gryffyth-ap-Conan, king of North Wales, was engaged in a continual <lb/>
            contest for the defence of his kingdom and independence. This is not the <lb/>
            only instance of his daring enterprises against Robert of Rhuddlan. The <lb/>
            Norman lord, on one occasion, received a visit from the Welsh prince to </note> <pb n="446"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. CH.III. </note> <lb/>
            three ships under a mountain called Horma-heva,1 and the <lb/>
            band of pirates presently spread itself over the country for <lb/>
            pillage, like ravening wolves. Meanwhile, the tide ebbed, <lb/>
            and the ships were left dry on the beach; Gryffyth and his <lb/>
            followers scouring the coast and carrying off men and cattle, <lb/>
            with which they made a hasty retreat to their vessels thus <lb/>
            lying on the strand.</p>
          <p>Under these circumstances, Robert was roused from his <lb/>
            noon-day sleep by the people's cries, which made him aware of <lb/>
            this hostile inroad on his territories. He sprung up quickly, <lb/>
            unarmed as he was, and without delay despatched messen­ <lb/>
            gers to summon his vassals to arms through all the district. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, he pursued the Welsh, without further prepa­ <lb/>
            ration, at the head of a few soldiers, and reaching the top of <lb/>
            mount Horma-heva, which is very lofty, saw, beneath, the <lb/>
            pirates binding the captives and driving them to their ships <lb/>
            with the cattle. Upon this, the noble lord-marcher, bold as <lb/>
            a lion, shouted aloud to his small band of followers, few and <lb/>
            unarmed as they were, calling on them to rush on the <lb/>
            Welsh on the dry sands before the return of the tide. They <lb/>
            however excused themselves on account of their scanty <lb/>
            numbers and the difficulty of descending the precipitous <lb/>
            face of the mountain. Upon this, Robert, who saw that <lb/>
            the enemy was only waiting the return of the sea to make <lb/>
            their escape, was overwhelmed with grief, and impatient of <lb/>
            delay, scrambled down the mountain side to throw himself <lb/>
            on the enemy without armour and with only one follower, <lb/>
            a man-at-arms whose name was Osbern d'Orgères. Seeing <lb/>
            him coming to attack them, protected by his shield only and <lb/>
            supported by a single soldier, the Welsh in a body hurled <lb/>
            their spears at him, and, piercing the shield with the insup­ <lb/>
            portable weight, mortally wounded the brave Osbern. But as <lb/>
            long as Robert was able to stand and clasp his shield, no one <lb/>
            ventured to come to close quarters and attack him sword in­ <lb/>
            hand. At length the intrepid warrior fell on his knees, <lb/>
            pierced with darts, and his strength failing, the shield, heavy <note type="footnote"> ask his aid, which was granted; but on some quarrel, Gryffyth attacked <lb/>
            him in his own castle, took and burnt the bailey or yard, and killed such a <lb/>
            number of his men that very few escaped into the tower. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Th e lofty promontory, conspicuous from the Ainai Straits and the <lb/>
            Irish Channel, which forms the extreme north-west of Carnarvonshire, and <lb/>

             <pb n="447"/>
            with the weight which clung to it, dropped from his hand; <lb/>
            and he commended his soul to the Almighty and St. Mary, <lb/>
            mother of God. Then the whole band rushed on him, and <lb/>
            cutting off his head in the sight of his people, fixed it at the <lb/>
            mast-head as a trophy of their victory. Many witnessed <lb/>
            this spectacle from the summit of the mountain with grief <lb/>
            and rage, but they were unable to render their lord any <lb/>
            succour. At last the country people flocked in from the <lb/>
            whole district; but it was too late; they were unable to <lb/>
            save their lord-marcher, who was already slain. However, <lb/>
            they manned some ships and pursued the pirates, as they <lb/>
            were making their course over the sea, in a tumult of grief <lb/>
            at seeing their lord's head carried off on the mast of the <lb/>
            enemy's ship. Gryffyth and his crew, finding that they were <lb/>
            chased, and observing that their pursuers' rage was inflamed <lb/>
            by the insult to their lord, took down his head from the <lb/>
            mast and threw it into the sea. On seeing this, Robert's <lb/>
            followers ceased the fruitless chace. His body was lifted <lb/>
            from the sea-shore with loud lamentations both of the English <lb/>
            and Normans, and being carried to Chester, was buried in <lb/>
            the abbey of St. Werburgh the virgin. That monastery <lb/>
            had been lately built by Hugh, earl of Chester, who, ap­ <lb/>
            pointing Richard, a monk of Bee, abbot there, established <lb/>
            a body of men devoted to the service of God in the midst of <lb/>
            the brutish bands of that border fortress.1</p>
          <p>Some years afterwards, Arnold the monk, son of Umfrid, <lb/>
            crossed over to England, and, with the licence of Robert de <lb/>
            Limesi,'bishop of Lichfield,2 took up his brother's remains <lb/>
            and transferred them to the abbey of St.Evroult in Normandy. <lb/>
            They were received with due honours by Abbot Roger and <lb/>
            the convent of monks, and interred in the monks' cloister on <lb/>
            the south side of the church. This Arnold, with four noble <lb/>
            companions, Guy, Roger, Dreux, and Odo, quitted the mili­ <lb/>
            tary service in his youth, and becoming a monk, laboured <lb/>

            order, which he performed zealously for almost fifty years. <lb/>
            He devoted himself to promote the interests of his abbey, <lb/>
            for which he several times crossed the British sea, as well <lb/>
            as penetrated into Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, that he <lb/>
            might procure supplies for the monastery from the gifts of <lb/>
            his relations. In these journeys he visited his brother <lb/>
            William, who was abbot of St. Euphemia, and William de <lb/>
            Grantmesnil his cousin,1 as well as other wealthy relations <lb/>
            in Italy, and by a gentle violence carried off all he could to <lb/>
            enrich his own abbey. In this way he procured from his <lb/>
            kinsmens' stores ornaments and other things required for <lb/>
            his own church, making his kindred subservient to the de­ <lb/>
            mands of the abbey. He had to bear many slights and <lb/>
            rebuffs on several occasions, but he was not to be deterred <lb/>
            from his undertaking by the obstacles which he sometimes, <lb/>
            indeed frequently, met with. Nothing induced him to relax <lb/>
            his zeal in the cause he espoused ; and it was at his charge <lb/>
            that the arch of stone, which is still standing, was built over <lb/>

            What though a stormy life he led, <lb/>
            The fierce lord-marcher bowed his head <lb/>

          <p>WHILE William Rufus, having established his authority <lb/>
            through all parts of England, was employed in keeping <lb/>
            down the insurgents by the strong hand of his princely <lb/>
            power, the ambitious Odo, banished from England, betook <lb/>
            himself to his diocese of Bayeux, and finding duke Robert <lb/>
            sunk in slothful ease, set himself to acquire the mastery <lb/>
            over the whole of Normandy. The entire province was in a <lb/>
            state of dissolution; bands of freebooters overran the vil­ <lb/>
            lages and country-side, and the unarmed peasantry were <lb/>
            every where at the mercy of thieves and robbers. Duke <lb/>
            Robert imposed no restraint upon the evil-doers, who, for <lb/>
            eight years under that feeble-minded prince, vented their <lb/>
            fury on the defenceless people. They harassed without <lb/>
            remorse, even holy church, and wrung from her by force of <lb/>
            arms, or devastated, the possessions with which she had been <pb n="451"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1088.] </note> <lb/>
            endowed by their worthy ancestors. The monasteries were <lb/>
            full of grief at their desolation, and the monks and nuns <lb/>
            were reduced to penury.1 In the midst of these pestilent <lb/>
            disorders, no honour was shown to persons and things dedi­ <lb/>
            cated to God; no respect. Fire, robbery and homicide <lb/>
            were matters of daily occurrence, and the people were over­ <lb/>
            whelmed with calamities and trouble. Normandy gave birth <lb/>
            to wicked sons, who abandoned themselves to every sort of <lb/>
            crime, and cruelly devoured their mother's bowels. The <lb/>
            Venus of Sodom stalked boldly in the midst of such scenes <lb/>
            with her wanton enticements, defiling the effeminate, who <lb/>
            were only fit to be burnt. The marriage bed was polluted <lb/>
            by open adultery, and every part of the divine law was en­ <lb/>
            tirely neglected. The bishops excommunicated the outlaws <lb/>
            by their divine authority, and theologians gave the warnings <lb/>
            of God to the guilty in their discourses; but vain were all <lb/>
            these against the irresistible influence of pride and avarice, <lb/>
            and the vices which follow in their train. Strong places <lb/>
            were every where constructed without lawful authority, <lb/>
            where the sons of robbers were nourished like wolves' whelps <lb/>
            to mangle sheep. The malignants sought causes of offence, <lb/>
            that in their mutual quarrels they might have opportunities <lb/>
            of resorting to places in the neighbourhood, and that burn­ <lb/>
            ings and plunderings might result from their enterprises. <lb/>
            The depopulated country and crowds of widows and in­ <lb/>
            firm persons, lamenting the calamities brought upon them, <lb/>
            are witnesses to this day of the truth of my statements. <lb/>
            Thus quickly vanished and fell into decay, confusion, and <lb/>
            disgrace, through the sloth of the careless duke, all that had <lb/>
            Deen created by the vigour and ability of a wise prince and <lb/>
            nis assistants, and had long flourished in Normandy.</p>
          <p>In the course of the summer, as soon as certain intelli­ <lb/>
            gence of the surrender of Rochester was received beyond <lb/>
            sea, Henry, the heir-apparent, now count of the Cotentin, <lb/>

            investiture of his mother's domains. King William received <lb/>
            him graciously as became a brother, and granted him frater. <lb/>
            nally all that it was in his power to bestow. Having accom. <lb/>
            plished his business, in autumn he took leave of the king, <lb/>
            and embarked on his return to Normandy, with Robert de <lb/>
            Belèsme, who, through the mediation of powerful friends, had <lb/>
            made his peace with the king. Meanwhile, their arrival had <lb/>
            been anticipated by certain malevolent sowers of discord <lb/>
            who mix falsehood with truth, and who sent tidings to duke <lb/>
            Robert that his brother Henry, and Robert de Belèsme had <lb/>
            not only made peace with the Red King, but had also bound <lb/>
            themselves by an oath to the duke's disadvantage. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence, the duke knowing them to be powerful and valiant <lb/>
            knights, and being in great fear of their enterprises, took <lb/>
            counsel with the bishop of Bayeux, and caused them to bE <lb/>
            arrested. Before they could undertake anything, and while <lb/>
            landing in security from their ships on the sea shore, they <lb/>
            were seized and fettered, and committed to the custody <lb/>
            of the tyrannical bishop, one at Bayeux, the other at <lb/>
            Neuilly. When Roger, earl of Shrewsbury, heard that his <lb/>
            son Robert was a prisoner, he hastened over to Normandy <lb/>
            having obtained the king's licence, and put all his castles in <lb/>
            a state of defence against the duke. But Odo, of Bayeux. <lb/>
            like a dragon struck to the earth and vomiting flames, and <lb/>
            full of rage at the haughty treatment he had received from <lb/>
            the king, raised all sorts of commotions in Normandy, that <lb/>
            by some means or other he might foment evil to his nephew <lb/>
            by whom he had been disgracefully expelled. The duke was <lb/>
            much afraid of him, and followed his advice in some things <lb/>
            while he made light of it in others.</p>

          <p>THE malcontents in Normandy being every where in arms, <lb/>
            and threatening more mischief, the turbulent bishop Ode <lb/>
            came to the duke at Rouen, and reviewing the state of <lb/>
            the country at large thus addressed him :—" Whoever would <lb/>
            worthily govern the state, and rule the people of God <lb/>
            among whom there is so much diversity of conduct, should <lb/>
            be both gentle and severe, according to circumstances. He <pb n="453"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1088.] </note> <lb/>
            should be gentle as a lamb to the good, the submissive, and <lb/>
            the humble ; fierce as a lion to the wicked, the rebellious and <lb/>
            the proud. Consider this well, my lord the duke, that you may <lb/>
            well govern this noble duchy of Normandy, which, by the <lb/>
            grace of God, you have inherited from your ancestors. <lb/>
            Take courage, and act with firmness. You see that mis­ <lb/>
            creants and outlaws are revelling throughout the land, more <lb/>
            like Pagans than Christians in their evil courses, and, if I may <lb/>
            be permitted to say so, equalling the former in the enormity <lb/>
            of their crimes. The monks and the widows cry to you, <lb/>
            and you sleep. Unutterable delinquencies are frequently <lb/>
            reported to you, and you make light of them. It was not <lb/>
            thus that holy David, and the great Alexander acted: not <lb/>
            thus, Julius Cæsar and Severus,1 the African; not thus <lb/>
            Hannibal the Carthaginian, Scipio Africanus, Cyrus the <lb/>
            Persian, and Marius the Roman. But I waste time in <lb/>
            mentioning barbarians, whose very names are unknown to <lb/>
            you. Let us turn to those which are more familiar, and <lb/>
            belong to our own race. Think of your fathers and fore­ <lb/>
            fathers, whose firmness of mind and courage made them <lb/>
            formidable to the warlike race of the French. I speak of <lb/>
            Rolio, William Long-sword, the three Richards, your grand­ <lb/>
            father Robert, and lastly, your father, William, who was <lb/>
            more illustrious than all his predecessors, I beseech you to <lb/>
            emulate their firmness and ability, as they inherited the <lb/>
            vigour and industry of their ancestors, who by their pro­ <lb/>
            digious exertions, became arbiters of the fate of kingdoms, <lb/>
            put tyrants under their yoke, and subdued barbarous nations. <lb/>
            Rouse yourself, and, assembling the invincible army of Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, lead it to the city of Nantes. There is a garrison of <lb/>
            your own soldiers in the citadel which your father built, <lb/>
            and the whole city, with the venerable Hoel, the bishop, <lb/>
            render you willing homage. Summon all the leading men <lb/>
            of Maine to attend you there, and receive graciously, and <lb/>
            address courteously, those who obey your summons; but <lb/>
            take arms against such as treat it with contempt, and lose <lb/>
            no time in besieging their castles if they do not surrender <lb/>
            them. Having secured the submission of the people of <lb/>

            Lord. Carry yourself manfully, and be guided by the <lb/>
            counsels of the wise. Already you have in prison Robert, <lb/>
            earl Roger's eldest son, and if you make a bold effort, <lb/>
            such as becomes a brave prince, it is in your power utterly <lb/>
            to expel that disloyal family of Talvas from your duchy. It is <lb/>
            a cursed race; it breeds mischief, and contrives it as their <lb/>
            inheritance. This is proved by their horrible ends ; death <lb/>
            coming upon none of them in the ordinary course of nature. <lb/>
            This family of Talvas,1 if it be not now extirpated, will, in <lb/>
            my opinion, yet prove very troublesome to you, and even <lb/>
            irresistible. They hold a number of the strongest fortresses, <lb/>
            Belèsme, Lursou, Essai, Alençon, Domfront, St. Ceneri, La <lb/>
            Roche d'Igé, for which the bold Hugh assassinated Ma­ <lb/>
            bel,2 and Vignas, with many more stately castles, built by <lb/>
            William de Belèsme, Robert, Ivo and Warin, and their suc­ <lb/>
            cessors, or which they wrested from their lawful owners or <lb/>
            their neighbours, either by force or stratagem. Their whole <lb/>
            conduct has been steeped in fraud and crime, nor have they <lb/>
            ever kept faith with any one with whom they were con­ <lb/>
            nected by the ties of friendship, or alliance. They have <lb/>
            prospered by getting rid of their unsuspecting neighbours <lb/>
            by death or captivity, and their stately houses and strong <lb/>
            fortifications have been built at the expense of the blood of <lb/>
            the peasants. Now is your opportunity, most noble duke, <lb/>
            for stripping them of these strongholds with perfect justice, <lb/>
            if you will only resolutely follow the example of your mag­ <lb/>
            nanimous father and his great actions. As for him, he was <lb/>
            master of all these fortresses as long as he lived, and com­ <lb/>
            mitted the custody of them to those he thought fit. But <lb/>
            this Robert, as soon as he received intelligence of the king's <lb/>
            death, arrogantly expelled your own garrisons from your own <lb/>
            castles, and disinherited you by getting them into his own <lb/>
            power. Reflect wisely on what I have said, and like a good <lb/>

          <p>The bishop's exhortations were cordially approved by all <lb/>
            who were present, and they cheerfully placed themselves at <lb/>
            the duke's disposal for the defence of the country. Duke <lb/>
            Robert therefore, having assembled troops, led them to <lb/>
            Mantes, where be was received with joy, both by the clergy <lb/>
            and citizens. On hearing his messages, Geoffery de <lb/>
            Mayenne,1 Robert the Burgundian,2 Elias son of John,3 and <lb/>
            many others came and offered their services to the Duke. <lb/>
            The Norman troops were under the command of the bishop <lb/>
            of Bayeux, William count of Evreux, Ralph de Conches, <lb/>
            and his nephew, William de Breteuil,4 and many other <lb/>
            knights of distinguished merit. Paganus de Montdoubleau <lb/>
            with other malcontents held possession of the castle of Bal- <lb/>
            Ion, and made an obstinate resistance, when the duke and <lb/>
            his army proceeded to invest it. In that engagement, Os­ <lb/>
            mund de Gasprée, a handsome and honourable knight was <lb/>
            slain on the calends [1st] of September. His body was <lb/>
            brought to St. Evroult by the monk Arnold, and buried in <lb/>
            the porch before the church door.</p>
          <p>After many losses on both sides, the garrison of Ballon <lb/>
            made peace with the duke, and afterwards the united forces <lb/>
            of the Normans and Manceaux, under the duke's command, <lb/>
            laid siege to the castle of St. Céneri. The family of Robert <note type="footnote"> 1 Geoffrey, lord of Mayenne (1059—1099). See vol. i. p. 449. He <lb/>

            to the keeping of Robert Quarrel, a knight of great spirit <lb/>
            and resolution, who was encouraged by Earl Roger to offer <lb/>
            a determined resistance to the besiegers; but their pro­ <lb/>
            visions tailing the castle was taken, and by order of the <lb/>
            enraged duke, Robert Quarrel, the governor, was deprived <lb/>
            of sight. Many others also, who had joined in the obstinate <lb/>
            resistance to the Norman prince, suffered mutilation of <lb/>
            their limbs by a judgment of his court.</p>
          <p>Then Geoffrey of Mayenne, with the lords of that pro­ <lb/>
            vince, sought an audience with the duke, and presented to <lb/>
            him Robert Giroie, son of Robert Giroie.1 " This man, <lb/>
            my lord duke," said Geoffrey, " is your cousin, and has <lb/>
            long dwelt in Apulia with your kinsmen, who are very pow­ <lb/>
            erful in that country. He now comes, in full confidence, to <lb/>
            you, his lord and cousin, offering you his fealty and service, <lb/>
            and demanding this castle as his right, his father having <lb/>
            held it all his life by inheritance, and died there." Duke <lb/>
            Robert readily granted this claim, and restored the castle of <lb/>
            St. Ceneri to Robert Giroie. He held it for nearly thirty- <lb/>
            six years afterwards, and fortified it with walls, and ditches, <lb/>
            and watch-towers. At his death he left it to his sons, <lb/>
            William and Robert.</p>
          <p>The inhabitants of this place seldom enjoyed any peace <lb/>
            or respite from the attacks of the Normans and Manceaux. <lb/>
            The rocky hill on which it stands is surrounded on three <lb/>
            sides by the windings of the Sarthe. St. Generic, the ve­ <lb/>
            nerable confessor,2 dwelt there in the time of Milehard, <lb/>
            bishop of Séez. He founded there a convent of monks, be­ <lb/>
            coming the Lord's soldier among the noble company, and <lb/>
            after a well-spent life, departed in Christ happily on the <lb/>
            nones [7th] of May. At length, in the reign of Charles the <lb/>
            Simple, at the time Hasting the Dane, with his heathen <lb/>
            band, was ravaging Neustria, the holy remains were trans­ <lb/>

            the end. It is reported that one hundred and forty monks <lb/>
            laboured there in the vineyard of the Lord of Sabaoth. <lb/>
            Their grave-stones in the church, and all around, bear open <lb/>
            testimony to travellers of the worth and reverence of the <lb/>
            men who there lie buried. The miscreants who succeeded <lb/>
            them in their habitation suffered, as they deserved, many <lb/>
            calamities ; fires, massacres, and numberless other miseries, <lb/>
            being their frequent lot.</p>
          <p>The garrisons of Alençon, Belèsme, and other fortresses, <lb/>
            hearing of the sad fate of Robert Quarrel and his comrades, <lb/>
            were much terrified, and consulted together on the pro­ <lb/>
            priety of surrendering the castles on the duke's approach. <lb/>
            But Robert's exhibition of spirit quickly failed, and his love <lb/>
            of ease and quiet soon led him to terminate the campaign, <lb/>
            disbanding his army, and suffering each man to depart to his <lb/>
            own home.</p>
          <p>Earl Roger was much delighted at the dissolution of the <lb/>
            united forces of Normandy and Maine, and sent fair-speak­ <lb/>
            ing envoys to the duke demanding peace and his son's <lb/>
            release, with many empty promises. The duke, who was <lb/>
            imprudent aud fickle, easy to be persuaded, and lax in the <lb/>
            execution of justice, accepted unexpectedly the frivolous <lb/>
            offers of his disloyal vassals, making peace with Earl Roger, <lb/>
            and granting his demands, and releasing Robert de Belèsme <lb/>
            from confinement. But as soon as he had obtained his <lb/>
            liberty he became more insolent than ever, paid little atten­ <lb/>
            tion to the orders or threats of the duke, and, mindful of <lb/>
            the affront he had received, took a long and multiplied venge­ <lb/>
            ance for his wrongs. In fact, during the fifteen years he <lb/>
            and the duke remained afterwards in Normandy together,1 <lb/>
            his rage was unbounded, and he was seldom at a loss for <lb/>
            opportunities to raise commotions in the province. By his <lb/>
            crafty devices he drew over to his side many of the duke's <lb/>
            servants and adherents, and lessened the domains which his <lb/>
            predecessors had possessed and largely augmented. Robert <note type="footnote"> 1 This calculation is not exact, the two Roberts were only fourteen <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.YIII. CH.V. </note> <lb/>
            Belèsme1 was of a subtle genius, deceitful and wily: in <lb/>
            person he was stout and of great strength; intrepid and <lb/>
            formidable in war ; he was a fluent speaker, but desperately <lb/>
            cruel ; his avarice and lust were insatiable ; lie was an able <lb/>
            manager of important affairs, and toiled with the utmost <lb/>
            patience through the greatest worldly trials; he displayed <lb/>
            great skill in constructing buildings and machines and <lb/>
            other difficult works, and inexorable cruelty in tormenting <lb/>
            his enemies. He did not honour, cherish, and clothe holy <lb/>
            church as a son should a mother, but dishonoured, op­ <lb/>
            pressed, and stripped it as a step-son would treat his <lb/>
            mother-in-law. After numberless offences and traitorous <lb/>
            conspiracies, King Henry, by God's judgment, has most <lb/>
            righteously committed him to close confinement, having <lb/>
            thus made himself the stern avenger of the wretched under <lb/>
            the special influence of divine revelation. But we shall <lb/>
            speak of this in another place.</p>
          <p>This lord, with the assistance of King William, by whom <lb/>
            he was much beloved for his father's and mother s (Roger <lb/>
            and Mabel) sake, obtained for wife a daughter of Guy, <lb/>
            count of Ponthieu, Agnes by name; he had by her a son <lb/>
            called William, who inherited their large domains scattered <lb/>
            through Normandy and Ponthieu. By means not only of <lb/>
            his wealth but his domineering spirit, Robert established his <lb/>
            pre-eminence over all his brothers, and, disinheriting them, <lb/>
            usurped the entire patrimony of their ancestors both in <lb/>
            Normandy and the county of Maine, of which for a long <lb/>
            period he had sole possession. He used his utmost efforts <lb/>
            to reduce to subjection the lords of his neighbourhood, his <lb/>
            equals in birth, and with some, actuated by his insatiable <lb/>
            ambition, he succeeded, either by treachery and insupport­ <lb/>
            able hostilities, or by insidious attacks. This was the case <note type="footnote"> 1 The character of this extraordinary man, whose great talents dis. <lb/>
            tinguished him from most of the turbulent nobles of this age, seems to <lb/>
            have inspired all the contemporary historians with horror. Henry of <lb/>
            Huntingdon says, " He was a very Pluto, Megæra , Cerberus, or anything <lb/>
            you can conceive still more horrible," and gives details of his cruelties <lb/>
            which are omitted by Ordericus. William of Malmesbury particularly <lb/>
            enlarges on the powers of dissimulation, by means of which his victims <lb/>
            became his prey. Huntingdon's Letter to Warin on the Illustrious Men <lb/>

            with Hugh de Nonant,1 Paganus,2 and Robert de St. Generic <lb/>
            Bernard de la Perté,4 and several others whom he frequently <lb/>
            troubled, terrified, and perplexed in various ways. Many he <lb/>
            humbled by seizing their domains and burning their castles, <lb/>
            or reduced them to the utmost poverty by- ravaging their <lb/>
            lands, or, what was worse, he made them worthless by maiming <lb/>
            their limbs, so that they became halt and lame, or by depriving <lb/>
            them of sight. By such tyranny of the cruel lord-marcher <lb/>
            while he was aiming to crush all his neighbours, the wretched <lb/>
            country was- reduced to desolation ; they, on the other hand, <lb/>
            proud of their nobility, which was equal to his, defending <lb/>
            to death their former independence. Thus immense inju­ <lb/>
            ries were constantly inflicted, loss beng added to loss, either <lb/>
            through revenge or covetousness, until the people of the <lb/>
            country were threatened with want.</p>
          <p>Geoffrey, soil of Rotro, count de Mortagne, took up arms <lb/>
            against Robert, and set fire to Echaufour5 and several other <lb/>
            villages around, from which he swept off much booty, and made <lb/>
            many prisoners. This count was magnanimous, handsome, and <lb/>
            strong ; he feared God, was a devout friend of the church, a <lb/>
            staunch protector of the clergy and poor ; in peace, he was <lb/>
            gentle and courteous, and of most obliging manners ; in war <lb/>
            he was powerful and successful, and became formidable to <lb/>
            the neighbouring princes, who were all his enemies. The <lb/>
            nobility of his own birth, and that of his own wife Beatrice, <lb/>
            rendered him illustrious above all his compeers; and he had <lb/>
            among his subjects warlike barons and brave governors of <lb/>
            castles. He gave his daughters in marriage to men of the <lb/>
            rank of counts: Margaret, to Henry earl of Warwick,6 and <lb/>
            Juliana to Gilbert de Laigle,7 from whom sprung a noble <lb/>
            race of handsome children. The glory of Count Geoffrey <lb/>
            was exalted by such a progeny, and he maintained it by his <note type="footnote"> 1 Nonant, a bourg to the north of Séez. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The family of Paganel were lords of Hauterive, near Alençon. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This person must be Robert Giroie, oftened mentioned by Ordericus, <lb/>

            valour and courage, his wealth and alliances. Above all, <lb/>
            having the fear of God, he feared no man, but marched <lb/>
            boldly, with a lion's port. Laying claim to the strong castle of <lb/>
            Domfront and other domains, as his right, he endeavoured <lb/>
            to dispossess his cousin Robert of them. He was grieved <lb/>
            to harass the unarmed and innocent, but he could not <lb/>
            bring the public enemy with whom he had a just quarrel to <lb/>
            a fair field for deciding it. Robert de Belèsme, who was the <lb/>
            terror of so many others, was not the less in constant appre­ <lb/>
            hension of them, and did not dare to join issue with his adver­ <lb/>
            sary in open fight. He therefore prudently skulked within. <lb/>
            the shelter of his fortifications, and even permitted, with <lb/>
            regret, freebooters to ravage his territories, rather than ven­ <lb/>
            ture to march against them, brave as he was. For, in his <lb/>
            extreme caution, he was apprehensive that if he took the <lb/>
            field, his own vassals might leave him in the enemy's hands. <lb/>
            In consequence, the quarrel between the two lords-marchers <lb/>
            was long protracted, and was the cause of severe losses and <lb/>
            much bloodshed among their dependants. There were <lb/>
            similar germs of evil among the nobles in other parts of <lb/>
            Normandy, which growing to a head, produced a fruitful <lb/>
            crop of tragic occurrences.</p>

          <p>WHILE Normandy under an inert prince was a prey in <lb/>

            lords, and the peaceful sons of the church, exposed to the <lb/>

            vented their sorrow in groans and sighs, the merciful Ruler <lb/>
            of mankind took pity on his servants, and snatched some of <lb/>
            his veteran followers from the lake of misery and valley of <lb/>
            tears, the abode of mortals, and, as we believe, enrolled them <lb/>
            in the company of those who had been their fellow soldiers <lb/>
            in the same service, among the delights of the blessed <lb/>
            paradise.</p>
          <p>Thus Durand, the aged abbot of Troarn, who had been a <lb/>
            monk from his childhood, and was celebrated for his piety <lb/>
            and wisdom-a doctor of great skill in church music, and of <lb/>

            to others-took to his bed after long labours in the worship <lb/>
            of God, and having well prepared himself, like a prudent <lb/>
            and faithful servant, for going worthily to his court, he <lb/>
            departed out of this life on the the third of the ides [the <lb/>
            11th] of February. At his death, an extraordinary circum­ <lb/>
            stance occurred. The corpse appeared to be of two colours ; <lb/>
            the left side of the face, and the whole body down to the <lb/>
            feet, were of a snowy whiteness: the right side was of a <lb/>
            leaden hue, which entirely tinged that half of the corpse <lb/>
            from the crown of the head to the feet, while the other be­ <lb/>
            came white. This unusual appearance of different shades of <lb/>
            colour struck the beholders with terror, and supplied those <lb/>
            who studiously inquired into the cause of such a phenome­ <lb/>
            non an opportunity of exhibiting their subtlety in specu­ <lb/>
            lation. Some said one thing, some another. It is not my <lb/>
            business to insert in this short account all the clever ob­ <lb/>
            servations which were made in abundance. Some, indeed <lb/>
            interpreted the difference between the left and the right, as <lb/>
            that of the active and contemplative, or the present and <lb/>
            future, life. Others thought that the prodigy was a sign of <lb/>
            future events.</p>
          <p>Durand's devout disciples reverently buried the corpse <lb/>
            of their pious master in the chapter, and inscribed the <lb/>
            following epitaph ou a white stone which covered the <lb/>
            grave :— <lb/>

            His life of bliss began, his earthly labours ceased. <lb/>

            and his excellent example. The twomonasteries just named <lb/>
            were founded by one nobleman, and drew from one source <lb/>
            their usages in divine service, and their monastic discipline. <lb/>
            For Roger de Montgomery established the convents of <lb/>
            monks in both, and the abbey of Féchamp supplied the <lb/>
            the rules for their regular life. The two societies were <lb/>
            united by a mutual regard, and they were both under the <lb/>
            protection of the miracle-working Martin, archbishop of <lb/>
            Tours. The monks of Séez received their first abbot from <lb/>
            the brethren of Troarn,1 and now in his life-time sought a <lb/>
            return of the favour in the person of one of his disciples. <lb/>
            They returned thanks to God for the superior that was sent <lb/>
            them, and profited much by the talents of the good shep­ <lb/>

            bishop of Ostia, pope, by the name of Urban. The God of <lb/>

            him the tower of David with its bulwarks against the side <lb/>

            fair words or persecution drew all he could from the unity <lb/>
            of peace to join in his schism.5 Odo, count of Sutri,6 was <lb/>

            learned, as well as fluent of speech and good humoured, he <lb/>
            was generally liked. In his youth he quitted a distin­ <lb/>
            guished family to enter on a monastic life, and humbly <lb/>
            served ten years, through the various degrees in the offices <lb/>
            which fell to the monks. At last, in his eleventh year, he <lb/>
            succeeded to the government of the abbey by the command <lb/>
            of Girard, bishop of Séez, who consecrated him; and he <lb/>
            administered it piously for sixteen years, while the storms <lb/>
            of war were raging around. With God's help, he diligently <lb/>
            increased the possessions of the church, as far as the times <lb/>
            permitted. But he was compelled to take refuge in Eng­ <lb/>
            land from the increasing severities of Robert de Belèsme, <lb/>
            and was retained there by King Henry, who treated him <lb/>
            with great respect, and through bishop Gundulph, raised <lb/>
            him to the see of Rochester. Some years afterwards he <lb/>
            was promoted to succeed the venerable archbishop Anselm, <lb/>
            and presided over the metropolitan see of Canterbury nine <lb/>
            years.</p>

            learning. Inflated with ambition to raise himself above <lb/>
            the eminent men who adorned the court of the great king <lb/>
            William, he undertook many things without orders, and of <lb/>
            which that prince was ignorant, making impertinent and <lb/>
            vexatious accusations in the king's court, and arro­ <lb/>
            gantly over-awing his superiors as if he was supported by <lb/>
            the royal authority. In consequence Robert, the king's <lb/>
            steward,1 gave him the surname of Flambard, which, indeed, <lb/>
            prophetically suited his genius and conduct; for, like a <lb/>

            daily chants of the church into lamentations, by the new <lb/>
            practices he introduced into the country. He disquieted <lb/>
            the young king by his perfidious suggestions, recommending <lb/>
            him to revise the record which had been taken of all pro­ <lb/>
            perty throughout England, and, making a new division of <lb/>
            the lands, to deprive his subjects, both native and alien <lb/>
            of all that exceeded a certain amount. Having obtained <lb/>
            the king's consent, he had all the plough-lands, which are <lb/>
            called in English hides,2 accurately measured and registered, <lb/>
            and setting aside the larger admeasurement which the <lb/>
            liberal-minded English had made use of by order of king <lb/>
            Edward, and lessening the estates of the farmers, aug­ <lb/>
            mented the royal revenues. By this diminution of the <lb/>
            former extent of their estates, and the heavy burdens of new <lb/>
            and increased taxation, he shamefully oppressed the king's <lb/>
            faithful and humble subjects, impoverishing them, by the <lb/>
            loss of their property, and reducing them from affluence to <lb/>
            great indigence.</p>
          <p>By Ralph's advice, the young king, on the death of the <lb/>
            prelates, took their churches with the domains attached to <lb/>
            them from ancient times, into his own hands, and set his <lb/>
            courtiers over the convents of monks, and the deans and <lb/>

            other princes, as well as their great nobles. They indeed, <lb/>
            having been converted to the faith, devoutly worshipped God, <lb/>
            and out of their abundance made large endowments on the <lb/>
            monks and clergy, that those special servants of the Divine <lb/>
            law might enjoy ample means of subsistence, and be able day <lb/>
            and night, without hindrance, to perform cheerfully the offices <lb/>
            of divine worship, and keep perpetually the appointed vigils <lb/>
            in places consecrated to the service of God. Thither pil­ <lb/>
            grims and wayfarers resorted in security, and there found a <lb/>
            short repose after their fatigues, and, according to the fun­ <lb/>
            damental institutions of such places, a plentiful repast, after <lb/>
            their privations. Returning thanks to God for such unex­ <lb/>
            pected refreshment, they offered devout prayers to the Creator <lb/>
            of all things for the benefactors, long since departed, who <lb/>
            had secured them the enjoyment of such privileges.1</p>
          <p>Before the Norman conquest, it was the practice in Eng­ <lb/>
            land, on the death of the superiors of monasteries,2 for the <lb/>
            bishop in whose diocese they were to take an accurate ac­ <lb/>
            count of the possessions of the convents, and become their <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author has drawn in this passage a pleasing picture of monastic <lb/>

            own opinion, however, is, from the sequel of the passage, that Ordericus <lb/>
            intended thus to designate the abbots and priors, who administered the <lb/>
            government of the monasteries; the revenues of which must have been <lb/>
            more tempting objects, and called for a more especial guardianship in those <lb/>
            days, than the tithes or other endowments of the parochial clergy. </note> <pb n="469"/>

            guardians until the new abbots were canonically ordained. <lb/>
            In like manner, on the death of a bishop, the archbishop took <lb/>
            charge of the property of the see, and, with the advice of the <lb/>
            officers of the church, appropriated it either to the relief of <lb/>
            the poor, the repair of churches, or other pious uses. Wil­ <lb/>
            liam Rufus, in the beginning of his reign, was induced by <lb/>
            Flambard to abolish this custom, so that he suffered the <lb/>
            metropolitan see of Canterbury to remain vacant three <lb/>
            years,1 and seized its revenues for his own use. It is evi­ <lb/>
            dently unjust and contrary to all reason that what has been <lb/>
            devoted to God by the liberality of pious kings, or laudably <lb/>
            acquired by the stewards of the property of the church <lb/>
            should fall again into lay hands, and be iniquitously devoted <lb/>
            to secular uses. Nor can we doubt that as, on the one hand, <lb/>
            those who have consecrated to God part of their wealth have <lb/>
            received from Him the just reward of their good deeds; so, <lb/>
            on the other, sacrilegious intruders into sacred things will <lb/>
            be brought to punishment by the avenging hand of God, and <lb/>
            stripped of the possessions they have usurped to their eternal <lb/>
            disgrace. Such is the Almighty's sure and immutable law. <lb/>
            Recompense is graciously promised to righteous doers, while <lb/>
            transgressors are threatened with fearful vengeance for their <lb/>
            crimes. Every page of the sacred writings sets forth this <lb/>
            mercy and severity, so that they are as clear as light to every <lb/>
            well informed mind. It is, therefore, surprising that the <lb/>
            human heart is so prone to evil, and covets present and <lb/>
            fleeting advantages more than future and everlasting re­ <lb/>
            wards, when it is known that all things are open to the view <lb/>
            of the Almighty, and that nothing can escape the penetration <lb/>
            of the divine scrutiny.</p>
          <p>The metropolis of Canterbury having languished in fear <lb/>
            and grief and a state of widowhood, deprived of its bishop, <lb/>
            for three years, the righteous Judge, who beholds from heaven <lb/>
            the children of men and perceives all the world running after <lb/>
            the vanity of vanities, visited with a severe disease the king <lb/>
            of England who was polluted by the guilt of so many crimes. <lb/>
            Thus punished by sickness, he had recourse to the priests of <lb/>

            the wounds of his conscience by humble confession, pro­ <lb/>
            mised amendment of life and commanded the rulers of the <lb/>
            church to choose an archbishop according to the will of <lb/>
            God. It happened that at that time Anselm, abbot of Bee, <lb/>
            had crossed over to England on the affairs of his monastery. <lb/>
            On hearing that the king had given orders for the election of <lb/>
            a metropolitan, holy church was filled with joy and an assem­ <lb/>
            bly of her leading rulers was held to treat of the business on <lb/>
            which they were summoned. At length, taking into consi­ <lb/>
            deration the sanctity and wisdom of the venerable Anselm, <lb/>
            he was unanimously elected in the name of the Lord, and, <lb/>
            very unwillingly on his part, elevated to the metropolitan <lb/>
            see of Canterbury. Having been solemnly enthroned, this <lb/>
            able pastor was often in great tribulation when he carefully <lb/>
            weighed the serious and difficult burthens imposed upon <lb/>
            him. So far from being lifted up by his high promotion, he <lb/>
            was filled with alarm lest many of those placed under his <lb/>
            government, who were erring from the right way, should <lb/>
            come to perdition. He found a variety of things in his <lb/>
            diocese which required correction. It was often his duty to <lb/>
            censure a sinful monarch and a stubborn nobility. This ex­ <lb/>
            posed him to their repeated attacks, and he was twice driven <lb/>
            into exile for his zeal in the cause of justice. Both by <lb/>
            word and good example, he strove to improve the perverse <lb/>
            habits of his flock ; but some of them were so hardened in <lb/>
            iniquity that he could not succeed as he wished. For, as <lb/>
            Solomon says, the perverse are difficult to correct, and the <lb/>
            number of the foolish is infinite.</p>
          <p>In those days the light of true holiness was dim among all <lb/>
            orders in the state, and the princes of the world with their <lb/>
            subjects abandoned themselves to deeds of darkness. Wil­ <lb/>
            liam Rufus, king of England, was a young man of loose and <lb/>
            debauched morals, and his people but too readily followed <lb/>
            his example. He was imperious, daring, and warlike, and <lb/>
            gloried in the pomp of his numerous troops. His great de­ <lb/>
            light consisted in conferring the honours of knighthood on <lb/>
            account of the worldly splendour with which it surrounded <lb/>
            him. He took no care to defend the country folk against <lb/>
            his men-at-arms, so that their property was at the entire <lb/>
            mercy of his young knights and squires. The king's me­ <lb/>
            mory was very tenacious, and his zeal either for good or evil <pb n="471"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1089.] </note> <lb/>
            was ardent. Robbers and thieves felt the terrible weight of <lb/>
            his power, and his efforts to keep the peace throughout his <lb/>
            dominion were unceasing. He so managed his subjects, either <lb/>
            by making them partake of his bounty, or curbing them <lb/>
            by the terror of his arms, that no one dared whisper a word <lb/>
            in opposition to his will.</p>

          <p>WILLIAM RUFUS being now firmly established on the <lb/>
            throne, he assembled his barons at Winchester and opened <lb/>
            his mind to them in the following discourse:—" You are <lb/>
            well aware," he said, " illustrious lords, in what manner my <lb/>
            brother Robert has kept faith with me, and how much trou­ <lb/>
            ble he has occasioned me. It does not require many words <lb/>
            to tell you what numbers of my liegemen he has caused to <lb/>
            rebel against me, and how-he conspired to deprive me of my <lb/>
            crown and my life. It is well known that in the very first <lb/>
            year of my reign he would have involved me in insupport­ <lb/>
            able difficulties, had not divine goodness in its great mercy <lb/>
            averted the evil. And now our holy church addresses to <lb/>
            me her lamentable complaints from parts beyond the sea, <lb/>
            bathed daily in tears of the deepest grief, because being <lb/>
            without a just patron and protector she finds herself among <lb/>
            her malignant enemies like a sheep in the midst of wolves. <lb/>
            He who takes no care to defend his own dominions from <lb/>
            rapacious attacks, makes it his object to usurp mine by fraud <lb/>
            or force. It is for this reason that I warn you who were my <lb/>
            father's liegemen, and who held fiefs of him both in Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy and England, to support me loyally, manfully, and <lb/>
            with unanimity, in my just enterprises. We ought not to <lb/>
            suffer dens of robbers to exist in Normandy, and harass the <lb/>
            faithful and ruin the abbeys which our fathers founded with <lb/>
            so much zeaL The whole country is a prey to robbery and <lb/>
            murder, and is often forcibly reminded of the great duke <lb/>
            William who delivered it from war both foreign and internal. <lb/>
            It becomes me who inherit both his name and his crown, <lb/>
            to pursue zealously the same course that he did for the <lb/>
            defence of his country. Meet therefore, I pray you, in <pb n="472"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. CH.IX. </note> <lb/>
            council, and consult with prudence, and then give me your <lb/>
            advice what ought to be done in this state of affairs. If you <lb/>
            approve of it, I will send over an army to Normandy and <lb/>
            make reprisals for the mischief which my brother without <lb/>
            any provocation has contrived against me. I will succour <lb/>
            the church of God, protect widows and orphans, and punish <lb/>
            robbers and assassins with the sword of justice."</p>
          <p>All the assembly concurred in these proposals, and lauded <lb/>
            the king's intrepid spirit. At that time King William made <lb/>
            William de Warrenne earl of Surrey but not long after­ <lb/>
            wards he was snatched away by death which spares no one.2 <lb/>
            The Cluniac monks whom he had established at Lewes,3 in­ <lb/>
            terred his body in their chapter, and recorded his character <lb/>

            In rearing this his noblest monument. <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author states here, correctly, that William de Warrenne was made <lb/>

            He had, also, it has been supposed, a brother also named Ralph, men­ <lb/>
            tioned in the Chartulary of the Trinité-du-Mont, who came over to <lb/>
            England, according to Domesday-book, and was engaged in the rebellion <lb/>
            of Ralph de Gauder, if the passage referred to does not apply to the latter <lb/>
            from a confusion of the names. This illustrious family was originally of <lb/>

            drede, his wife, about the year 1078, in the meadows below the castle, <lb/>
            which was the earl's principal seat. The church, on the site of which a <lb/>
            small chapel stood before the conquest, was dedicated to St. Pancras. <lb/>
            Both the earl and countess were interred there. Gundrede's grave-stone, a <lb/>
            slab of black marble, the greater part of the inscription on which is legible, <lb/>
            was carried off from the ruins after the Reformation, but recovered some <lb/>
            years since, and deposited in the church at Southover adjoining the town <lb/>
            of Lewes. Recently, in cutting a line of railway through the ruins of the <lb/>
            priory, the coffins containing the remains both of William de Warrenne <lb/>

          <p>The earl was succeeded by his two sons, William and Rey­ <lb/>

            long period under William and Henry, kings of England, <lb/>
            being distinguished for their valour, worth, and power.</p>
          <p>King William likewise conferred great honours and pos­ <lb/>
            sessions on Robert Fitz-Hamon,3 so that he ranked among <lb/>
            the greatest of the English nobles. He married Sibylle, <lb/>
            daughter of Earl Roger, who bore him a daughter, called <lb/>
            Matilda, afterwards married to Robert, son of King Henry. <lb/>

            and coming to Rome, at the age of fifteen embraced Christianity, and was <lb/>
            baptized by St. Cornelius. The emperor Diocletian endeavoured to win <lb/>
            him back to his ancient faith, but, preferring martyrdom, he was beheaded <lb/>
            on the Aurelian Way. His feast was kept on the 4th of the ides (12th) <lb/>

            died in child-birth, at Castle Acre in Norfolk, the 27th of May, 1085. <lb/>
            The Conqueror's chatter of foundation of the priory of Lewes discloses the <lb/>
            curious fact, which no historian of the time has mentioned, that Gundrede <lb/>
            was a daughter of Queen Matilda. Her epitaph at Lewes calls her stirps <lb/>
            ducum, and in the charter of donation of the priory of Walton in Norfolk <lb/>
            to St. Pancras at Lewes by William the Conqueror, the copy of which is <lb/>
            not however very exact, that prince calls her his daughter. But it has <lb/>
            been well conjectured that she was, in fact, as well as her brother Gerbode, <lb/>
            the issue of Matilda by a former marriage. She must, therefore, have <lb/>
            been divorced when she married William, and that might have been the <lb/>
            'reason for Pope Leo's offering so strenuous an opposition to that marriage. </note><note type="footnote"> Gerbode, who had the earldom of Chester conferred upon him by the <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WHEN the people of Maine learned that the Normans were <lb/>
            at variance, they thought it a convenient opportunity for <lb/>
            Growing off their insolent yoke, an attempt they had often <lb/>
            nade in the time of William the Great, king of England. <lb/>
            Duke Robert discovering this, sent ambassadors with pre­ <lb/>
            sents to Fulk, count of Anjou,1 earnestly entreating him to <lb/>
            leter the Manceaux from their bold enterprise, and to join <lb/>
            him in Normandy, where he was suffering from severe ill­ <lb/>
            less. Fulk readily accepted the invitation, and found the <lb/>
            luke already convalescent. They had many friendly con­ <lb/>
            erences, in the course of which the count said to the duke• <lb/>
            ' There is one thing which I have much at heart, and if you <lb/>
            vill bring it to pass I will undertake to reduce the Manceaux <lb/>
            ;o submission, and will become from henceforth your faithful <lb/>
            ally. I have formed an attachment for Bertrade, daughter of <lb/>
            Simon de Montfort, and niece to William, count of Eyreux, <lb/>
            who is brought up by her guardian, the countess Heloise. 2 I <lb/>
            pray you to accomplish my marriage with her, and I will per­ <lb/>
            form all I have promised you." The duke immediately sent <lb/>
            for the count of Evreux to speak with him on the subject. <lb/>
            The count then consulted with his most intimate friends and <lb/>
            anxiously inquired what course he ought to take. At last, <lb/>
            having fully weighed the proposal, he returned to the duke's <lb/>
            court, and, among other conversation, addressed him thus : <lb/>
            " My lord duke, you ask what is very contrary to my wishes <lb/>
            when you demand that I should give my niece, who is now a <lb/>
            mere girl, and whose guardianship was entrusted to me by <lb/>
            mv brother-in-law, in marriage to a man who has been <lb/>

            county of Maine into your power, but you deprive me of my <lb/>
            own inheritance. Is what you propose reasonable ? I shall <lb/>
            not comply with your wishes, unless you restore me Bavent, <lb/>
            Noyon,1Gracé, Gravençon and Ecouché,2 with the other fiefs <lb/>
            of my uncle Ralph, who, on account of the extraordinary size <lb/>
            of his head and his shaggy hair was humorously surnamed <lb/>
            Tête d'Ane (Ass's-head).3 I also require that my nephew, <lb/>
            William de Breteuil, shall be re-instated in Pont-St.-Pierre, <lb/>
            and other estates which we can prove to be legally and <lb/>
            reasonably ours by right of inheritance. I have lawful and <lb/>
            credible witnesses that Robert de Gacé, the son of my uncle <lb/>
            Ralph, whom I named before, left me heir of all his domains. <lb/>
            But King William, who was our cousin, being more powerful <lb/>
            than we were, appropriated to himself all the portions of our <lb/>
            inheritance, as a lion would in sharing a stag. When, my <lb/>
            lord duke, you have well considered all this, do what is right <lb/>
            towards us, and we will obey your commands."</p>
          <p>The duke, having heard this reply, determined, on con­ <lb/>
            sultation with his council, to concede the lesser objects, that <lb/>
            he might not lose what was more important. At that time, <lb/>
            Edgar Atheling,4 Robert de Belèsme, and William d'Arques, <lb/>
            a monk of Molême,5 were his principal councillors. The <lb/>
            duke therefore granted the demands of William d'Evreux, <lb/>
            and his nephew William de Breteuil, and ceded to them the <lb/>
            places before named, with the lands, appertaining to them, <lb/>
            except Ecouché, which was held by Gerard de Gournai, who <lb/>
            was of the same family, being the son of Basile, daughter of <note type="footnote"> 1 Bavent, near Troarn, and Noyon-sur-Audelle, now Charleval. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gravençon, near Lillebonne, and Ecouche, near Argenton. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Ralph Tête-d'An, second son of Archbishop Robert, count d'Evreux. <lb/>

            Gerard Finite!, and so powerful, that no one dared to offer <lb/>
            him violence. Upon this, the count of Anjou, to his great joy, <lb/>
            secured the prize he so much desired-marrying a third wife <lb/>
            while he had two already living. Bertrade bore him a son <lb/>
            who was named Fulk. Faithful to his engagements, Fulk <lb/>
            then went among the people of Maine, and endeavouring to <lb/>
            keep them quiet, more by entreaties and promises, than by <lb/>
            force of arms, succeeded at last in deferring the threatened <lb/>
            revolt for a year. This count was very blameable, and even <lb/>
            infamous in many parts of his conduct, and abandoned him­ <lb/>
            self to all sorts of vices. His feet being deformed, he had <lb/>
            shoes made of an unusual length, and very sharp at the toes, <lb/>
            so that they might conceal the excrescences, commonly <lb/>
            called bunnions, which caused his feet to be so ill-shaped. <lb/>
            This new fashion became common throughout the west, and <lb/>
            wonderfully pleased light-minded persons, and the lovers of <lb/>
            novelty. In consequence, the shoemakers, in making shoes, <lb/>
            shape them like scorpions' tails, vulgarly called pigaces,' a <lb/>
            fashion which almost all the world, both rich and poor, are <lb/>
            wonderfully taken with, while in former times, shoes with <lb/>
            round toes, fitted to the form, were in common use both <lb/>
            by rich and poor, clergy and laity. But now men of the <lb/>
            world sought in their pride fashions of dress which accorded <lb/>
            with their perverse habits; and what formerly honourable <lb/>
            persons thought a mark of disgrace, and rejected as in­ <lb/>
            famous, the men of this age find to be sweet as honey to <lb/>
            their taste, and parade on their persons as a special dis­ <lb/>
            tinction.</p>
          <p>A debauched fellow named Robert, was the first about.the <lb/>
            court of William Rufus who introduced the practice of <lb/>
            filling the long points of the shoes with tow, and of turning <lb/>
            them up like a ram's horn. Hence he got the surname of <lb/>
            Cornard ; and this absurd fashion was speedily adopted by <lb/>
            great numbers of the nobility as a proud distinction, and sign <note type="footnote"> 1 Pigaceas; Ordericus appears to have Latinized a Norman-French <lb/>

            nothing escaped his observation, recluse as he was. That of the long- <lb/>

            of merit. At this time effeminacy was the prevailing vice <lb/>
            throughout the world. Men revelled in vice without re­ <lb/>
            morse, and odious wretches, who ought to have been food for <lb/>
            the flames, shamefully abandoned themselves to the foulest <lb/>
            Sodomitical practices. The habits of illustrious men were <lb/>
            disregarded ; the admonitions of priests derided ; and the cus­ <lb/>
            toms of barbarians adopted in dress and in the mode of life. <lb/>
            They parted their hair from the crown of the head on each side <lb/>
            of the forehead, and let their locks grow long like women, and <lb/>
            wore long shirts, and tunics, closely tied with points. They <lb/>
            wasted their time, spending it according to their own fancy, <lb/>
            and without regard to the law of God, or the customs of their <lb/>
            fathers. The night was devoted to banqueting and drunk. <lb/>
            enness, to silly talk, dice, tables, and other games. Thus, after <lb/>
            the death of Pope Gregory, and William the Bastard, and <lb/>
            other religious princes, the simple habits of our fathers <lb/>
            were abandoned in almost all the west of Europe. They <lb/>
            used a modest dress, well fitted to the proportions of their <lb/>
            bodies, which was convenient for riding and walking, and <lb/>
            for all active employments as common sense dictated. <lb/>
            But in our days, ancient customs are almost all changed for <lb/>
            new fashions. Our wanton youths are sunk in effeminacy, <lb/>
            and the courtiers study to make themselves agreeable to the <lb/>
            women by every sort of lasciviousness. They insert their <lb/>
            toes, the extremities of theii bodies, in things like serpents' <lb/>
            tails, which present to view the shape of scorpions. Sweep­ <lb/>
            in,, the dusty ground with the prodigious trains of their <lb/>
            robes and mantles; they cover their hands with gloves too <lb/>
            long and wide for doing anything useful, and, encumbered <lb/>
            with these superfluities, lose the free use of their limbs for <lb/>
            active employment. The fore-part of their heads is bare <lb/>
            after the manner of thieves, while on the back, they nourish <lb/>
            long hair like harlots. In former times, penitents, captives, <lb/>
            and pilgrims usually went unshaved, and wore long beards, <lb/>
            as an outward mark of their penance, or captivity, or pil­ <lb/>
            grimage. Now, almost all the world wear crisped hair and <lb/>
            beards, carrying on their faces the tokens of their filthy lust, <lb/>
            like stinking goats. Their locks are curled with hot irons, <lb/>
            and, instead of wearing caps, they bind their heads with <lb/>
            fillets. A knight seldom appears in public with his head <lb/>
            uncovered, and properly shaved according to the apostolic <pb n="479"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1090.] </note> <lb/>
            precept.1 Their exterior appearance and dress thus exhibit <lb/>
            what are their inward thoughts, and how little reverence <lb/>
            they have for God.</p>
          <p>In consequence, the Almighty Judge who sits on his throne <lb/>
            in the heavens, perceiving the heart of man a prey to <lb/>
            iniquity, visits the people lost in ignorance, and the unbridled <lb/>
            populace, with a variety of inflictions. He permits men to <lb/>
            be worn down with sickness and disquieted by wars; and <lb/>
            gives up to hypocritical rulers those whom he finds to be <lb/>
            opposed to his will, and the ready transgressors of his law. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, the elect, inflamed with the zeal of Phineas, are <lb/>
            often incensed at these evil ways, and cry to the Lord with <lb/>
            the prophet, " I beheld the transgressors and was grieved, <lb/>
            because they kept not thy word."2 In consequence, holy doc­ <lb/>
            tors rebuke, entreat, and threaten them, with patience and <lb/>
            wisdom. But their efforts are set at nought by the hardness <lb/>
            of their depraved hearts, which foster and harbour all the <lb/>
            pollutions of sin. If Persius and Plautus, and other bitter <lb/>
            satirists were now living, and keenly observed the manner in <lb/>
            which people in our times give the run to their passions, in <lb/>
            public and private, they would easily find abundant opportu­ <lb/>
            nities for exercising their talents in sarcasm and ridicule.</p>

            which is yours by right of inheritance." The people of <lb/>
            Maine sent this message to the Ligurian chiefs, not for the <lb/>
            love they bore them but to find some reasonable excuse for <lb/>
            shaking off the Norman yoke, which for nearly thirty years2 <lb/>
            had sharply galled their stubborn necks.</p>
          <p>The two sons of Azo, who received this proposal in Liguria, <lb/>
            were greatly delighted with it, and took counsel with their <lb/>
            intimate friends what was to be done. It was at length de­ <lb/>
            termined that Fulk, the eldest, should retain their father's <lb/>
            fiefs in Italy, while his brother, Hugh, should assert his pre­ <lb/>
            tensions to the state of Maine, in right of his mother. In <lb/>
            short, Geoffrey of Mayenne, Elias,3 and other citizens and <lb/>
            lords of castles, received Hugh on his arrival, and for some <lb/>
            time lent him aid in recovering his mother's inheritance.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, the venerable Hoel, who had been made <lb/>
            bishop by the choice of King William,4 always remained faith­ <lb/>
            fill to him and his sons. As far as was in his power, he now <lb/>
            opposed a revolt which must be attended with bloodshed, <lb/>
            launching an interdict against those who were most obsti­ <lb/>
            nate, and excommunicating them by his episcopal authority, <lb/>
            he cut them off from the communion of holy mother church. <lb/>
            This roused against him the anger of the promoters of the <lb/>
            rebellion, who threatened to wreak their vengeance upon <note type="footnote"> I See vol. i. p. 448. </note><note type="footnote"> a Twenty-eight years, their submission having been yielded in the year <lb/>

            attended by his clerks, and duly performing his episcopal <lb/>
            functions, Elias de la Flèche seized him, and throwing him <lb/>
            into prison, detained him there till such time as Hugh should <lb/>
            have obtained possession of the city of Mans. Meanwhile, <lb/>
            the church shared her bishop's sorrows ; the holy images of <lb/>
            the Lord, with the crucifixes, and the shrines containing the <lb/>
            relics of saints were laid prostrate on the floor, the church- <lb/>
            doors were hedged with thorns, the bells ceased to ring, the <lb/>
            chants were hushed, all the usual solemn offices were sus­ <lb/>
            pended, and thus the widowed church abandoned herself to <lb/>
            grief.</p>
          <p>The people of Maine, finding their new count destitute of <lb/>
            sense as well as of wealth and courage, began to repent <lb/>
            of their imprudent act, and despised and detested him, as <lb/>
            the Shechemites did Abimelech.1 He was, indeed, an im­ <lb/>
            becile, a coward, and an idler, and totally unfit to hold the <lb/>
            reins of government in so high a station. He had married <lb/>
            the daughter of Robert Guiscard,2 but such a poltroon could <lb/>
            not brook the spirit of a high-minded woman, and he there­ <lb/>
            fore repudiated her ; for which he was excommunicated by <lb/>
            Pope Urban. The Allobroges3 detested him and were glad <lb/>
            of an opportunity of turning him over to the fierce Cisalpines. <lb/>
            Ignorant among the well informed, a coward among gallant <lb/>
            knights, he was considered a craven count; for such were his <lb/>
            alarms, that he frequently fainted, and only thought of flight <lb/>
            as his best remedy. The people of Maine discovering this, <lb/>
            were filled with joy and endeavoured, through the elders4 of <lb/>
            the land, to increase his terrors.</p>
          <p>At last Elias, his cousin, came to him, and conversing on <lb/>
            the pressure of circumstances, said: " My lord, I hear it <lb/>

            dependent race and fierce habits. In truth, your friends <lb/>
            should not dissuade you from this purpose. For while your <lb/>
            disposition is gentle, and you are a lover of peace and tran­ <lb/>
            quillity, the people of this country are always ready for war <lb/>
            and impatient of repose. Moreover, ,the implacable Normans <lb/>
            lay claim to Maine and most ferociously threaten to inflict <lb/>
            the greatest severities on its inhabitants. The sons of King <lb/>
            William, who were at variance, have been reconciled, and are <lb/>
            now assembling a vast army in Normandy, with which they <lb/>
            intend to make a sudden irruption into our territories, and <lb/>
            to attack and pursue without mercy us who have revolted <lb/>
            against them. You may fully believe that it is for this pur­ <lb/>
            pose King William has crossed over to Normandy with so <lb/>
            much pomp, and I have no doubt his arrival will cause us <lb/>
            great alarm and find us much to do." On hearing this, <lb/>
            Hugh plainly told Elias that it was his wish to sell his rights <lb/>
            in the county of Maine and return to his own country. Elias <lb/>
            replied: " My lord, I am your cousin, and it was by my <lb/>
            support you were made count, an honour which you can give <lb/>
            or sell to no one but myself. For the daughter of count <lb/>
            Herbert married Lancelin de Beaugenci, and bore him <lb/>
            Lancelin, father of Ralph,' and John, who was my father. I <lb/>
            have thus plainly shown that I, as well as you, am descended <lb/>
            from count Herbert. Now, then, receive from me what <lb/>
            shall be agreed on between us, and resign in my favour the <lb/>
            dignity of count, as in truth it ought to be mine from near­ <lb/>
            ness of kin. The object of my ambition is attended with <lb/>
            serious difficulties, and I shall scarcely ever possess it in <lb/>
            peace so long as either of the three sons of King William <lb/>
            are alive. It appears to be disgraceful to such powerful <lb/>
            princes, who can surround us with a hundred thousand <lb/>
            troops, that they should patiently suffer an affront from a <lb/>
            kindred race who live on their frontier, or lose in any man­ <lb/>
            ner without a fearful struggle any rights which their father <lb/>
            gained by some sort of treaty. Nevertheless, I am inspired <lb/>
            by this love of independence, and rightfully contending for <lb/>
            mv grandmother's heritage, I shall be animated by trust in <lb/>
            God." <note type="footnote"> 1 Ralph, lord of Beaugenci, was son-in-law of Hugh, count de Verman­ <lb/>

            of Maine, which he held bravely twenty years.1 He suc­ <lb/>

            her a daughter, named Eremburge, who was married to the <lb/>
            son of Fulk, count of Anjou, his suzerain. On attaining <lb/>
            power, he greatly mended his conduct and became eminent <lb/>
            for his virtues, worthily honouring the clergy and church of <lb/>
            God, and attending daily at mass and divine service. He <lb/>
            governed his people with equity, and, as far as was in his <lb/>

            lasted a long time, so that the neighbourhood was exposed <lb/>
            to rapine and fire, with loss of life. Amauri de Montfort, <lb/>
            who had his surname of Le Fort, on account of his valour, <lb/>
            became formidable by his daring and cruel acts to all his <lb/>

            lands of William de Breteuil, like a raging lion, and en­ <lb/>
            gaging, singly, in combat with two men-at-arms, he was <lb/>
            pierced in the side by the lance of one of them, so that he <lb/>
            died the same day. On his decease, his brother Richard <lb/>
            succeeded to the domains of his father, and zealously devoted <lb/>
            himself to take vengeance on William de Breteuil for his <lb/>

          <p>Duke Robert frequently employed in his wars Gilbert, <lb/>
            son of Ingenulf de Laigle,1 on account of his great bravery, <lb/>
            and gave him the castle of Exmes as his recompense, and <lb/>
            for the defence of the country. This gave great offence to <lb/>
            Robert de Belèsme, whose rage and jealousy were so roused, <lb/>
            that he assembled troops, and in the first week of January <lb/>
            beset the castle for four days, assaulting it with great <lb/>
            vigour, notwithstanding the winter's frost and snow. Gil­ <lb/>
            bert had but a small number of followers within the fortress, <lb/>
            but they were brave, and made a stout resistance. Hurling <lb/>
            spears and stones on the assailants, they precipitated them <lb/>
            into the ditch, wounding some and killing others; mean­ <lb/>
            while, the young Gilbert, lord of Laigle, came to his aid with <lb/>
            eighty soldiers, and, getting into the castle by night, this <lb/>
            addition to the garrison with provisions and arms enabled <lb/>
            his uncle to maintain the defence. Upon this, the tyrant <lb/>
            Belèsme, finding how strongly the place was fortified, and <lb/>
            the stout resistance made by its defenders, did not venture <lb/>
            to prolong the siege, and drew off his troops with rage and <lb/>
            mortification, having gained nothing but his followers' <lb/>
            wounds. The year following, as Gilbert, the knight just <lb/>

            promises made him by King William, went to the duke at <lb/>
            Rouen, and insolently demanded the restoration of the <lb/>
            castle of Ivri. The duke replied, " 1 gave Brionne, a noble <lb/>
            castle, to your father in exchange for that of Ivri." But the <lb/>
            earl of Mellent said, " I do not agree to that exchange, and <lb/>
            I choose to have what your father gave to mine, 1 otherwise, <lb/>
            by St. Nicaise ,2 I shall do what will be very disagreeable to <lb/>
            you." The duke was greatly incensed, and caused Robert <lb/>
            to be arrested, and thrown into prison in the castle of Bri­ <lb/>
            onne, under the custody of Robert, son of Baldwin.3 The <lb/>
            crafty old Roger de Beaumont, hearing that his son was a <lb/>
            prisoner, applied himself for some days to other affairs, just <lb/>
            as if he had received no intelligence of his son's misfortune, <lb/>
            hiding his grief under a smiling face. At last, when he <lb/>
            thought the duke's wrath was somewhat abated, he sent him <lb/>
            presents, and then went to his court. Having offered his <lb/>
            respects to the duke, and being saluted in return, he thus <lb/>
            addressed him: " My lord duke, I return your highness <lb/>
            thanks for having chastised the arrogance of my son with <lb/>
            princely severity. Had I sufficient spirit at my advanced <lb/>
            age, I should have long ago done it myself, for his insolence <lb/>
            and disregard of my admonitions have often pained me. It <lb/>
            is therefore high time that he should be rebuked, and taught <lb/>
            to know how to conduct himself when addressing his supe­ <lb/>
            riors and seniors."</p>
          <p>With language of this sort, Roger contrived to conciliate <lb/>
            the duke, who, not knowing what was to follow, eagerly <lb/>
            swallowed the flattery. Roger was now familiarly admitted <lb/>
            to the duke's councils, and it afterwards appeared that these <lb/>
            steps were all leading to his son's liberation. He was one <lb/>

            besides valiant and noble sons, one being count of Mellent, <lb/>
            in France, and the other earl of Warwick in England. <lb/>
            Thus strong in good sense, wealth, and supporters, he one <lb/>
            day came to the duke, and said, " You ought to deal <lb/>
            graciously with me, my lord duke, recollecting that I have <lb/>
            always been loyal to the princes of Normandy. I never <lb/>
            broke my fealty to my liege lord, but on the contrary, have <lb/>
            done and suffered much in his cause. You have been your­ <lb/>
            self witness of this in the battle when I fought against the <lb/>
            rebels under your father's eyes,2 where Roger of Spain, with <lb/>
            his sons Albert and Elinance fell, besides many others. I <lb/>
            learnt from childhood the duty of firm perseverance in loy­ <lb/>
            alty. I received it as the heritage of my father, Thorold, <lb/>
            and my grandfather Umfrid, and I have zealously performed <lb/>
            it all my life, both in prosperity and adversity. Far be it <lb/>
            from me in my old age to commit a breach of faith, which I <lb/>
            have always detested, and from my youth upwards used <lb/>
            every effort to avoid. Your father, therefore finding me ever <lb/>
            at his side, and firmly maintaining my allegiance, as well <lb/>
            as manfully sustaining the evils to which my fealty to him <lb/>
            exposed me, always admitted me to his most secret coun­ <lb/>
            cils in preference to his other nobles." The duke replied <lb/>
            as follows, " I know well, Sir Roger, from many witnesses, <lb/>
            your great fidelity to my predecessors, and therefore, as they <lb/>
            highly esteemed you, and adopted your judicious advice, I <lb/>
            also, taking advantage of your wisdom, embrace your sugges­ <lb/>
            tions. If I have imprisoned your son, I did it from no ill-will <lb/>
            to you, but in consequence of his own folly and insolence, in <lb/>
            importuning and threatening me." Roger then said, " I <lb/>
            thank your highness from the bottom of my heart, for the <lb/>
            chastisement you inflicted on the rash youth. But now if <lb/>
            it please your highness, I pray you to pardon him. Release <note type="footnote"> 1 Waleran II., de Meulan, 1015?—October 8, 1069 or 1070. Hugh <lb/>

            set at liberty the count of Mellent, and permitted him to <lb/>
            depart with his father.</p>
          <p>Not long afterwards Roger and his son begged the duke <lb/>
            to restore Brionne to them, accompanying the request with <lb/>
            an offer of a large sum; whereupon the duke, who was in <lb/>
            want of money, lent a ready ear to their proposals, and <lb/>
            ordered Robert, who had the custody of the castle, to give <lb/>
            it up to Roger. His answer to the duke was this: " If it <lb/>
            be your desire to have Brionne in your own hands, as your <lb/>
            father held it, I will make no difficulty in delivering it to <lb/>
            you ; but otherwise I will keep what is my own inheritance, <lb/>
            and yield it to no man while I live. It is well known to all <lb/>
            the inhabitants of this province that Richard the elder, duko <lb/>
            of Normandy, granted Brionne with the county belonging <lb/>
            to it, in full right to his son Godfrey, and that on his death <lb/>
            he left it to his son Gilbert. When Count Gilbert was <lb/>
            cruelly murdered by infamous assassins, his sons, under the <lb/>
            care of their guardians, fled for safety from his enemies to <lb/>
            the court of Baldwin, count of Flanders, whereupon your <lb/>
            father attached part of the domains to the fief of my grand­ <lb/>
            father, distributing the rest among strangers. A long time <lb/>
            afterwards, having married the daughter of this Baldwin of <lb/>
            Flanders, the duke, at his request, restored to my father <lb/>
            Baldwin, Meules and Le Sap, 1 and gave him his aunt's <lb/>
            daughter in marriage. At the same time, he restored <lb/>
            Bienfaite and Orbec to his brother Richard. At length, by <lb/>
            your favour, my lord, whom it is my desire to obey in all <lb/>
            things, I am now in possession of Brionne, the principal <lb/>
            seat of my grandfather, and, God supporting my right, I <lb/>
            will keep it to the end."</p>
          <p>When Roger heard this, he earnestly encouraged the <lb/>
            duke not to give way, but instantly collecting a body of <lb/>
            troops to crush his refractory vassal, and laying siege to the <lb/>
            strong fortress, which lay in the very heart of his dominions, <lb/>
            compel its surrender. Accordingly in Whitsun-week Duke <lb/>
            Robert sat down before Brionne, where. Robert, son of <note type="footnote"> 1 Baldwin, like his father, bore a variety of names; we find him <lb/>
            successively called Baldwin Fitz-Gilbert, Baldwin de Meules, Baldwin du <lb/>
            Sap, Baldwin the Viscount, and Baldwin of Exeter. </note> <pb n="491"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 1090.] </note> <lb/>
            Baldwin, had only six knights1 to defend it against an army. <lb/>
            The lord of Beaumont and the count of Mellent had col­ <lb/>
            lected large bodies of soldiers and closely invested the <lb/>
            fortress on all sides to prevent any succour or supplies of <lb/>
            victuals being thrown in; and, pressing their advantage, <lb/>
            after the ninth day made a vigorous assault. It being the <lb/>
            commencement of summer, the weather was very warm, and <lb/>
            there was a great drought, of which the besiegers took <lb/>
            advantage; for they adroitly heated the iron points of their <lb/>
            missile weapons in a furnace which was built for the oc­ <lb/>
            casion, and all of a sudden hurled them on the roof of the <lb/>
            great hall of the castle, where the red-hot steel of the arrows <lb/>
            and javelins, driven with great force into the shingles,2 set fire <lb/>
            to the dry moss which in course of time had overspread the <lb/>
            roof, so that the whole was quickly in a blaze. Meanwhile <lb/>
            the garrison were fighting stoutly on the fortifications, and <lb/>
            not expecting any such manoeuvre, were in great spirits <lb/>
            until they found the flames rising over their heads. When <lb/>
            however they discovered that the whole building above them <lb/>
            was falling to ruins, the flames within spreading through <lb/>
            every part, they surrendered at discretion. Thus Duke <lb/>
            Robert, by an assault which only lasted from nine o'clock <lb/>
            till sunset, gained possession of Brionne, which it took his <lb/>
            father, William, with the aid of Henry, king of France, <lb/>
            three years to reduce, when Guv, son of Reynold of Bur­ <lb/>
            gundy, shut himself up in it after the battle of Val-des- <lb/>
            Dunes. <note type="footnote"> 1 ,Militibus. The chroniclers using this word for knights as well as <lb/>
            common soldiers, there is often difficulty in giving the right version, unless <lb/>
            the context is clear. In the present case, six soldiers would, indeed, be a <lb/>
            small garrison for such a fortress as Brionne, but that number of knights, <lb/>
            with their retainers, might possibly have made a stout resistance against a <lb/>
            considerable force. M. Le Prevost suggests, however, that the reading <lb/>
            may have been, not sex, but sexaginta, sixty. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It appears that the roof of the castle was covered with shingles of <lb/>
            wood, instead of slates or tiles. This is still the case with respect to many <lb/>

            he was strongly supported by his friends and kinsmen, and <lb/>
            had many partisans in the duke's court. It has been <lb/>

            vanced them in the world, both on account of their nearness <lb/>

            'fiefs, manors, and lordships, both in England and Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy. Both the brothers also made excellent marriages <lb/>
            with wives of noble families. Richard married Rohais, <lb/>
            daughter of "Walter Giffard,1 who bore him several sons as <lb/>

            those about her. She rode in knightly armour when the <lb/>
            vassals took the field, and exhibited as much daring among <lb/>
            belted knights and men-at-arms as Camilla, the renowned <lb/>
            virgin of Italy among the squadrons of Turnus. Nor was <lb/>
            she inferior to Lampedona and Marseppa, Hyppolyta, and <lb/>
            Penthesilia, and the other warrior-queens of the Amazons, <lb/>
            spoken of by Pompeius Trogus4 and Virgil, and other writers <lb/>
            of history, with whom the kings of Asia formed connexions, <lb/>
            and who, for fifteen years, ruled the Asiatic nations. The <lb/>
            people of Evreux had many allies, so that they harassed <lb/>
            those of Conches by continually burning their property, <lb/>
            and carried off much booty. But there was no great dis­ <lb/>
            parity, and the others, in turn, took their revenge. Mean­ <lb/>

            which he had a right to expect from his liege lord; but his <lb/>
            complaints were fruitless and he obtained no redress. Upon <lb/>
            this he turned his attention to another quarter, being com­ <lb/>
            pelled to seek a protector where he could. He therefore <lb/>
            made application by his envoys to the king of England, and <lb/>
            laying his distressed circumstances before him, promised <lb/>
            him the fealty of all his estates if he would afford him suc­ <lb/>
            cour. The king was highly pleased at the proposal, and <lb/>
            promised efficacious aid to the suppliant who so much <lb/>
            needed it. In consequence he gave orders to Count Ste­ <lb/>
            phen1 and Gerard de Gournai, with the other officers who <lb/>
            were in command of his retainers in Normandy, that they <lb/>
            should render every assistance to .Ralph, and throw supplies <lb/>
            of all kinds into his castles. Accordingly they obeyed with <lb/>
            alacrity the royal commands and. gave their support to <lb/>
            Ralph, striving earnestly to do the king's pleasure.</p>
          <p>In the month of November Count William assembled a <lb/>
            large body of troops and laid siege to Conches. His two i <lb/>
            nephews, William de Breteuil and Richard de Moutfort,) <lb/>
            with their vassals, joined him in the attack upon the people <lb/>
            of Conches. Then Richard de Montfort, while taking pos­ <lb/>
            session of the abbey of St. Peter de Châtillon,2 regardless of <lb/>
            the respect due to the monks, who cried to the Lord with <lb/>
            bitter lamentations, died the same day to the great grief of <lb/>
            both parties; for he was Isabel's twin-brother as well as <lb/>
            nephew of Count William by his sister. Both parties there­ <lb/>
            fore deplored the death of the brave marcher, who perished <lb/>
            while persisting in an evil deed, urged on by his pride and <lb/>
            rashness. His followers bore their lord's body to his native <lb/>
            place, and he was buried in the churchyard of St. Thomas <lb/>
            the Apostle, at Epernon.3 There the monks of Marmoutier <lb/>
            regularly serve God,4 and there also the old Simon, son of <lb/>
            Amauri, and his sons, are buried.</p>
          <p>Not long afterwards the people of Evreux assembled <lb/>

            ches to avenge their discomfiture. At this time Ralph <lb/>
            had in the castle a very strong body of his own and the <lb/>
            king's adherents ; but when the young knights were eager <lb/>
            to sally forth, he said to them : " Arm yourselves and stand <lb/>
            ready, but do not leave the fortress until I give the order. <lb/>
            Permit the enemy to encumber himself with booty, and we <lb/>
            will fall upon him as he is retiring." The youthful soldiers <lb/>
            were ready to obey the commands of so brave and ex­ <lb/>
            perienced a commander, and pursuing the people of Evreux <lb/>
            when they were loaded with booty, charged them with great <lb/>
            fury, and putting them to flight, recovered the spoil. William <lb/>
            de Breteuil and many others were taken prisoners ; and, in <lb/>
            consequence, peace was proposed. The count of Evreux <lb/>
            and his party were ashamed that, having commenced hostili­ <lb/>
            ties through their arrogance, they had suffered the greatest <lb/>
            losses, and therefore after the war had been carried on three <lb/>
            years, they consented to an accommodation, and a meeting <lb/>
            being held, the following terms were agreed on: William1 <lb/>
            paid his uncle three thousand livres for his ransom, and <lb/>
            made his cousin Roger, Ralph's son, heir to the whole of his <lb/>
            fief. The count of Evreux appointed the same Roger,2 who <lb/>
            was his own nephew, his successor in the county. But <lb/>
            Divine Providence, which is not ruled by the will of man, <lb/>
            provided otherwise. The young Roger was of an excellent <lb/>
            disposition and much beloved by his companions and the <lb/>
            vassals and neighbours. He had a great regard for the <lb/>
            clergy and monks, paying them due reverence. Rejecting <lb/>
            the pomp of dress, in which the nobility too much gloried, <lb/>
            his whole demeanour was simple and modest. Upon one <lb/>
            occasion, when the knights were amusing themselves in the <lb/>
            hall at Conches3 with various games, and talking on different <lb/>
            subjects, as the custom is, the Lady Elizabeth4 being present, <lb/>
            one of them said: "I had a dream lately, which much <lb/>
            alarmed me: I saw the Lord on the cross, his whole body <lb/>
            livid and writhing with torture, while I fixed my eyes upon <lb/>
            him in great terror." At this account his companions <lb/>
            remarked: " This dream of yours was solemn and fearful, <note type="footnote"> 1 William de Breteuil. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Roger de Toëni, second son of Ralph de Conches. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Some ruins of the castle, of which this hull was part, are still standing. </note><note type="footnote"> * Elizabeth, his mother, lady of Conches, before called Isabel. </note> <pb n="497"/>

            and seems to forebode some terrible judgment of God upon <lb/>
            you." Baldwin, son of Eustace, count of Boulogne, then <lb/>
            said : " I too, lately saw in a dream the Lord Jesus hanging <lb/>
            on the cross ; but in my vision he was bright and glorious, <lb/>
            and smiled benignantly upon me, graciously making the sign <lb/>
            of the cross on my head." Upon this the by-standers <lb/>
            observed; " This vision seems to promise you some singular <lb/>
            grace and favour."</p>
          <p>The young Roger having heard what passed said to his <lb/>
            mother, " I know a person, not far off, who lately had a <lb/>
            vision of the same kind." His mother's curiosity was ex­ <lb/>
            cited, and she pressed him to tell who it was, and what was <lb/>
            seen ; but the youth blushed, and was unwilling to make it <lb/>
            public. At length, however, he yielded to her repeated <lb/>
            entreaties, in which his friends present joined, and thus <lb/>
            replied : " A certain person lately saw in a vision the Lord <lb/>
            Jesus laying his hand on his head, who graciously blessed <lb/>
            him, calling him in these words : ‘Come quickly to me, <lb/>
            beloved, and I will give thee the joys of life.' I therefore <lb/>
            affirm most assuredly that one who I know has been called <lb/>
            by the Lord, will not live long."</p>
          <p>Soon afterwards, the three young men experienced differ­ <lb/>
            ent fates, corresponding with what each had related. The <lb/>
            first was severely wounded while engaged in a hostile inroad, <lb/>
            and died without having confessed and received the viati­ <lb/>
            cum. Baldwin, Ralph de Conches' son-in-law, took the sign <lb/>
            of the cross on his left shoulder,1 and, on the summons of <lb/>
            Pope Urban, joined the pilgrimage against the infidels. In <lb/>
            that expedition he distinguished himself beyond all his <lb/>
            compeers, being gloriously sustained by the Divine cross- <lb/>
            bearer he had seen in his dream. First, he was made duke <lb/>
            of Rages, that is of Edessa, a most flourishing city, and some <lb/>
            years afterwards, on the death of his brother, he was elected <lb/>
            king of Jerusalem, where he long reigned. He was con­ <lb/>
            stantly engaged in wars with the infidels, in which, by <lb/>
            God's help, he nobly triumphed. As to Roger, he took to <lb/>
            his bed the same year the visions were seen, and having de- <note type="footnote"> 1 Every one knows that this was the badge of the Crusaders. Baldwin, <lb/>

          <p>AT the same time, Prince Henry ably governed the Coten­ <lb/>
            tin, and stood on his guard with great firmness against his <lb/>
            brothers. He was exasperated with the duke for the cap­ <lb/>
            tivity he had recently undergone at his hands. He was no <lb/>
            less at variance with King William in regard to his mother's <lb/>
            lands in England, of which his brother had disseised him, <lb/>
            and then granted them to Robert Fitz Hamon.1 In this <lb/>
            state of affairs, he kept his fortresses always prepared for <lb/>
            war, and wisely conciliated the favour of several of his <lb/>
            father's barons, who became his adherents. Among his <lb/>
            principal castles were Avranches, Cherbourg, Coutances, <lb/>
            and Gavrai: while Count Hugh,2 Richard de Reviers,3 and <lb/>
            the other lords of the Cotentin, except Robert de Mowbray,4 <lb/>
            joined him, and gathering aid on all sides, either by fair <lb/>
            words or rewards, his strength was daily on the increase. <lb/>
            Normandy was therefore a prey to unceasing calamities, and <lb/>
            the infernal furies made human beings, villages, and houses, <lb/>
            the victims of fire and slaughter.</p>

            as subscribing the charter of the A bbaye-aux Dames in 1082, was descended, <lb/>
            it is said, from Osmond de Centevilles, viscount de Vernon, and a niece of <lb/>
            the duchess Gonnor ; but this descent is very doubtful, as far as the male <lb/>
            line is concerned. The castellans of Vernon were not called Osmund, but <lb/>
            Hugh and William, and the latter survived to the conquest. As to the <lb/>
            female line, there is more probability, and our author's account of the <lb/>
            descent is confirmed by a document in the chartulary of Carisbrook, which <lb/>
            calls Richard de Reviers nephew of William Fitz-Osberne, who was him­ <lb/>

            almost every part of Normandy, and having gained over the <lb/>
            barons by means of his wealth, the province, in which its <lb/>
            own prince had lost all power, lay at his feet. Even the <lb/>
            citizens of Rouen, allured by the royal promises and bribes, <lb/>
            began to talk of deposing Robert, and consulted the means <lb/>
            of giving up the capital of Normandy, with their drowsy duke, <lb/>
            to the king. Conan, son of Gilbert Pilet,was at the head of the <lb/>
            conspirators ; a person of great influence, as he was the rich­ <lb/>
            est man in Rouen. Having made a league with the king for <lb/>
            putting him in possession of the place, his immense wealth <lb/>
            made him very powerful, and enabled him proudly to main­ <lb/>
            tain in his household a crowd of soldiers and retainers in <lb/>
            opposition to the duke. The greatest part of the townsmen <lb/>
            were of his faction; some however were for maintaining <lb/>
            their allegiance to the duke, and resisted and hindered by all <lb/>
            the obstacles in their power his traitorous design. But <lb/>
            Conan, relying on the concurrence of his fellow citizens, <lb/>
            fixed a time, and on the appointed day summoned the <lb/>
            king's troops from Gournai, and the other fortified places <lb/>
            which were in their possession, directing them to march on <lb/>
            Rouen without loss of time. Meanwhile, the duke, discover­ <lb/>
            ing the serious conspiracy on foot against him, called to his <lb/>
            councils his most trusted friends. In this juncture he made <lb/>
            alliances with his brother Henry and some others with <lb/>
            whom he had been at variance, and despatched hasty mes­ <lb/>
            sengers to William, count of Evreux, Robert de Belèsme, <lb/>
            William de Breteuil, Gilbert de Laigle, and his other <lb/>
            adherents, to inform them of his danger. Henry was the <lb/>
            first to come to his succour, bringing a reinforcement which <lb/>
            enabled him to inflict condign punishment on the traitor <lb/>
            Conan.</p>
          <p>On the 3rd of November Gilbert de Laigle arrived with <lb/>
            a troop of horse for the duke's service, and crossing the <lb/>
            bridge over the Seine reached Rouen on the southern side <lb/>
            at the same time that Reynold de Warrenne,2 at the head of <note type="footnote">1 Gilbert's cavalry approached Rouen on the south side, by the bridge <lb/>
            over the Seine, which then stood on the same spot as that afterwards <lb/>
            erected by the Empress Matilda in 1167, where the suspension bridge now <lb/>
            stands. Not only the bridge, but great part of what is now the rue Grand- <lb/>

            three hundred men-at-arms, galloped up to the gate of <lb/>
            Chaux.1 Upon this Gilbert shouted to his followers: " Be <lb/>
            on the alert, and get your arms in order, there is no time <lb/>
            for delay; see, the enemy is approaching from the south to <lb/>
            attack us, and our gallant comrades are rapidly advancing <lb/>
            from the west to our support; be ready then to 'receive <lb/>
            both our allies and our enemies as we ought; open your <lb/>
            ranks to admit our friends, and close them firmly against <lb/>
            our foes." One body of the townsmen fled to arms to resist <lb/>
            Gilbert and his troop, while others flocked to the western <lb/>
            gate, and set to work to force it open and give admission to <lb/>
            Reynold and his followers.' Besides this, some of the king's <lb/>
            adherents had already contrived to find their way into the <lb/>
            place, and having watched secretly for the moment of <lb/>
            action, were quite ready to support the rebellion, waiting <lb/>
            with impatience the delay of the outbreak.</p>
          <p>At last the tumult began to rage both among the troops <lb/>
            and the citizens, whose shouts were heard on all sides, the <lb/>
            whole place being thrown into confusion, and venting its <lb/>
            fury in mutual attacks ; for many of the townsmen fought at <lb/>
            both the gates against their relations and neighbours, one <lb/>
            part rallying for the duke, the other for the king. The <lb/>
            duke perceiving the struggle that was taking place in the <lb/>
            city issued forth from the castle,2 with his brother Henry <lb/>
            and his troops, and hastened to the succour of his party in <lb/>
            the town. But while all was in the confusion of this wild <lb/>
            tumult, and the citizens hardly knew which side to take, <lb/>
            the duke was persuaded by his friends to make his escape <lb/>
            with a few followers, from apprehension that he was fool­ <lb/>

            honour, and to the eternal ridicule of all the Normans. He <lb/>
            therefore went out at the east gate,1 and was dutifully re­ <lb/>
            ceived as their lawful sovereign by the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            suburban village, called Mal-Palu.2 A boat was then got <lb/>
            ready, and embarking on the Seine he left the storm of bat­ <lb/>
            tle behind, and proceeded by. water, in great alarm, to the <lb/>
            village of Emendreville.3 He was received on his landing <lb/>
            by William d'Arques, a monk of Molême,4 and waited there, <lb/>
            in the church of Notre-Dame-du-Pré,5 the issue of the <lb/>
            insurrection.</p>
          <p>Gilbert de Laigle, having forced an entrance through the <lb/>
            southern gate by the intrepidity of his followers, aided by <lb/>
            the exertions of the citizens who had not taken the side of <lb/>
            the traitors, he joined Prince Henry and the duke's other <lb/>
            auxiliaries, and charged the rebels who had possession of <lb/>
            the city. These presumptuous and guilty traitors, failing <lb/>
            in their wicked enterprise, the party of the duke now took <lb/>
            courage, and Gilbert furiously assaulted and crushed the <lb/>
            enemy. There was great slaughter of the townsmen, and <lb/>
            Conan, the leader of the insurgents, was taken prisoner <lb/>
            with many others. The city resounded with cries of grief <lb/>
            and terror, the women making loud lamentations, while the <lb/>
            men were fighting, falling, and fleeing. The innocent and <lb/>
            guilty alike were everywhere butchered, or captured or <lb/>
            driven to flight. When it appeared that the citizens were <lb/>
            divided among themselves, and that severe misfortunes were <lb/>
            impending, the royal troops withdrew in confusion, and <lb/>
            hastily gaining the shelter of the neighbouring woods, con­ <lb/>
            cealed themselves there until under cover of night, they, <lb/>
            with some difficulty, escaped the risk of death or captivity.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Conan was conveyed by the victors into the <lb/>
            castle, and Prince Henry having taken him to the summit of <lb/>
            the tower said to him ironically: " See, Conan, what a beauti­ <lb/>

            flows the Seine, abounding in fish, washing the city walls, <lb/>
            and bearing daily on its bosom ships loaded with rich <lb/>

            cal insult, groaned aloud, and imploring his clemency, said: <lb/>
            " I confess my guilt, which has justly subjected me to con­ <lb/>
            demnation, but I beg for mercy, in the name of God, the <lb/>
            Creator of all things. I will give, my lord, for my ransom, <lb/>
            all the gold and silver which can be found in my own coffers <lb/>
            and in those of my friends, and I will efface the crime of <lb/>
            my disloyalty by dutiful allegiance to the end of my days." <lb/>
            Henry, however, replied: " By the soul of my mother,2 I <lb/>
            will take no ransom for a traitor; the death he has deserved <lb/>
            shall be instant." Then Conan cried aloud with a lament­ <lb/>
            able voice: " For the love of God, allow me first to have a <lb/>
            confessor." But Henry, impatient to avenge his brother's <lb/>
            wrongs, in the fury of his passion paid no regard to the <lb/>
            prayers of the wretched man, and seizing him with both <lb/>
            hands, dashed him backward from the tower window. The <lb/>
            wretch's limbs were broken by the fearful fall, but he had <lb/>
            ceased to live before he reached the ground. The corpse <lb/>
            was fastened to the tail of a horse, and dragged with dis­ <lb/>
            grace through all the streets of Rouen, to strike terror into <lb/>

            Breteuil bad arrived, and they treated the inhabitants of <lb/>
            Rouen as if they had been aliens and robbers, carrying them <lb/>
            off and throwing them into loathsome dungeons. Wil­ <lb/>
            liam,' son of Ansger, one of the richest of the citizens, was, <lb/>
            led away captive by William de Breteuil, and after long <lb/>
            undergoing the horrors of a prison, was permitted to ran­ <lb/>
            som himself for three thousand livres.1 Thus the people of <lb/>
            Belèsme and Laigle, and the duke's other auxiliaries, exer­ <lb/>
            cised the greatest cruelties against their own fellow country­ <lb/>

            Normandy, dragging them away captives, and stripped of <lb/>
            everything as if they had been barbarian enemies.</p>
          <p>To what calamities was now reduced that proud Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy which so lately triumphed in the conquest of Eng­ <lb/>
            land, and destroying or expelling her native sons, usurped <lb/>
            their lands and their government! The prodigious wealth <lb/>
            which was wrung from others, and enriched by which she <lb/>
            exalted herself to her own destruction, has now, so far from <lb/>
            turning to her advantage, become the source of the severest <lb/>
            torments. Now, like Babylon, she drinks herself of the cup <lb/>
            of tribulation, which she gave to others. At the sight of so <lb/>
            many evils the impoverished clergy weeps, the convents of <lb/>
            monks lament, and the helpless people are everywhere deso­ <lb/>
            late and sorrowful. They only rejoice, and their triumph <lb/>
            will be of short duration, who can rob and thieve without <lb/>
            restraint. Alas! the respect for the priesthood, to which <lb/>
            once all did reverence, is nearly extinct in the flood of <lb/>
            calamities which so violently rages. Why have the furies <lb/>
            such unbounded licence to revel in Normandy, crushing its <lb/>
            inhabitants and overwhelming them in its ruins ? In the <lb/>
            days when there was no king or ruler in Jerusalem, the re­ <lb/>
            bellious people sacrificed to the golden calves of Jeroboam <lb/>

            in his poem:1 <lb/>
            Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts, <lb/>
            And grief and joy : nor can the grovelling mind <lb/>
            In the dark dungeon of the limbs confined, <lb/>
            Assert its native skies, or own its heavenly kind. <lb/>
            Those who are plunged in the gloom of the world's troubles <lb/>
            can neither enjoy the light of true wisdom nor extricate <lb/>
            themselves from the snares of vice. I see many passages in <lb/>
            the sacred writings which are so adapted to the circum­ <lb/>
            stances of the present times, that they seem parallel. But <lb/>
            I leave to studious persons the task of inquiry into these <lb/>
            allegorical quotations and the interpretations applicable to <lb/>
            the state of mankind, and will endeavour to continue the <lb/>

            purpose to relate the contests and calamities of the people <lb/>
            of Oxmes.2 Robert de Belèsme built a castle on an elevated <lb/>
            spot which is commonly called Fourches, and, transferring <lb/>
            there the inhabitants of Vignats, sought to reduce all the <lb/>
            neighbours under his tyranny. He erected another fortress <lb/>
            called Château Goutier,3 at La Courbe,4 on the river Orne, <lb/>
            by which he would be enabled to impose his yoke, however <lb/>
            unjustly, on all the district of the Houlme.5 Thus aggran­ <lb/>
            dized far beyond his parentage and ancestors, he attacked his <note type="footnote"> 1 Hinc metuunt, cupiuntque ; dolent, gaudentque ; neque auras <lb/>

            equals almost every where in Normandy, where a protector of <lb/>
            just rights was not to be found, and began to harass his im­ <lb/>
            mediate neighbours. Finding this, the Norman nobles were <lb/>
            much disturbed, and their disquietudes grew to such a pitch <lb/>
            that they had long and frequent consultations on the subject <lb/>
            of resisting these inroads. The first to take arms, because they <lb/>
            were the nearest to the tyrant's borders and most exposed <lb/>
            to his nefarious attempts, were Hugh de Grantmesnill and <lb/>
            Richard de Courci,2 who drew supplies of arms and pro­ <lb/>
            visions to their castles and strengthened the garrisons. <lb/>
            These knights were now grey-headed, but their spirit was <lb/>
            high and noble, and their intimate connection increased <lb/>
            their power; for Robert, Hugh's son, had married Hugh's <lb/>
            daughter,3 and she had borne her husband five sons.</p>
          <p>The noble Hugh de Grantmesnil was in his youth distin­ <lb/>
            guished for his valour, and married a very beautiful lady, <lb/>
            Adeliza,4 daughter of Ivo, count de'Beaumont, by whom he <lb/>
            had Robert, William, Hugh, Ivo, and Aubrey ; Adeline, <lb/>
            Havise, Rohais, Matilda, and Agnes. This large and <lb/>
            promising family was a prey to various misfortunes, so that <lb/>
            none of them except Robert lived to old age. He was the <lb/>
            eldest, and, surviving all his brothers and sisters, was thrice <lb/>
            married before he was advanced in years. His first wife <lb/>
            was Agnes, daughter of Ranulf of Bayeux,5 the second, <lb/>
            Emma, daughter of Robert D'Estoteville,6 and he married <lb/>

          <p>In the year, therefore, of our Lord 1091, the thirteenth <lb/>
            indiction, in the month of January, the duke laid siege to <lb/>
            Courci,6 but unwilling to come to extremities with his great <lb/>
            nobles, he took no measures for closely investing the be­ <lb/>
            sieged. Robert, however, used every resource of open attack <lb/>
            and stratagem against the enemy for three weeks, employing <lb/>
            various engines of war in his assaults on the fortress; but <lb/>
            the garrison being numerous and making a resolute defence, <lb/>
            he was repulsed with shame. He caused a vast machine, <note type="footnote"> 1 Roger and Arnulph de Montgomery, improperly called earls by the <lb/>

            and filled it with all kinds of warlike instruments, but even <lb/>
            this failed of compelling the garrison to submit; for as <lb/>
            often as he began an assault on Courci, the powerful force <lb/>
            from Grantmesnil hastened to the rescue, and charging the <lb/>
            assailants with fury drew them off from their intended <lb/>
            attack. Meanwhile the garrison took prisoners William de <lb/>
            Ferrers2 and William de Rupière,3 whose ransoms were a <lb/>
            great assistance to the besieged. But the lot of war is <lb/>
            uncertain, and the victors often have to yield to those they <lb/>
            have defeated. Thus Ivo, Hugh's son,4 and Richard, Gil­ <lb/>
            bert's son,5 and several others, were made prisoners by the <lb/>
            besiegers, and had some experience of the horrors of Robert <lb/>
            de Belèsme’s dungeons. Hugh de Grantmesnil did not <lb/>
            bear arms himself, on account of his advanced age, but in <lb/>
            council his shrewdness and wisdom enabled him to take the <lb/>
            lead. The long continuance of the siege caused him ex­ <lb/>
            treme pain, and in consequence he sent the following <lb/>
            message to the duke who was engaged in it: "I long <lb/>
            served your father and grandfather, and suffered much in <lb/>
            their service. I have also been always loyal to you. What <lb/>
            have I done ? in what have I given you offence ? how have <lb/>
            I merited at your hands this hostile attack ? I openly <lb/>
            acknowledge the fealty I owe you as my liege-lord, and on <lb/>
            that account I will not appear in arms against you; but I <lb/>
            offer you two hundred livres to withdraw where it may suit <lb/>
            your pleasure for one single day, that I may take that <lb/>
            opportunity of fighting Robert de Belèsme: it is clear <lb/>
            enough, that his principal reliance is upon your protection, <lb/>

            the castle gate and the assailants' belfry, and there the baker <lb/>
            baked the bread required for the use of the garrison, because <lb/>
            the siege was begun in such haste that they had no time to <lb/>
            construct an oven within their new defences. It followed <lb/>
            therefore that the thickest of the fight often raged around <lb/>
            this oven, much blood was shed there, and many spirits <lb/>
            departed by violence from the prison of the flesh. For the <lb/>
            people of Courci stood in arms to defend their bread, while <lb/>
            Belèsme’s followers tried to carry it off, so that many <lb/>
            desperate conflicts occurred. It happened that one day <lb/>
            while the loaves were being baked in the oven, and the two <lb/>
            hostile parties were engaged in a violent quarrel, the troops <lb/>
            on both sides came up, and a desperate conflict ensued, in <lb/>
            which twenty men were killed and more wounded, who <lb/>
            never tasted the bread their blood had purchased. Mean­ <lb/>
            while, the friends of the besieged daily entered the castle <lb/>
            in sight of the besiegers, and the duke taking no care to <lb/>
            prevent it, conveyed to their comrades fresh supplies of <lb/>
            arms and provisions to give them courage and support.</p>
          <p>On one occasion, Robert and his troops having been <lb/>
            repulsed from an assault, those who pursued them made a <lb/>
            squire mount into the belfry and set fire to it on the north <lb/>
            side. The machine was therefore burnt by the righteous <lb/>

            too powerful and caused them to be rejected. He was also <lb/>
            much distressed at a gross insult offered him by Robert de <lb/>
            Belèsme. A certain youth who was in the bishop's service <lb/>
            was one day riding through the camp amusing himself in a <lb/>
            boyish way, when Robert caused him to be pulled off the <lb/>
            horse and thrown into prison, retaining also the horse for <lb/>
            his own service. The boy was called Richard de Gaprée, he <lb/>
            was son of Sevald, and his relations had long struggled with <lb/>
            all their might to defend themselves from Robert's encroach­ <lb/>
            ments. When the bishop heard that his clerk was arrested <lb/>
            by Robert without any cause of offence, he commanded him <lb/>
            to release him instantly, or otherwise he would lay the <lb/>
            whole army under an interdict. After some days the young <lb/>
            clerk was set at liberty, and the bishop was carried back in <lb/>
            a languishing disorder to his own see at Séez. He then <lb/>
            received the holy sacraments and died surrounded by his <lb/>
            disciples on the tenth of the calends of February [23rd Jan­ <lb/>

          <p>The same week,2 William Rufus, king of England, crossed <lb/>
            over to Normandy with a great fleet. The duke was alarmed <lb/>
            at his arrival, and with Robert de Belèsme and the other <lb/>
            besiegers retired from Conches, and every one went to his <lb/>
            own home. Almost all the Norman lords presently paid <lb/>
            their court to William with great zeal, offering him presents <lb/>
            in the expectation of receiving still greater in return. The <lb/>
            French also, and the Bretons and Flemings, as well as many <lb/>
            from the neighbouring provinces, when they heard that <lb/>
            William was residing at Eu in Normandy, resorted to him. <lb/>
            They admired his great magnificence, and, on their return <lb/>
            home, exalted him above all their own princes for his <lb/>
            wealth and generosity. At last, the two brothers met <lb/>
            amicably at Rouen and were reconciled, their former <lb/>
            quarrels being buried in oblivion. At this interview the <lb/>
            duke received presents of great value from the king, and <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>I CONSIDER that I ought not to suppress and pass over in <lb/>
            silence what happened to a certain priest of the diocese of <lb/>
            Liseux in the begining of January.2 In a village called <lb/>
            Bonneval there was a priest named Walkelin who served <lb/>
            the church of St. Aubin of Anjou, who from a monk became <lb/>
            bishop and confessor.3 At the commencement of the month <lb/>
            of January, 1091, this priest was summoned in the night <lb/>
            time, as the occasion required, to visit a sick man who lived <lb/>
            at the furthest extremity of his parish. As he was pursu­ <lb/>
            ing his solitary road homewards, far from any habitation of <lb/>
            man, he heard a great noise like the tramp of a numerous <lb/>
            body of troops, and thought within himself that the sounds <lb/>
            proceeded from the army of Robert de Belèsme on their <lb/>
            march to lay seige to the castle of Courci.4 The moon, <note type="footnote"> 1 From the last day of January, 1091, to the 1st of August in the <lb/>

            terms of the arrangement made between the two brothers. It was agreed, </note><note type="footnote"> 1. That the duke should cede to William the county of Eu, the abbeys <lb/>

            being in her eighth day in the constellation of the Ram, shed a <lb/>
            clear light, so that it was easy to find the way. Now the priest <lb/>
            was young, undaunted, and bold, and of a powerful and <lb/>
            active frame of body. However, he hesitated when the <lb/>
            sounds, which seemed to proceed from troops on the march <lb/>
            first reached his ears, and began to consider whether he <lb/>
            should take to flight to avoid being laid hold of and discour­ <lb/>
            teously stripped by the worthless camp followers, or man­ <lb/>
            fully stand on his defence if any one molested him. Just <lb/>
            then he espied four medlar-trees' in a field at a good distance <lb/>
            from the path, and determined to seek shelter behind them, <lb/>
            as fast as he could, until the cavalry had passed. But as he <lb/>
            was running he was stopped by a man of enormous stature, <lb/>
            armed with a massive club, who, raising his weapon above <lb/>
            his head, shouted to him, " Stand! Take not a step further!" <lb/>
            The priest, frozen with terror, stood motionless, leaning on <lb/>
            his staff. The gigantic club-bearer also stood close to him, <lb/>
            and, without offering to do him any injury, quietly waited <lb/>
            for the passage of the troop.2 And now, behold, a great <lb/>
            crowd of people came by on foot, carrying on their heads <lb/>
            and shoulders, sheep, clothes, furniture, and moveables of all <lb/>
            descriptions, such as robbers are in the habit of pillaging. <lb/>
            All were making great lamentations and urging one another <lb/>
            to hasten their steps. Among them the priest recognized a <lb/>
            number of his neighbours who had lately died, and heard them <lb/>
            bewailing the excruciating sufferings with which they were <lb/>
            tormented for their evil deeds. They were followed by a <note type="footnote"> course of the week before Twelfthday. This was not Robert de Belèsme’s <lb/>
            road to Gourd, but terror seems to have already turned the head of the <lb/>

            called Fosses-Malades (on account of the adjoining graves in which the <lb/>
            dead were buried during a pestilence which ravaged the parish), when he <lb/>
            fell in with some thirty men, dressed in red, some of whom were on foot <lb/>
            and the rest on horseback. These men led the curé to the top of the field, <lb/>
            and solicited him to abjure his religion and deny God. Their instances <lb/>

            troop of corpse-bearers, who were joined by the giant <lb/>
            already mentioned. These carried as many as fifty biers, <lb/>
            each of which was borne by two bearers. On these were <lb/>
            seated a number of men of the size of dwarfs, but whose <lb/>
            heads were as large as barrels. Two Ethiopians also carried <lb/>
            an immense trunk of a tree, to which a poor wretch was <lb/>
            rudely bound, who, in his tortures filled the air with fearful <lb/>
            cries of anguish; for a horrible demon sat on the same <lb/>
            trunk and goaded his loins and back with red-hot spurs <lb/>
            until the blood streamed from them. Walkelin distinctly <lb/>
            recognized in this wretch the assassin of Stephen the priest, <lb/>
            and was witness to the intolerable tortures he suffered for <lb/>
            the innocent blood he shed two years before, since which he <lb/>
            had died without penance for so foul a crime.</p>
          <p>Then followed a crowd of women who seemed to the <lb/>
            priest to be innumerable. They were mounted on horseback, <lb/>
            riding in female fashion, with women's saddles which were <lb/>
            stuck with red-hot nails. The wind often lifted them a <lb/>
            cubit from their saddles, and then let them drop again on <lb/>
            the sharp points. Their haunches thus punctured with the <lb/>
            burning nails, and suffering horrible torments from the <lb/>
            wounds and the scorching heat, the women pitiably ejacu­ <lb/>
            lated, woe! woe! and made open confession of the sins for <lb/>
            which they were punished, undergoing in this manner fire <lb/>
            and stench and unutterable tortures for the obscene allure­ <lb/>
            ments and filthy delights to which they had abandoned them­ <lb/>
            selves when living among men. In this company the priest <lb/>
            recognized several noble ladies, and beheld the palfreys and <lb/>
            mules with the women's litters of others who were still alive.</p>
          <p>The priest stood fixed to the spot at this spectacle, his <lb/>
            thoughts deeply engaged in the reflections it suggested. <lb/>
            Presently, however, he saw pass before him a numerous com­ <lb/>
            pany of clergy and monks, with their rulers and judges, the <lb/>
            bishops and abbots carrying croziers in their hands. The <lb/>
            clergy and bishops wore black copes, and the abbots and <lb/>
            monks cowls of the same hue. They all groaned and wailed, <lb/>
            and some of them called to Walkelin, and implored him, in <lb/>
            the name of their former friendship, to pray for them. The <lb/>

            ward appearances, God searcheth the heart. In the realms <lb/>
            of eternal bliss the dear light of an endless day is shed on all <lb/>
            around, and the children of the kingdom triumph in the joys <lb/>
            which attend perfect holiness. Nothing that is unrighteous <lb/>
            is done there; nothing that is polluted can enter there ; no <lb/>
            uncleanness, no impurity, is there found. All the dross of <lb/>
            carnal desires is therefore consumed in the fires of purga­ <lb/>
            tory, and purified by sufferings of various degrees as the <lb/>
            Judge eternal ordains. So that as a vessel cleansed from <lb/>
            rust and thoroughly polished is laid up in a treasury, so the <lb/>
            soul, purified from all taint of sin, is admitted into Paradise, <lb/>
            where it enjoys perfect happiness unalloyed by fear or <lb/>
            care.</p>
          <p>The priest, trembling at these appalling scenes, still <lb/>
            rested on his staff, expecting apparitions still more terrible. <lb/>
            And now there followed an immense army in which no <lb/>
            colour was visible, but only blackness and fiery flames, All <lb/>
            were mounted on great war-horses, and fully armed as if <lb/>
            they were prepared for immediate battle, and they carried <lb/>
            black banners. There were seen Richard and Baldwin, the <note type="footnote"> 1 Dante did not scruple to assign a special place of torment not only in <lb/>

            sons of Count Gilbert,1 who were lately dead, with so many <lb/>
            others that I cannot enumerate them. Among the rest, <lb/>
            was Landri of Orbec, who was killed the same year, and <lb/>
            who accosted the priest, and uttering horrible cries, charged <lb/>
            him with his commissions, urgently begging him to carry a <lb/>
            message to his wife. Upon this the troops who marched <lb/>
            before and after him interrupted his cries, and said to the <lb/>
            priest: " Believe not Landri, for he is a deceiver." This <lb/>
            man had been a viscount and a lawyer, and had raised him­ <lb/>
            self from a very low origin by his talents and merit.. He <lb/>
            decided causes and affairs according to his own pleasure, <lb/>
            and perverted judgment for bribes, actuated more by avarice <lb/>
            and duplicity than by a sense of what was right. He was <lb/>
            therefore justly devoted to flagrant punishment, and publicly <lb/>
            denounced by his associates as a liar. In this company no <lb/>
            one flattered him, and no one had recourse to his cunning <lb/>
            loquacity. He, who while it was in his power had shut his <lb/>
            ears to the cries of the poor, was now in his torments, <lb/>
            treated as an execrable wretch who was unfit to be heard.</p>
          <p>Walkelin having seen these countless troops of soldiers <lb/>
            pass, on reflection, said within himself: "Doubtless these <lb/>
            are Harlequin's people ;2 I have often heard of their being <lb/>
            seen, but I laughed at the stories, having never had any <lb/>
            certain proofs of such things. Now, indeed, I assuredly <lb/>
            behold the ghosts of the departed, but no one will believe <lb/>
            me when I tell the tale unless I can exhibit to mortal eyes <lb/>
            some tangible proof of what I have seen. I will therefore <lb/>
            mount one of the horses which are following the troop with­ <lb/>
            out any riders, and will take it home and show it my neigh­ <lb/>
            bours to convince them that I speak the truth." Accordingly <lb/>
            he forthwith snatched the reins of a black steed, but the <note type="footnote"> 1 Richard de Bienfaite and Baldwin de Meules, son of Gilbert, count de <lb/>

            animal burst violently from his hold and galloped away <lb/>
            among the troops of Ethiopians. The priest was disap­ <lb/>
            pointed at the failure of his enterprise ; but he was young, <lb/>
            bold, and light-hearted, as well as agile and strong. He <lb/>
            therefore stationed himself in the middle of the path, pre­ <lb/>
            pared for action, and the moment a horse came up, laid his <lb/>
            hand upon it. The horse stopped, ready for him to mount <lb/>
            without difficulty, at the same time snorting from his nos­ <lb/>
            trils a cloud of vapour as large as a full-grown oak. The <lb/>
            priest then placed his left foot in the stirrup, and, seizing <lb/>
            the reins, laid his hand on the saddle, but he instantly felt <lb/>
            that his foot rested on red-hot iron, and the hand with <lb/>
            which he held the bridle was frozen with insupportable <lb/>
            cold which penetrated to his vitals.</p>
          <p>While this was passing, four terrific knights came up and <lb/>
            uttering horrible cries, shouted to him : " What do you want <lb/>
            with our horses ? You shall come with us. No one of <lb/>
            our company had injured you, when you began laying your <lb/>
            hands on what belongs to us." The priest, in great alarm, <lb/>
            let go the horse, and three of the knights attempting to seize <lb/>
            him, the fourth said to them : " Let him go, and allow me to <lb/>
            speak with him, for I wish to make him the bearer of a mes­ <lb/>
            sage to my wife and children." He then said to the priest, <lb/>
            who stood trembling with fright: " Listen to me, I beseech <lb/>
            you, and tell my wife what I say." The priest replied: " I <lb/>
            know not who you are, or who is your wife." The knight <lb/>
            then said : “I am William de Glos,l son of Barno, and was <lb/>
            once the renowned steward of William de Breteuil and his <lb/>
            father William, earl of Hereford.2 While in the world I <lb/>
            abandoned myself to evil deeds and plunder, and was guilty <lb/>
            of more crimes than can be recounted. But, above all, I <lb/>
            am tormented for my usuries. I once lent money to a poor <lb/>
            man, and received as security a mill which belonged to him,' <lb/>
            and as he was not able to discharge the debt I kept the <lb/>
            mortgage property and left it to my heirs, disinheriting my <lb/>
            debtor's family. You see that I have in my mouth a bar <lb/>
            of hot iron from the mill, the weight of which I feel to be <lb/>
            more oppressive than the tower of Rouen. Tell, therefore, <note type="footnote"> 1 Glos-la-Ferrière, now Glos-sous-Laigle, in the neighbourhood of St. <lb/>

            ray wife Beatrice, and my son Roger, to afford me relief, by <lb/>
            speedily restoring to the right heir the pledge from which <lb/>
            they have received more than I advanced." The priest <lb/>
            replied : "William de Glos died long ago, and this is a com­ <lb/>
            mission which no Christian man can undertake. I know <lb/>
            neither who you are, or who are your heirs. If I should <lb/>
            venture to tell such a tale to Roger de Glos, or his brothers, <lb/>
            or to their mother, they would laugh me to scorn as one out <lb/>
            of his wits." However, William continued still to persist <lb/>
            in his earnest entreaties, and furnished him with many sure <lb/>
            and well-known tokens of his identity. The priest under­ <lb/>
            stood very well all he heard, but pretended not to compre­ <lb/>
            hend it. At length, overcome by importunities, he consented <lb/>
            to what the knight requested, and engaged to do what was <lb/>
            required. Upon this, William repeated again all he had <lb/>
            said, and impressed it on his companion during a long conver­ <lb/>
            satiQn. The priest, however, began to consider that he durst <lb/>
            not convey to any one the execrable message of a dammed <lb/>
            spirit.1 " It is not right," he said; " to publish such things ; <lb/>
            I will, on no account, tell to any one what you require of <lb/>
            me." Upon this, the knight was filled with rage, and seizing <lb/>
            him by the throat dragged him along on the ground, utter­ <lb/>
            ing terrible imprecations. The prisoner felt the hand which <lb/>
            grasped him burning like fire, and in this deep extremity cried <lb/>
            aloud: " Help me, O holy Mary, the glorious mother of <lb/>
            Christ." No sooner had he invoked the compassionate <lb/>
            mother than the aid of the Son of God was afforded him, <lb/>
            according to the Almighty's disposing will. For a horseman <lb/>
            immediately rode up, with a sword in his right hand, and <lb/>
            brandishing it over Roger's head, exclaimed: " Will ye kill <lb/>
            my brother, ye accursed ones ? Loose him and begone ! ” <lb/>
            The knights instantly fled and followed the black troops.</p>
          <p>When they had all passed by, the horseman, remaining <lb/>
            alone in the road with Walkelin, said to him, " Do you <lb/>
            not know me ?" the priest answered " No." The other <lb/>
            said: " I am Robert, son of Ralph le Blonde and your <note type="footnote"> 1 Biothanati; this word, which in its original signification was applied <lb/>
            to those who put an end to their own lives, means here the damned, the <lb/>

            brother." The priest was much astonished at this unex­ <lb/>
            pected occurrence, and much troubled at what he had seen <lb/>
            and heard, as we have just related, when the knight began <lb/>
            to remind him of a number of things which happened in <lb/>
            their youth, and to give him many well-known tokens. The <lb/>
            priest had a clear recollection of all that was told him, but <lb/>
            not daring to confess it, he stoutly denied all knowledge of <lb/>
            the circumstances. At length the knight said to him: " I <lb/>
            am astonished at your hardness of heart and stupidity; it <lb/>
            was I who brought you up on our parents' death, and loved <lb/>
            you more than any one living. I sent you to school in <lb/>
            France,1 supplied you plentifully with clothes and money, <lb/>
            and did all in my power to benefit you in every way. You <lb/>
            seem now to have forgotten all this, and will not even con­ <lb/>
            descend to recognise me. At length the priest, after being <lb/>
            abundantly furnished with exact particulars, became con­ <lb/>
            vinced by such certain proofs, and bursting into tears, <lb/>
            openly admitted the truth of what he had heard. His <lb/>
            brother then said: " You deserve to die, and to be dragged <lb/>
            with us to partake of the torments we suffer, because you <lb/>
            have rashly laid hands on things whieh belong to our repro­ <lb/>
            bate crew; no other living man ever dared to make such an <lb/>
            attempt. But the mass you sang to-day has saved you <lb/>
            from perishing. It is also permitted me thus to appear to <lb/>
            you, and unfold to you my wretched condition. After I <lb/>
            had conferred with you in Normandy, I took leave of you <lb/>
            and crossed over to England, where, by the Creator's order, <lb/>
            my life ended, and I have undergone intense suffering for <lb/>
            the grievous sins with which I was burdened. It is flaming <lb/>
            armour which you see us bear, it poisons us with an in­ <lb/>
            fernal stench, weighs us down with its intolerable weight, <lb/>
            and scorches us with heat which is inextinguishable! <lb/>
            Hitherto I have been tormented with unutterable suffer­ <note type="footnote"> the priory of Ixworth in Suffolk. There is also a Robert Le Blond, but <lb/>
            we are told that he was in possession of his manors in the time of Edward <lb/>

            vigorous priest of Bonneval, without a great difference in their ages. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This curious passage proves that, notwithstanding the high reputation <lb/>

            great torment to me, fell from my arm. I still, as you see, <lb/>
            carry a sword, but I confidently expect to be relieved of <lb/>
            that burden in the course of a year."</p>
          <p>While'the knight was thus talking, the priest attentively <lb/>
            listening to him espied a mass of clotted gore, in the <lb/>
            shape of a man's head, at the other's heels, round his spurs, <lb/>
            and in great amazement said to him : " Whose is this clotted <lb/>
            blood which clings to your spurs ? " The knight replied : <lb/>
            " It is not blood but fire; and it weighs me down more than <lb/>
            if I had Mount St. Michael to carry. Once I used sharp <lb/>
            and bright spurs when I was hurrying to shed blood, and <lb/>
            now I justly carry this enormous weight at my heels, which <lb/>
            is so intolerably burdensome, that I am unable to express <lb/>
            the severity of my sufferings. Men ought to reflect on these <lb/>
            things without ceasing, and to dread and beware lest they, <lb/>
            for their sins, should undergo such chastisements. I am <lb/>
            not permitted, my brother, to converse longer with you, for <lb/>
            I must hasten to follow this unhappy troop. Remember <lb/>
            me, I pray you, and give me the succour of your prayers and <lb/>
            alms. In one year after Palm Sunday I trust to be saved ; <lb/>
            and by the mercy of the Creator released from all my tor­ <lb/>
            ments. And you, consider well your own state, and pru­ <lb/>
            dently mend your life which is blemished by many vices, for <lb/>
            know, it will not be very long. Now be silent, bury in your <lb/>
            own bosom the things you have so unexpectedly seen and <lb/>
            heard, and do not venture to tell them to any one for three <lb/>
            davs."</p>
          <p>With these words the knight hastened away. The priest <lb/>
            was seriously ill for a whole week; as, soon as he began to <lb/>
            recover his strength, hewent to Lisieux and related all that had <lb/>
            happened to Bishop Gilbert,' in regular order, and obtained, <lb/>
            on his petition, the salutary remedies he needed. He after­ <lb/>

            what I have written, and more which has escaped my <lb/>
            memory, from his own mouth, and saw the mark on his face <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN the year of our Lord 1091, the thirteenth indiction, in <lb/>
            the month of January, William Rufus, king of England, <lb/>
            crossed over to Normandy with a large fleet, and upon hear­ <lb/>
            ing of his arrival Duke Robert abandoned the siege of <lb/>
            Courci, and Robert de Belèsme and his associates retreated. <lb/>
            The king remained in Normandy till August, and used his <lb/>
            royal authority in tranquillizing such of the insurgents as <lb/>
            were willing to listen to his advice. Meanwhile, Prince <lb/>
            Henry, who had serious causes of complaint against both his <lb/>
            brothers, and claimed some part of the ample territories of <lb/>
            his glorious father, but could obtain nothing from their <lb/>
            obstinate tenacity, collected troops in Brittany and Nor­ <lb/>
            mandy, and putting Coutances, Avranches, and his other <lb/>
            fortresses into a state of defence, prepared for war with all <lb/>
            his might. But Hugh, earl of Chester, and his other <lb/>
            adherents reflecting on his small means, and dreading the <lb/>
            vast wealth and mighty power of William Rufus, deserted <lb/>
            the illustrious prince while he was embarked in the war, and <lb/>
            surrendered their castles into the king's hands. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence, about the middle of Lent,1 King William and Duke <lb/>
            Robert laid siege to Mount St. Michael, where they block­ <lb/>
            aded their brother, and reduced him and his troops for nearly <lb/>
            fifteen days to great straits for want of water. The prudent <lb/>
            young prince, seeing himself thus pressed by his brothers <lb/>
            and deserted on all sides by his relations and friends, as well <lb/>
            as by the neighbours with whom he was leagued, and also <lb/>
            finding himself in want of almost all the necessaries of life, <lb/>
            weighed well in his own mind the state of affairs, and reflect­ <lb/>
            ing on the variety of human mischances, determined on <lb/>
            abandoning his rash enterprise and reserving himself for <lb/>
            better times. At length, therefore, he demanded from the <note type="footnote"> I Lent commenced in the year 1091, the 26th of February, and ended <lb/>

            besiegers free egress for himself and his allies from the <lb/>
            Mount, which they willingly granted, permitting him to <lb/>
            march out honourably with all his equipments.1 Henry, <lb/>
            having surrendered his fortresses, passed through Brittany, <lb/>
            returning thanks to the Bretons, who alone had rendered <lb/>
            him aid, and then crossed the borders of France. The illus­ <lb/>
            trious exile spent not quite two full years in the Vexin, <lb/>
            seeking an asylum in different places. Living in obscurity, <lb/>
            he was contented with a suite consisting of only one knight, <lb/>
            a clerk, and three squires. Thus a king's son learnt in <lb/>
            exile how to endure poverty, that when he became king him­ <lb/>
            self he might know how to compassionate the wretched and <lb/>
            the poor, succouring them in their distress or penury, by his <lb/>
            royal power or munificence, and, having himself experienced <lb/>
            the lot of the humble, might kindly sympathize with them.</p>
          <p>At this time Duke Robert ceded great part of Normandy <lb/>
            to King William, and for nearly two years the country was <lb/>
            free from hostilities. After the feast of Pentecost,2 William <lb/>
            the archbishop assembled at Rouen a synod of the bishops <lb/>
            and abbots, and consulted with his suffragans respecting the <lb/>
            bishopric of Séez. By the result of their deliberations, <lb/>
            Serlo, abbot of St. Evroult, was chosen bishop and the see of <lb/>
            Sèez committed to him ; much against his wishes. At length, <lb/>
            on the tenth of the calends of July [22nd June] the archbishop <lb/>
            summoned the monk just named to Rouen and gave him <lb/>
            canonical consecration in the church of St. Mary, mother of <lb/>
            God. The venerable Serlo bore worthily the burden of the <lb/>
            episcopacy thirty-two years and four months,3 and laboured, <lb/>
            with zeal and ability for the benefit of the church of God <lb/>
            both in prosperity and adversity. But he had some hard- <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author's account of the siege of Mount St. Michael hy the king <lb/>

            was besieging, contrasted with the goodness and affectionate language of <lb/>

            ened and insolent men in his diocese, such as Robert de <lb/>
            Bèlesme, Rotro de Mortagne and their fellows, who had <lb/>
            cruel feuds with each other, frequently violated the peace of <lb/>
            the church, dispersed by their hostile inroads the Lord's flock <lb/>
            who were redeemed by the blood of Christ, and oppressed <lb/>
            and made havoc of them by their various enterprises. <lb/>
            Serlo boldly bared the sword of the word of God against <lb/>
            these evil men, several times excommunicating them when <lb/>
            they persisted in their iniquities, but he seldom or ever was <lb/>
            able to teach wisdom or preserve in peace his rebellious <lb/>
            subjects, so that during the whole period he held the see he <lb/>
            was perpetually involved in tumults and disturbances, and <lb/>
            on several occasions, when Robert's fury was highest, was <lb/>
            compelled to become an exile in England or Italy, such was <lb/>
            the state of alarm and distress in which he lived.</p>
          <p>The abbey of St. Evroult, when their late ruler was raised <lb/>
            to the bishopric of Séez being anxious about a successor, <lb/>
            invited their former pastor to Ouche on the twelfth of the <lb/>
            calends of August [the 21st July], and having observed a <lb/>
            fast for three days, began to treat of the election of an abbot. <lb/>
            There were present also three abbots, Fulk of Dive, <lb/>
            Arnulf of Troarn, and Ralph of Séez.1 Having read the <lb/>
            lesson concerning the apointment of an abbot in the rule of <lb/>
            St. Benedict, the lord Roger de Sap, was chosen abbot of <lb/>
            St. Evroult. He was a monk of the same house, simple <lb/>
            minded, eminent for his learning, his great worth, and gentle <lb/>
            manners. Then Herman the prior, with Arnold de Tilleul, <lb/>
            and several others conducted him to the duke's court,-but <lb/>
            were disappointed in their hope of finding him in Normandy. <lb/>
            Secret conspiracies had been formed by the islanders against <lb/>
            the peace and security of the realm, on receiving sudden <lb/>
            information of which, both the brothers very unexpectedly <lb/>
            passed over to England,2 to the surprise of all the world. <lb/>
            In consequence Herman returned to conduct affairs at St. <note type="footnote"> 1 Fulk, abbot of Notre-Dame de St. Pierre-sur-Dive. </note><note type="footnote"> Arnulph, abbot of Troarn, 1088—1 112. </note><note type="footnote"> Ralph d'Escures, abbot of Séez, 1089—1110. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The two brothers went to England in the early part of August, in <lb/>

            The irruption took place in the month of May; and before the arrival of <lb/>
            William Rufus, Malcolm, finding a more determined resistance than he <lb/>
            expected, had already retired to his own country with very little booty. </note> <pb n="523"/>

            Evroult, while Arnold with the abbot elect followed the <lb/>
            princes across the sea. On their arrival at the royal vill, <lb/>
            called Windsor, they exhibited to duke Robert the act con­ <lb/>
            taining the election by the monks, confirmed by the autho­ <lb/>
            rity of the bishop of Séez and the three abbots. The duke <lb/>
            gave his willing consent to the appointment aud committed <lb/>
            to Roger before named, by delivery of the pastoral staff, as <lb/>
            the custom then was, the monastic cure in exterior affairs. <lb/>
            He also issued his mandate to the bishop of Lisieux, requir­ <lb/>
            ing him to perform all that was canonically necessary in the <lb/>
            business. King William also at the same time received the <lb/>
            monk and abbot elect with great courtesy and confirmed the <lb/>
            grants of all that his father and his barons bad formerly <lb/>
            given to the abbey of St. Evroult, ratifying them of his royal <lb/>
            authority by a fresh charter.1</p>
          <p>Having accomplished the object of their journey, Roger <lb/>
            returned to Ouche on the fifteenth of the calends of January <lb/>
            [18th December], and being received by the brethren with <lb/>
            due solemnity, governed the abbey thirty-four years.2 He <lb/>
            admitted a hundred and fifteen postulants to be monks of <lb/>
            that house. The changes of fortune were exhibited in their <lb/>
            various lives; for some of them, being eminent for their <lb/>
            virtues, with God's help, obtained the reward of their <lb/>
            heavenly vocation, while others through the snares of Satan <lb/>
            relapsed into the foul depths of sin to receive their deserts <lb/>
            from the righteous Judge.</p>
          <p>Six of the monks admitted by the venerable Roger we <lb/>
            have seen become abbots, namely, Warin des Essarts, <lb/>
            Geoffrey of Orleans, Gilbert de Glos, Robert de Pruniers,3 <lb/>
            William de Bas, and Lewis. Of these, Warin succeeded his <lb/>
            master, and governed the abbey of St. Evroult many years ; <lb/>
            Robert de Pruniers ruled well Thorney abbey in England,4 <note type="footnote"> 1 This charter has not been preserved. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is not quite correct. It is very true that Abbot Roger survived <lb/>
            till the year 1126 or 1127; but at his own request his successor was nomi­ <lb/>

            one of the two churches of which belonged at this period to St. Evroult, <lb/>
            and was called Slus. Gervasius de Pruneleio.”—Le Prévost. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Robert was appointed abbot of Thorney (in Cambridgeshire), August <lb/>

            Geoffrey of Orleans was abbot of Croyland1 for nearly fifteen <lb/>
            years ; William Basset long governed the monastery of St. <lb/>
            Benedict at Hulm ;2 and Lewis,3 when by a decree of their <lb/>
            superiors, the canons were expelled from Bocherville, first <lb/>
            established the monastic rule with five monks in the <lb/>
            church of St. George the martyr. As for Gilbert de Glos, <lb/>
            a man of noble birth and great eloquence, he was abbot of <lb/>
            Lire for nearly ten years, much to its benefit. The monks <lb/>
            of St. Evroult were thus drawn forth from the recesses of <lb/>
            their monastery and raised to the ranks of the prelacy for <lb/>
            the general good, that they might shine as lights set in a <lb/>
            candlestick, and show the way of salvation to those who <lb/>
            strove to enter the house of the Lord by the way of righte­ <lb/>
            ousness. But unfortunately, the disturbances in worldly <lb/>
            affairs which take place from the negligence or misconduct <lb/>
            of earthly princes often interfere with ecclesiastical order and <lb/>
            monastic discipline, as was found by all who wished to devote <lb/>
            themselves to a religious life in Normandy and on its confines <lb/>
            in the time of Duke Robert and Philip king of France. <note type="footnote"> 1 Eulandensi, an error in the text for Crulandens, there being no <lb/>

            habit at St. Evroult, under Abbot Mainier, was made abbot of Croyland in <lb/>
            1109. We have learnt before (p. 86) that Ordericus, on a kind invitation <lb/>
            received from Abbot Geoffrey spent five weeks at Croyland, where he <lb/>
            wrote, at the request of the monks, his abridgment of the life of St. <lb/>

          <p>MESSRS. BELL and DALDY beg to announce that they have <lb/>
            purchased of Mr. H. G. Bohn, who is preparing to retire <lb/>
            from business, after forty years of successful enterprise, the <lb/>
            entire stock of his various Libraries, consisting of more <lb/>
            than 600 different works, and comprising nearly half a <lb/>
            million of volumes.</p>
          <p>These Libraries have been created by Mr. Bohn during <lb/>
            the past twenty years by an amount of energy and industry, <lb/>
            bibliographical knowledge and literary skill never before <lb/>
            united with the requisite amount of capital; and they repre­ <lb/>
            sent an accumulation of valuable works unexampled in the <lb/>
            history of literary undertakings.</p>
          <p>Though Mr. Bohn was not the first to recognize the <lb/>
            power of cheapness as applied to the production of books, <lb/>
            he was the first to address his efforts exclusively to works <lb/>
            of a standard character and enduring interest. He threw <lb/>
            himself into the movement with characteristic energy; and <lb/>
            in developing his aim he is known by those who have <lb/>
            watched the progress of cheap literature to have distanced <lb/>
            all competitors. During the time that his Libraries have <lb/>
            been before the public, he has carried into all classes in all <lb/>
            parts of the world where the English language is under­ <lb/>
            stood an unexampled choice of books, not only for students <lb/>
            and scholars, but for readers who merely seek amusement.</p>
          <p>Such a choice, so varied, and at so low a price, does not <lb/>
            exist in this country or elsewhere ; and Mr. Bohn is entitled <lb/>
            to the gratitude of all who value the humanizing effects of <lb/>
            literature. Since the commencement of these Libraries at <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="iv"/>
            least three million volumes have been issued, and these <lb/>
            may fairly be taken to represent thirty million readers.</p>
          <p>In accepting the responsibility of so large an under­ <lb/>
            taking, Messrs. Bell and Daldy desire to carry on the pro­ <lb/>
            jects of Mr. Bohn with the same spirit and energy which <lb/>
            have influenced him, and they are happy to announce they <lb/>
            will have the advantage of his bibliographical knowledge <lb/>
            and large experience.</p>
          <p>In addition to the Libraries of Mr. Bohn, this Catalogue <lb/>
            comprises the various Collections published by Messrs. <lb/>
            Bell and Daldy during the last nine years, and now in <lb/>
            progress.</p>
          <p>These Libraries and Collections together afford a choice <lb/>
            from about 800 volumes on general literature and educa­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>To assist purchasers in making their selections a classi­ <lb/>
            fied index is attached, by which they will be guided to the <lb/>
            subjects of the books.</p>
          <p>Messrs. Bell and Daldy venture to add, that the Aldine <lb/>
            Poets, Aldine Series, British Worthies, Elzevir Series, and <lb/>
            Pocket Volumes, are specially prepared for the lovers of <lb/>
            choice books, and are specimens of careful editing combined <lb/>
            with the most finished workmanship in all external features. <lb/>
            They believe that they are not surpassed in these respects <lb/>
            by any similar productions of the present day.</p>
          <p>Many of the above works are adapted for prizes and <lb/>
            presents; and they may be had through any bookseller, <lb/>
            bound in a suitable style, by giving a short notice.</p><pb n="v"/>
