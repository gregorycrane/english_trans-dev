<title type="main">REMARKS ON THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE ANABASIS.</title>
</head>
<p>A BIOGRAPHICAL Notice of Xenophon is prefixed to the second volume of this translation. Some remarks are here offered on the authorship of the " Anabasis."</p>
<p>A passage of the “Hellenica,” in which it is said that a narrative of the Expedition of Cyrus was written by Themistogenes of Syracuse, has given rise to the question1 whether the account of that expedition which we now have is that of Xenophon or that of Themistogenes.</p>
<p>When Xenophon, in the course of his narrative of events relating to Greece, comes to the time at which the expedition ot' Cyrus took place, he says,2 " How Cyrus collected an army, how he marched up the country with it against his brother, how the battle was fought, how Cyrus was killed, and how the Greeks afterwards effected a safe retreat to the sea, has been written by Themistogenes the Syracusan."</p>
<p>Suidas3 also says that " Themistogenes, a Syracusan historian, wrote the Anabasis of Cyrus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦτις ἐν το</foreign> IS <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ξενοφω̃ντος</foreign>
’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλληνικοῑς φέρεται</foreign>, and some other things concerning his own country." What sense is to be given to the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέρεται</foreign> in this passage, has been a subject of much doubt. If the phrase containing it be translated, with Morus, quae nominatur aut laudatur in Historiâ Graecâ, a sense is given to the verb for which there is no authority; and if it be rendered, with most interpreters, quae inserta legitur historiis Graecis, that is said which is not true. Kuster4 and Dindorf,5 therefore, suggest that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">̔Ελληνικοῑς</foreign>, which is not found in
<note type="footnote"> 1 Morus in Dissert. Hellenicis praemiss. c 6. Kühner Prolegom. in Anab. p. XVIII. </note>

<pb n="v"/>
the Paris manuscripts, should be struck out. The sense will then be, “which is inserted among the writings of Xenophon."</p>
<p>Suidas being thus interpreted, the two passages will concur in showing that a narrative of the "Anabasis" was written by Themistogenes. The next point to be considered is, whether that narrative which we now have is, or is not, the work of Themistogenes.</p>
<p>Plutarch, in his Considerations whether the Athenians were more renowned in Arms or in Letters,1 observes, in alluding to the historians, that “Xenophon was a subject of history for himself, for he wrote an account of the military matters which he successfully conducted, but represents that the account was written by Themistogenes the Syracusan, in order that he might have more credit if he spoke of himself as another person, giving to another the reputation of the work." The passage is somewhat obscure, for there is a word, such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγει</foreign>, wanting; I translate it in the sense in which it is taken by Leunclavius and Wyttenbach.</p>
<p>In agreement with this passage of Plutarch, Tzetzes, in his Chiliads,2 after observing that Phidias made two statues for a young man of whom he was fond, and for whose workmanship, it appears, they were to pass, says that " Xenophon did the same with regard to the Anabasis of Cyrus ; for he set a certain name to the work to please one whom he loved ; * * * it is the book of Themistogenes the Syracusan, and afterwards came to be commonly called the work of Xenophon ; so Plato the philosopher wrote his Dialogues under the names of his friends; and other writers have composed innumerable things in a similar way.” When he says that “it is the book of Themistogenes," <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ βιβλίον Θεμιστογένους ἐστι</foreign>, he can have n.; other meaning but that it was given to the world by Xenophon under the name of Themistogenes. A Scholium, which us appended to the passage by an unknown author, states the matter more briefly and clearly: “Xenophon inscribed the A nabasis of Cyrus with the name of Themistogenes, yet it ame to be commonly called afterwards the work of Xenophon.”</p>

<p>From these writers, then, Plutarch, Tzetzes, and his Scholiast. it would appear that the " Anabasis," or account of the expedition of Cyrus, was written by Xenophon, and published
<note type="footnote"> 1 c. i. </note>

<note type="footnote">2 vii.930. </note>

<pb n="vi"/>
as the work of Themistogenes. But from the passage of Xenophon, to which we ought to attribute more authority than to any others as also from that of Suidas, we may rather conceive, as Dindorf suggests, that there were two Anabases, the one written by Themistogenes, before Xenophon wrote the third book of the Hellenica, and to which Xenophon was then content to refer, and the other written by Xenophon himself subsequently to that time. Under this supposition, indeed, we must believe that Xenophon published the Anabasis at a very advanced period of life, while the composition seems to be that of a man in the full vigour of his faculties; but Sophocles, as Kühner1 observes, wrote with great spirit, after he was eighty years of age; and the Anabasis might have been written some years before Xenophon sent it out of his hands. If there were two, that of Themistogenes, from what Xenophon says of it, may have brought the Greeks only to the sea, or to Trebisond ; that of Xenophon is continued to their junction with Thibron. If there were but one, Xenophon may have published the first four books, at an earlier period, under the name of Themistogenes, and have afterwards added the three other books, and signified that the whole was his own.</p>
<p>One object of the author of the work which we have, observes Mitford,2 was to apologize for the conduct of Xenophon; in the latter part the narrative is constantly accompanied with a studied defence of his proceedings; the circumstances that produced his banishment from Athens, and whatever might excite jealousy against him at Lacedaemon, have been carefully considered ; if. therefore, Themistogenes wrote it, he may have written under the direction of Xenophon; if Xenophon wrote it, there may have been good reasons why, at the time of its publication, he should have wished it to pass under another person's name.</p>
<p>If there were two Anabases, we may suppose that Xenophon’s superseded that of Themistogenes, and caused it to be lost. The name of Themistogenes, as an author, is mentioned by no writer besides those whom we have noticed ; while that of Xenophon, as the author of the Anabasis, is specified, as Mitford and Krüger 3 observe, by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Strabo, Cicero, Diogenes Laertius, Lucian, Aelian, and Athenaeus,

<note type="footnote"> ' De Authent. Anab. p. 18. </note>

<pb n="vii"/>
besides the grammarians and lexicographers, Hesychius, Pollux, Harpocration, and Ammonius.</p>
<p>But no decisive opinion can be pronounced. The statement of Plutarch, which he gives, not as a conjecture of his own but as a matter of general belief in his day, and which is supported by Tzetzes and his Scholiast, may induce many readers, if not the majority, to suppose, with Weiske1 and Kühner, that there was probably but one Anabasis, that which we now have, and which, though the work of Xenophon, was, for whatever reasons on the part of the author, sent into the world as the composition of Themistogenes. The attractions of the subject, as Dr. Smith2 observes, might have induced more than one or two persons to write upon it.</p>
<p>Of the other work translated in this volume, no doubt has been expressed that Xenophon was the author. It shows what were the habits and conversation of him who taught that To know That which before us lies in daily life Is the prime wisdom ; who brought philosophy down from heaven to dwell with men ; and who was pronounced the wisest of men by the Delphic oracle, "because he judiciously made choice of human nature for the object of his thoughts, an inquiry into which a? much exceeds all other learning, as it is of more consequence to adjust the true nature and measures of right and wrong, than to settle the distances of the planets, and compute the time of their circumvolutions.”3 His doctrine was, <figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BELL_83_fig2.jpg"/></figure> On life, on morals, be thy thoughts employed; Leave to the schools their Atoms and their Void.</p>
<p>He gave indeed, it may be thought, too little encouragement to investigations in physical science. How far he recommended that mathematical studies should be pursued, may be seen in B. iv. c. 7. The best specimen of Socratic reasoning in the Memorabilia is the philosopher’s conversation with Euthydemus in B. iv. c. 2.

But as a Persian army could not subsist, or their cavalry act, within the wide range of these mountains, the Greeks, by ascending them, got rid of their dreaded enemy. And although, in the meantime, they had to contend with an enemy much more brave and persevering, their numbers were fewer, and they might reasonably expect an earlier escape from them than from the Persians. Had they known that the Tigris was fordable under the Zaco hills, and passed into Mesopotamia, they would still have had the Euphrates to cross, a yet more difficult river, in the line which they must have pursued. Therefore, according to our limited view of things, it appears that nothing less than such a barrier as these mountains presented, could have saved the Greeks from eventual destruction, from the attacks of the Persians."

The use of the preposition <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ</foreign>, indeed, is not very apparent, unless it be to signify that Seuthes drained the cup to the bottom. </note>

<note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κατεσκεδάσατο μετὰ τοῡτο τὸ κέρας</foreign>.] " It was a custom of the Thracians at their banquets, when the guests had drunk as much wine as they could, to pour the rest of the wine upon the garments of the guests, which they called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατασκεδάζειν</foreign>." Suidas. "The Scythians and Thracians, indulging in wine, both their wives and themselves, to excess, and pouring it over their garments, think that they observe an honourable and excellent custom." Plato de Legg. i.9. The middle voice, in this passage of Xenophon, signifies that the Thracians poured whatever remained in the cup, after they had drunk, not on the garments of their guests, but on their own. Kühner. This critic accordingly rejects the emendation of Pierson ad Moerin, p. 217, though approved by Toup and Porson: <foreign xml:lang="grc">συγκατεσκέδασε τω̃ν μετ' αὐτοῡ τὸ κέρας</foreign>, quod reliquum erat vini, in convivas effadit. But as Athenaeus iv. 35, Eustathius ad Hom. p. 707, Suidas sub voce <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατασκεδάζειν</foreign>, and Phavorinus, all read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετ' αὐτου̃</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετὰ τοῦτο</foreign>, he has admitted that reading into his text, thus making the sense of the passage, "Seuthes joined with Xenophon in sprinkling the wine on himself," i. e. Seuthes sprinkled wine from his own goblet on his own garments, and Xenophon, imitating him, sprinkled wine from his own goblet on his own garments. This is perhaps the best way in which the passage can be read and interpreted, if the verb be kept in the middle voice, which is in accordance with the passage just cited from Plato, though somewhat at variance with what is said by Suidas. But whether they sprinkled the wine over their own clothes or those of others, or both, we may dismiss the passage with Spelman's observation, that it was a "ridiculous custom." </note>

<title type="sub">A COMMENTARY ON THE ANABASIS OF XENOPHON.</title>
</ab>
<p>TilE zeal and critical acumen of scholars and travellers innumerable, have been devoted to the elucidation of the very remarkable journey of the Greeks under Cyrus, from Sardes, the capital of Lydia in Asia Minor, to Babylonia; and the still more extraordinary and interesting retreat along the river Tigris by Kurdistan and Armenia to the shores of the Black Sea.</p>
<p>The survey of the rivers Euphrates and Tigris by the expedition under Colonel Chesney, gave, however, opportunities for investigating this very interesting subject, such as had never previously presented themselves; and these opportunities may be said to have received their complement, by the advantages which were derived from a journey in Kurdistan and Armenia, performed in 1840, under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, by the writer, who, upon that occasion, followed the track of the gallant little corps, through the most intricate and difficult portions of their wander- <unclear/> ings. The result of these researches were first given to the public in a little book, published in 1844, entitled "Travels in the Track of the Ten Thousand Greeks."</p>
<p>Since that time, however, further elucidations have rapidly succeeded one another, by far the most important of which are contained in the great work by Colonel Chesney, " The Expedition for the Survey of the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris," of which the two first volumes only are yet published. These volumes, however, comprise all that refers to the expedition of Cyrus, and contain an immense mass of matter corroborative or corrective of what has been before published.</p>
<p>The brilliant discoveries of Layard in Assyria, and the not less valuable and important philological researches of Colonel Rawlinson, have also, during the lapse of the last ten years, brought a flood of light to bear upon the past history and

condition of tne populations that dwelt upon the banks of the Eu. phrates and the Tigris, which are not without their intimate bearings upon the narrative left to us by the Athenian historian and commander.</p>
<p>Several classical scholars have also contributed their share of new and valuable critical inquiries; among the most important of which is a correction made by Professor Maiden, and published in the Classical Museum, (No. vii. p. 36, et seq.,) of the generally accepted version of the passage which occurs in the Anabasis, (iv.6.
4,) and which has been hitherto read as, After this they marched seven days' marches, at the rate of five parasangs a day, to the river Phasis," but which, according to Professor Malden, must be read as along the river Phasis. There is no real ambiguity, Professor Malden avers, in the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρα</foreign> in such a context.</p>
<p>The effect which such a correction of seven marches has upon that portion of the Katabasis which refers to Armenia is considerable. The number of marches between the Euphrates and the Phasis or Araxes, is reduced to seven, or by one-half what was previously supposed, and this important correction proportionately affects the subsequent portion of the route.</p>
<p>The commentary or exposition now offered to the public is therefore just as much a commentary on the "Travels in tie Track of the Ten Thousand Greeks," as it is on those works which preceded it, and on those inquiries and speculations which have been entertained since. It is by no means, however, supposed to carry the subject out of the domain of further inquiry: milch remains to be done before all the questions connected with this most perplexing subject can receive a complete and satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>SARDES.—Leaving his relatives and friends in charge of the governments of Lydia, Phrygia, and Ionia, Cyrus is described as commencing his march from Sardes or Sardis in April, displaying, as Colonel Chesney remarks, admirable judgment in taking the more circuitous route along the great plains and through the principal cities of Asia Minor, in preference to that by which Xerxes advanced through Cappadocia ;since it gave him the support of his fleet, by which he could receive supplies and reinforcements from time to time, besides having a fair chance of concealing for a longer period his bold design.</p>
<p>The capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia was situated a the foot of Mount Tmolus, in a fine plain watered by the river Pactolus, of gold-bearing celebrity. It was once a great and flourishing city, and from its wealth and importance was the object of much cupidity and of many sieges. When taken by Cyrus the Great, under Croesus, its last king, who has become proverbial for his riches, Sardes was one of the most splendid and opulent cities of the East. After their victory over Antiochus it passed to the

<pb n="267"/>
Romans, under whom it rapidly declined in rank and importance. In the time of Tiberius it was destroyed by an earthquake, but was rebuilt by order of the emperor.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Sardes bore an ill repute among the ancients for their voluptuous habits of life. Hence, perhaps, the point of the phrase in the Apocalyptic message to the city,—" Thou hast a few names, even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments."
(Rev. iii.4.) The place that Sardes holds in this message, as one of the " seven churches of Asia," is the source of the peculiar interest with which the Christian reader regards it.</p>
<p>Successive sieges and earthquakes, and the ravages of Saracens and Turks, have reduced this once flourishing city to a heap of ruins, presenting, however, many remains of its former splendour. When visited by W. J. Hamilton in 1836, with the exception of a few black Yuruk tents, the only habitation was that of a Greek miller, who had taken advantage of one of the streams which flow past the Acropolis, to turn the wheel of his mill.</p>
<p>The principal ruin is that of the Acropolis, situated on the top of a crumbling hill. The ruin is, however, itself made up of ancient fragments, the walls and 'gateway of the fortress being, according to Hamilton, probably Byzantine, and there being no traces of walls of Hellenic construction. Two gigantic Ionic columns, with other huge fragments, mark the site of the temple of Cybele. There are also remains of a Roman theatre, but the marble seats, the proscenium, and scena, are all gone: also of a stadium, the northern side of which has been artificially formed by a wall supported on arches running along the side of the hill. There are also remains of two early Christian churches, one of which has been too hastily concluded by travellers to have been the church of Sardis to which allusion is made in the Apocalypse; but besides that tho expression can only have referred to the community of Christians then established, the nature of the structure shows that its date must have been at least posterior to the overthrow of the Pagan religion and the destruction of the temples towards the end of the fourth century. Many other remains are scattered over the area of the ancient town; amongst which the most remarkable is the so-called Gerusia, situated near the western limits of the city, partly built of brick and partly of stone, but of a late period; while to the west of these two walls are the massive marble fragments of another building, apparently of much older date.</p>
<p>A countless number of sepulchral hillocks beyond the Hermus, heighten the desolateness of a spot which the multitudes lying there once made busy by their living presence and pursuits..

<p>MAEANDER.—The direction of Cyrus' march appears to have been parallel to the Cogamus, and having made in three days twenty-two parasangs, he arrived at the river Maeander, which he passed on a bridge of seven boats, probably above the junction of the Lycus. The Maeander was celebrated in classic poetry for its tortuousness, whence our term—meandering. Ovid, in describing the Minotaur's labyrinth, compares it with the Maeander. As soft Macander's wanton current plays, When through the Phrygian fields it loosely strays; Backward and forward rolls the dimpled tide, Seeming at once two different ways to glide: While circling streams their former banks survey, And waters past succeeding waters see; Now floating to the sea with downward course, Now pointing upward to its ancient source. It may be remarked here, that considering the stadium and parasang as fragments of the earth's true meridional circumference, as more particularly developed by Colonel Jervis, the amount admitted in the Travels in the Track of the Ten Thousand Greeks, was G07.G2977 English feet for the first, 5468.668 English feet for the second.</p>
<p>The principle upon which this estimate is founded is this: that the Jewish itinerary measure was the Parsah of 3 Bereh; each Bereh of 7½ Khebel, or 3000 measures. The Parsah, corresponding to the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρασγγα</foreign>, or the Persian Farsakh, the Bereh to the Turkish Beré, and the Khebel, or rope, to the stadium. The Jewish Bereh was the 24,000th of the earth's true meridional circumference; the fundamental measure, therefore, the 72,000,000th of the meridional circumference, which Colonel Jervis having computed to the ellipticity from a comparative summary of the results of the Lapland, British, French, and Indian measurements, is <figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BELL_83_fig10.jpg"/></figure>or 21.8724876 inches English. Now the element is to the common element, of all those itinerary measures alluded to by Eratosthenes, Cleomedes, Posidonins, and othei historians and other writers, whether Egyptian, Jewish, Greek, Roman, or the earlier Arabian, as 5 to 9,—that is, they were, one and all, the 40,000,000th, the Jewish the 72,000,000th, of the earth's meridional circumference; and hence the true length of the Roman and Greek foot, and cubit, and stadium may be immediately inferred.</p>
<p>For the Jewish Parsah being the eight-thousandth part of the circumference, or 24,000 such measures above stated, was 5468.668 feet English. The Bereh, 1-24,000th of the meridional circumference, or 3000 such measures, was 5468.668 feet English. The Khebel, or stadium =729.15584 feet English (the side,-i. e. the

<pb n="269"/>
length and breadth, of the greatest pyramid, or that of Cheops). One-ninth of this was the Greek and Roman stadium, 607,62977 feet English; the 600th part, the true Greek foot, 12.156 English inches; the 6'25th part, the true Roman foot, 11.67 English inches. The Greek and Roman cubits respectively 18.2289 and 17.4997 English inches.</p>
<p>Colonel Jervis felt satisfied that these data would serve to clear up many difficulties in the writings of Herodotus, Xenophon, Strabo, Pliny, Diodorus, Curtius, and others, whose apparent discrepancies he believed to be due rather to our misapprehension, than to any obscurity or inaccuracy in those authors. For either we must suppose the earth to have altered in dimension, the situation of remarkable places to have changed, or the ancients to have been wholly devoid of intelligence; or we must resort to the conclusion that the misapprehension of these difficulties is rather to be sought for in our own want of patient consideration.</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney has proceeded upon a much more latitudinarian system. " The modern farsang or barsakh of Persia," he says in his great work, "The Expedition for the Survey of the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris," vol. ii. p. 207, "varies according to the nature of the ground, from three and a half to four English miles per hour; and being always calculated for mules, or good horses, under favourable circumstances, it frequently exceeds four miles. The ancient parasang appears to have been fixed at thirty stadia, which at 202.84 yards would give three geographical miles. But this being also a road measure, it no doubt varied as at present, and was regulated according to the nature of the country ; and fortunately we have the means of ascertaining this difference with considerable precision. A line drawn along the map so as to touch the river, at short distances, from Thapsacus to the river Araxes, is about one hundred and five miles, which for the fifty parasangs of Xenophon, give 2.10 geographical miles each. By the route followed from Sardis to Thapsacus, it is eight hundred and fiftythree geographical miles, which will give 2.608 geographical miles for each of the three hundred and twenty-seven parasangs. Again, from Thapsacus to the mounds of Muhammad, thirty-six miles from Babylon, where, for the sake of water, the route constantly follows and almost touches the river Euphrates, it is four hundred and twelve geographical miles, thus giving 1.98 geographical miles for each of the two hundred and eight parasangs, or 2.294 geographical miles for the mean of both."</p>
<p>" This scarcely differs from the result obtained by the laborious and discriminating geographer, Major Rennell, who, without our present advantages, estimated the parasang at 2.25 miles; which, in fact, approaches an average of the whole march of Cyrus. We find that the distance from Sardis to Cunaxa, or the mounds of Muhammad, cannot be much under or over 1265 geographical

<pb n="270"/>
miles, making 2.364 geographical miles for each of the five hundred and thirty-five parasangs given by Xenophon between those places."</p>
<p>"From the preceding calculations," continues Colonel Chesney, " it appears that we are warranted in taking the average value of the parasang at 2.608 geographical miles throughout the march to Thapsacus, and at 1.98, or almost two miles, from thence to Cunaxa; but subsequently it is less than two geographical miles. The greater speed in the first part of the march, was the natural consequence of moving during the most favourable season of the year, (April and May,) with the additional advantage of roads. The want of the latter must have been a serious impediment to the carriages during the next fortnight; for, although the marches were pressing, the heavy-armed men, with their weapons, would have been greatly retarded, by the almost insupportable heat of the summer months ; in the subsequent retreat, the mountains, the rivers, and unknown tracts, as well as the snow on the ground, must have caused still greater retardations." This is a view of the subject which I have also been obliged to adopt in the present commentary.</p>
<p>COLOSSAE.—Advancing from the Maeander through Phrygia, the army made in one day's march eight parasangs, to Colossae, described as being at that time a large city, rich and well inhabited. This city had indeed been previously noticed by Herodotus,
(vii. 30,) as a large city of Phrygia oil the Lycus, a tributary to the Maeander. Xerxes, on his march to Sardis, B. C. 481, reached Colossae after leaving Anaua. Colossae had become a place of comparatively little importance in Strabo's time.</p>
<p>A Christian church was formed here very early, probably by Epaphras, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, to whom Paul, who docs not appear to have ever visited Colossac in person, addressed an Epistle from Rome. Not long after, the town was, together with Laodicea and Hierapolis, destroyed by an earthquake. This, according to Eusebius, was in the ninth year of Nero; but the town must have been immediately rebuilt, for in his twelfth year it continued to be named as a flourishing place. In the middle ages there arose near it a town called Chonae, and Colossae disappeared. Chonae was the birth-place of Nicetas Choniates, one of the Byzantine historians.</p>
<p>Arundel (Asia Minor, vol. ii. p. 139, &amp;c.) supposed that the ruins at the modern Khonos, which corresponds to Chonac, were also the ruins of Colossac, but Hamilton (Res. &amp;c. i. 508) found extensive ruins of an ancient city about three miles north of Khonos, which appear from certain hydrographical peculiarities alluded to by Herodotus and Pliny, and verified by Hamilton, to be undoubtedly the site of Colossac.</p>
<p>CELAENAE.-From Colossac Cyrus made in three days' march

<pb n="271"/>
twenty parasangs, to Cclacnae, a city of Phrygia, large, rich, and well inhabited, and where was the fortified palace of Xerxes, the palace of Cyrus, the hunting park, and the cave of Marsyas. Herodotus speaks of Celaenae in describing the march of Xerxes to Sardes. He says (vii. 26) that the sources of the Maeander are here, and those of a stream not less than the Maeander: it is named Catarrhaetes, and rising in the Agora of Celaenae, flows into the Macander. The Cattarrhactes of Herodotus is clearly the Marsyas of Xenophon. Hamilton, who visited the source at a place called Deenair or Dinair, describes it as a considerable stream of water gushing out with great rapidity at the base of a rocky cliff. It appeared as if it had formerly risen in the centre of a great cavern, and that the surrounding rocks had fallen in from the cliffs above. In Livy's description (xxxviii. 13) the Maeander rises in the acropolis of Celaenae, and runs through the middle of the city; and the Marsyas, which rises not far from the sources of the Macander, joins the same river. Leake thinks that it clearly appears from Strabo that both the rivers (Marsyas and Macander) ran through Celaenae, and that they united in the suburb which afterwards became the new city Apameia. It did not appear to Hamilton that the cliff above the source of the Marsyas could be the acropolis of Celaenae, which Alexander considered to be impregnable, and came to terms with the inhabitants. He supposes that the acropolis may have been further to the N. E., a lofty hill about a mile from the ravine of the Marsyas.</p>
<p>The town of Apameia Cibotus, which was built by Antiochus Soter out of the ruins of Celaenae, was positively stated by Strabo to lie at the source of the Marsyas. Arundel was the first who clearly saw that Apameia must be at Dinair; and his conclusions were confirmed by a Latin inscription which he found recording the erection of a monument by the merchants residing there. Leake has also collected the ancient testimonies as to Apameia. Hamilton investigated the hydrographic and other features of the place most carefully, and obtained several Greek inscriptions from the same neighbourhood.</p>
<p>PELTAE—From Celaenae Cyrus made in two days' march ten parasangs, and arrived at Peltae, a city well inhabited. Peltac, or rather the Peltenus Campus, has been identified with the plain now called Baklan uvah, which is watered by the Macander. Hamilton (ii. 163) describes himself as much struck with its level extent, and capabilities for manoeuvring cavalry. It may be, he says, the plain on which Cyrus reviewed his troops, and celebrated martial games after leaving Apameia: * for although he was marching to the east, it appears that he did not proceed thither
<note type="footnote"> * At page 203, vol. ii. of his Researches, &amp;c., Mr. Hamilton says he is inclined to place Peltae either in the groat plain to the south of Ishakli, or <unclear/> it the foot of the mountainstwo miles on the road from Ishakli to Dinair. </note>

<pb n="272"/>
direct; as Xenophon says that he passed through Ceramorum Agora, a town on the frontiers of Mysia, twenty-two parasangs from Apameia, which must have been to the N. N. W.</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney (ii. 206) attributes these two retrograde marches to the necessity of rounding a difficult portion of the Taurus.</p>
<p>Hamilton met on this plain burial-grounds with large blocks of stone, and broken columns, on one of which he found a mutilated inscription ; but a whole month, he says, dedicated to the examination of the numerous villages and burial-grounds which fill this extensive plain, and which increase in number as you advance eastwards, would not be too much to determine the name and sites of the ancient towns which once flourished here.</p>
<p>CERAMON OR CERAMORUM AGORA.—After halting three days to celebrate the Lupercalian sacrifice, Cyrus advanced twelve parasangs to Ccramon Agora, (the market of the Cramians,) the site of which, according to the back distances from Koniyah, would be a little east of the actual town of Ushak, but allowing for variation in the value of the parasang, at Ushak itself.</p>
<p>Pliny having noticed a town called Carinae in Phrygia, Cramer conjectured that this might be the Ceramon Agora. It has also been supposed to be the same as the Caris or Carides of Stephanus, but that name corresponds to the Carina of Pliny, or Caria, as it perhaps should be read.</p>
<p>Hamilton (ii. 204) describes Ushak as a place of considerable commerce and traffic in the present day; many of the high roads of Asia Minor passing through it. He also adds, that to a person going to Mysia from Apameia, (Celaenae,) and supposing, as Strabo says, that Mysia extended to Ghiadiz, (Kadi,) Ushak would be the last town through which he would pass before entering Mysia, from which it is separated by a mountainous and uninhabited district.</p>
<p>PLAIN OF CAYSTRUS.—From the market of the Cramians, Cyrus made in three days<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign> march 30 parasangs, and arrived at a well-peopled city, called the Plain of Caystrus. (Caystri Campus.)</p>
<p>It has been previously observed, that the site of the market of the Cramians has been determined by back distances, owing to the difficulty entailed by Cyrus having deviated from his course at Celaenae. Thus the march from Celaenae to Peltae is 10 parasangs; from Peltae to Ccramon Agora 12 parasangs; and from Ceramon Agora to the Plain of Caystrus, was 30 parasangs. From the Plain of Caystrus, Cyrus marched 10 parasangs to Thymbrium, then tO to Tyraeum, and then 20 to Iconium, the last city in Phrygia in the direction of his march; for after leaving Iconium, he entered Cappadocia. Iconium is Koniyah, a position well known. Celaenae may also be considered as a well-determined position. Now the march of Cyrus from Celaenae to Iconium was
92 parasangs. The angle thus obtained drives the site of the

<pb n="273"/>
market of the Cramians more or less to the N. W. of Ushak, according to the estimate taken of the parasang, 2.6 geog. miles according to Chesney, 2.455 geog. miles according to Hamilton, or 3 according to Colonel Jervis, but I have with others adopted the site of Ushak, as the most likely.</p>
<p>This question has been made the subject of some critical remarks by Mr. Long in the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, which I willingly give insertion to here.</p>
<p>" Two recent attempts,” Mr. Long writes, " have been made to fix the places between Celaenae and Iconium, one by Mr. Hamilton,(Researches,
&amp;c., vol. ii. p. 198,) and another by Mr. Ainsworth
(Travels in the Track of the Ten Thousand, &amp;c., p. 24). The examination of these two explanations cannot be made here for want of space. But it is impossible to identify with certainty positions on a line of road where distances only are given, and we find no corresponding names to guide us. Mr. Hamilton supposes that the Caystri Campus may be near the village of Chai Kieui, ' and near the banks of the Eber Ghieulin the extensive plain between that village and Polybotum.' Chai Kieui is in about 38° 40' N. lat."</p>
<p>"Mr. Ainsworth places the Caystri Campus farther west, at a place called Surmeneh, ‘a high and arid upland, as its ancient name designates,' which is traversed by an insignificant tributary to the Eber Göl,’ Mr. Hamilton's Eber Ghieul. The neighbourhood of Surmeneh, abounds in ancient remains ; but Chai Kieui is an insignificant place, without ruins."</p>
<p>"Both Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ainsworth, however, agree in fixing the Caystri Campus in the basin of this river, the Eber Ghieul, and so far the conclusion may be accepted as probable. But the exact site of the place cannot be determined without further evidence. Cyrus stayed at Caystri Campus five days, and he certainly would not stay with his troops five days in a high and arid upland. As the plain was called the Plain of Cayster, we may assume that there was a river Cayster, where Cyrus halted. One of Mr. Ainsworth'a objections to Mr. Hamilton's conclusion is altogether unfounded. He says that the plain which Mr. Hamilton chooses as the site of the Caystri Campus is 'an extensive plain, but very marshy, being in one part occupied by a perpetual and large lake, called Eber GoI, and most unlikely at any season of the year to present the arid and burnt appearance which could have led the Greeks to call it Caustron or Caystrus, the burnt or barren plain.' But the word Caystrus could not mean burnt, and Stephanus is guilty of originating this mistake. It means no male a burnt plain here than it does when applied to the plain above Ephesus. Both were watery places ; one we know to be so, and the other we may with great probability conclude to be."</p>
<p>As it appears that I was misled in the reading of Cayster, I do not wish to insist upon this special identification in the “ Track of
<note type="footnote"> VOL. 1. </note>

<note type="footnote"> or </note>

<pb n="274"/>
the Ten Thousand Greeks." I may however be permitted to observe, that the identification was not solely founded upon the circumstance of Surmanah being a dry upland. It was also founded on back distances from Iconium 20 parasangs to Tyriaeum, 10 to Thymbrium, and tO to the plain of Caystrus, or 120 geographical miles. Eber Göl, or Ibar Gül, being at a less distance. There is a stream of water at Surmanah as well as at Chai Kiui, and Xenophon tells us there was also in Cyrus's time a well-peopled city. So that it was not because it was an arid plain that it can be also shown not to have been a fit place for a delay of five days. I may also add that so marshy is the plain of Bulavadin, that the road from the N. W. to that town has to be carried in great part over a raised causeway. Hamilton (ii. 177) describes Surmanah as “a rich mine of antiquarian treasures," as is also the case with Afyum Kara Hissar in the same neighbourhood, which he looks upon as the site of ancient Synnada. The same observing traveller however makes mention of no ruins at or near Chai Kiui, which he also identifies with the Holmi of Strabo.</p>
<p>THYMBRIUM.—During a halt of five days on the plain of Caystrus, Cyrus received Epyaxa, the queen of Cilicia ; whose mysterioils visit and opportune supply of treasure enabled him to appease the Greeks by giving them three months’ arrears of pity. Accompanied by Epyaxa, he advanced thence, ten parasangs, to Thymbrium, on the borders of Lycaonia.</p>
<p>Estimating the parasang at three geographical miles, I have identified Thymbrium with the modern Ishakli, reckoning back from leonium. Even at the reduced estimate of Hamilton, ten parasangs, equal upon his scale to 24 or 25 geographic miles, measured from the site of Ilghun, or from the hot baths, brings us beyond Philomelium at Ak-Shahir, and nearly half way between that town and the fountain of Ulu Bunar Darbund. Hamilton describes that fountain as only four or five miles from Ak-Shahir, whereas I was upwards of two hours travelling from the one to the other. Colonet Chesney (ii. 208) places Thymbrium " at or a little south-eastward of the present town of Ak-Shahir,”</p>
<p>The expression used by Xenophon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνταυ̃θα ην παρὰ τὴν ὁδὸν</foreign>, would certainly appear to denote that he passed the fountain of Midas on the road to Thymbrium, although Spelman translates it " Here was a fountain near the road, called the fountain of Midas." "There seems, therefore,” says Hamilton, (ii. 202,) “every reason for placing Thymbrium at the foot of Sultan Tagh, between the fountain of Midas and Ak Shehr (Shahir), if indeed it be not an an older name for Philomelium itself." There certainly seems, however, taking the reduced estimate of the value of the parasang adopted by Hamilton and Colonel Chesney, still to remain more reasons for approximating the site of Thymbrium to the fountain of Midas than to Ak-Shahir, only that towns have mostly

<pb n="275"/>
succeeded to one another at the same site. The road, it is to be remarked upon this assumption of the value of the parasang, presents few difficulties, and it improves still more on approaching Iconium. I can understand the parasang covering little plane surface in the passes of Kurdistan or the snows of Armenia, but I cannot help feeling, with Colonel Jervis, that to suppose a varying estimate of that value on the plains of Asia Minor, argues a great want of intelligence on the part of the ancients, and reduces them to the semi-barbarous position of the modern Turk and Persian, who, reckoning by time and not by distance, leave it impossible, without actual investigation, to determine from such data the geographical position of places. It is obvious, therefore, in the instances of Peltae, Ceramon Agora, Caystri Campus, Thymbrium, and Tyriaeum, where we have only distances to go upon, we must remain more or less in a state of uncertainty as to their true posié tions. The fountain of Midas helps to throw some additional light upon the positioning of Thymbrium, that of Tyriaeum is confirmed by Strabo, and Ushak, as representing the market of the Cramians, remains to the present day a place of considerable traffic and commerce, and a place of meeting of high roads. These circumstances must be taken into consideration in determining the position of the sites noticed by Xenophon between Celacnae and Iconium, two known positions.</p>
<p>TYRIAEUM.—Cyrus made in two days' march ten parasangs, and arrived at Tyriaeum, a populous town. Hamilton and Colonel Chesney, upon the evaluation of distances before alluded to, think that Tyriaeum is probably represented by Ilghun. I sought for the site at Arkut Khan, but without wishing to put much stress upon so indefinite a point. Neither Hamilton nor myself saw any remains of ancient times at either Arkut Khan or Ilghun. There is this to be said of Ilghun, that there is beyond that town a plain much better adapted for the review of the Greek and Barbarian forces described by Xenophon, than at Arkut Khan, where the surface of the soil is broken up by slabs of horizontal limestone. Hamilton also remarks that their identification is confirmed by Strabo's account of the great road from Ephesus to Mazaca ; for he clearly places Tyriaeum between Philomelium and Laodicea, and near the borders of Lycaonia. Another argument in favour of this site is, that Strabo states that Holmi was at the commencement of Phrygia Paroreius, which would therefore be at the western extremity of Sultan Tagh, and he gives the distance from Holmi to Tyriaeum as rather more than 500 stadia. Now the distance from the commencement of the Sultan Tagh to Ilghun is
55 miles, and from Chai Kiui, which Hamilton identifies with Holmi, just about 50 miles, or 500 stadia.</p>
<p>ICONIOM.—From Tyriacum Cyrus made in three days march twenty parasangs, and came to Iconium, the last city of Phrygia.
<note type="footnote"> T 2 </note>

<pb n="276"/>
This, as one of the most ancient and remarkable cities of Asia Minor, requires little notice at our hands. Pliny calls it urbs celeberrima Iconium. Strabo speaks of it as small but well built.</p>
<p>When visited by the apostle Paul in A. D. 45, it is described as inhabited by a great multitude of Jews and Greeks. (Acts xiv.1.) The most remarkable era in the history of Iconium is that of the Seljukian Turks or Tartars, a branch of whom founded a dynasty at Koniyah in Karaman, before the rise of the Osmanli Turks.</p>
<p>Modern Koniyah is still a large town, the seat of a pasha, and of a Greek metropolitan, and it contains many interesting relies of olden times. Among the most remarkable of which is the mosque built by Sultan Aladin, the mausoleum of Hazrit Mavlana, the founder of the Mavlani darvishes or dervishes, the old Turkish prison, and the Injami Minareh Jami, "the mosque with the minarets towering to the stars."</p>
<p>LYCAONIA.—From Iconium, Cyrus made in five days' march thirty parasangs through Lycaonia, which being an enemy's country, he gave the Greeks leave to plunder it. From hence he sent the Cilician queen into Cilicia the shortest way. Now as the next place reached by Cyrus—Dana—is a well-known site, we have only to mark off thirty parasangs from Iconium and twentylive to Dana on the map, and the point of intersection will be the spot where Cyrus parted with the queen of Cilicia.</p>
<p>This spot may therefore, if Cyrus kept a northern road, have been at or near the now small town of Kara Bunar, “ the Black Spring;” or if gallantry led him to take a southerly route, the parting may have taken place at or near Tchurla or Churla, north of Karaman, near which Hamilton found many ruins of ancient sites, notoriously those of Lystra and Derbe, whither Paul and Barnahas fled after their expulsion from Iconium. I am most inclined to the latter view of the case.</p>
<p>From this point Epyaxa returned to her husband Syennesis, the king of Cilicia, across the Taurus by Kizil Chasmah, Alan Buzuk, Mazatli, Soli or Pompeiopolis, and onward to Tarsus.</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney remarks upon this incident in the march of Cyrus, that it may be inferred from what subsequently passed in Cilicia, that the object of this remarkable mission and the timely supply of treasure, was to induce Cyrus to take another route, that Syennesis might not be embroiled with Artaxerxes, by permitting the march through his territory; and it is not improbable that, from her peculiar intimacy with the prince, the queen believed she had been successful. Cyrus, however, availed himself of her return, to send a body of Greeks under Menon, nominally as a guard of honour, but in reality to turn the Cilician Gates, the only pass which was practicable for an army through this part of Taurus. Two companies, amounting to one hundred heavy-armed men, were lost in this undertaking, and the rest, arriving before the

main body of the army, and resenting the loss of their companions plundered both the city of Tarsus and the palace that stood there</p>
<p>DANA.—Cyrus, with the rest of his army, moved on through Cappadocia, and, in four days' march, made five and twenty parasangs to Dana, a large and rich city, well inhabited.</p>
<p>Tyana was well known to all antiquity, not only as the residence of Apollonius and the site of a temple of the Asbamaean Zeus, but also as the town nearest to the Cilician Gates. Strabo says it was also called Eusebia ad Taurum, and that it was built on a mound raised by Semiramis, or called Semiramis, probably a heap of Assyrian ruins. Cellarius argued that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δανα</foreign> was a contraction made by the copyists for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τύανα</foreign>, and the correction thus made has been strengthened by subsequent inquiry.</p>
<p>Thus Hamilton was enabled to identify the ruins at the site now called Kiz Hissar, "Girls Castle," or Kilis Hissar, “ Castle of the Church," with Tyana, by the existence there of a small lake or pool which presents the peculiar phenomenon ascribed to the fountain of Asmabaeus sacred to Zeus by Ammianus Marcellinus, of never overflowing its banks, and of bubbling up like a boiling cauldron as described by Philostratus. (Res. ii.303.) An identification which is further confirmed by the mound on which the ruins stand.</p>
<p>The site of Tyana being then determined, the distance from Iconium, the situation of the town at the entrance of the pass of Taurus, and its olden celebrity, point it out as the Dana of Xenophon, or as Cellarius more probably opines, that Dana was a miscript for Tyana.</p>
<p>CILlClAN GATES.—Cyrus is described as preparing at Dana to penetrate into Cilicia ; the entrance was broad enough for a chariot to pass, very steep, and inaccessible to an army if there had been any opposition; and Syennesis was said to have possessed himself of the eminences, in order to guard the pass; for which reason, Cyrus stayed one day in the plain. The day after, news was brought by a messenger that Syennesis had quitted the eminences, upon information that both Menon's army were in Cilicia, within the mountains, and also that Tamos was sailing round from Ionia to Cilicia with the galleys that belonged to the Lacedaemonians and to Cyrus, who immediately marched up to the mountains without opposition, and made himself master of the tents, in which the Cilicians lay to oppose his passage.</p>
<p>The Cilician Gates, called by the Turks in the present day, Kulak Bughaz, constitute perhaps one of the most remarkable and picturesque mountain-passes in the world. Colonel Chesney adds to this, (ii. 210,) that it is one of the longest and most diflicult passes in the world.</p>
<p>The road through the pass ascends more or less across a wild country from Harakli to Kulu Kushla, a distance of about 28

<pb n="278"/>
miles, and up to which point the rivulets are tributary to the Ak Güli, or white lakes, the outlet of which may be justly suspected to be a subterranean channel, having a cavernous exit towards the plain of Adana.</p>
<p>Beyond Kulu Kushla, or “ place of winds," the road descends by a narrow glen into the valley of a tributary to the Sihun or Sarus. This valley is wooded, and bordered by precipitous clifls. At a place called Shiftla Khan, some nine or ten miles beyond Kulu Kushla, two valleys meet to form a third, which is an open, wooded, pleasant vale, that leads through the very heart of the Bulghar Tagh.</p>
<p>The road leaves this picturesque valley at a distance of eight or nine miles, to ascend in a south-westerly direction, an open valley bearing a small tributary to the Sihun, which is left behind flowing to the south-east, till an upland is reached, where the celebrated defences of the Egyptians were situated. Immediately beyond this, a rivulet, flowing in a southerly direction, leads to a pass in the mountains so narrow as to be just broad enough, as Xenophon describes it, for a chariot to pass—if disencumbered of fallen rocks. This pass is the true Kulak Bughaz; high precipitous cliffs tower up on both sides; on the summit of one of which are the remains of a castle with round towers, and a tablet, which once bore an inscription, is still to be seen on the face of a large mass of detached rock that lies in the rivulet. Beyond this, two roads lead, one over hills by Mizarluk, “ the place of graves," chiefly sepulchral grottoes, to Tarsus; the other along open winding wooded vales, and at first rocky, then low rounded undulating hills, to the great plain of Adana, which is but slightly elevated above the level of the waters of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>PLAINS OF CILICIA.—Cyrus is described by his historian as descending from the mountains into a large and beautiful plain, well watered, and full of all sorts of trees and vines; abounding in sesame, panic, millet, wheat, and barley.</p>
<p>The plain of Adana, as it is now called, is still remarkable for its beauty and fertility. Portions, especially in the upper parts and around Anazarba, are merely meadow land, or covered with greensward, with, in the least watered portions, a good deal of mimosa, and here and there a lonely dark-leaved carob-tree, a great feature in the scenery. But a considerable portion of the plain is cultivated, furnishing sesame, panic, millet, wheat, and barley, as in olden time, as also rice, cotton, and sugar-cane, since introduced. Near Tarsus, or the valley of the Cydnus, there is a good deal of wood, and at Adana a few date-trees speak volumes of a change of climate. The flocks of small bustards and the numerous gazelles impart another peculiar feature to the plain, as do also its rocky castle-bearing knolls in another direction.</p>
<p>This plain is described by Xenophon as surrounded by a strong

<pb n="279"/>
and high ridge of hills. It is, indeed, as well as the Bay of Issus, or Gulf of Alexandretta, perfectly enclosed by Taurus to the west and north, Amanus to the east, and Rhosus to the south.</p>
<p>TARSUS.—Cyrus having left the mountains, he advanced through the plain, and having made five and twenty parasangs in four days' march, arrived at Tarsus, a large and rich city of Cilicia, where stood the palace of Syennesis, king of Cilicia; having the river Cydnus running through the middle of it, which river is two hundred feet in breadth.</p>
<p>Tarsus is a city of such great antiquity that its origin is involved in fable. While Scripture historians affirm that the sons of Tarshish, the great-grandson of Noah, settled on this coast, classic mythology insists that Tarsus was built by Perseus son of Zeus by Danae. Hypacheans, according to Herodotus; a colony of Argives, according to others; it is certain that it was a city favoured by the Assyrians.</p>
<p>Grotefend states that after Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, had reigned twenty-five years, he extended his conquests over Asia Minor, and took up his abode in the city of Tanakan, a strong place in Etlak, by which, perhaps, Tarsus in Cilicia is meant, of the building of which by Sennacherib a fabulous account is given by Alexander Polyhistor and Abydenus in the Armenian version of Eusebius. After he had introduced into that place the worship of Astarte or Nisroch, and received tribute, he reduced the neighbouring provinces to subjection, and appointed Akharrizadon, or Assarhaddon, as king over them. This is one of the triumphs supposed to be alluded to in the celebrated obelisk of Nimrud or Athur. No traces exist of the statue described by Arrian as commemorating the building of this city and Anchiale by Sardanapalus in one day.</p>
<p>No contribution to the history of Tarsus has been so rich in resuits as the publication of the 11 Lares and Penates” of Cilicia from terra cottas discovered on the spot by Mr. William Burckhardt Barker. We have among these, evidences of Assyrian mythology, in the presence of the Assyrian Perseus, Sandon or Hercules,
(Dayyad the Hunter, and the same as Nimrod,) the Assyrian Bellerophon and Pegasus, and horses of the sun. We have evidences of Egyptian mythology in representations of Isis, Osiris, Horus, Anubis, and Phre the Hawk-the Egyptian sun. With these we have, as might be anticipated, a whole host of illustrations of the mythology of Syria and Phoenicia, of Lesser Asia, Greece, and Rome. Tarsus was a well-known and distinguished seat of Greek philosophy and literature, and from the number of its schools and learned men, was ranked by the side of Athens and Alexandria.
(Strabo, xiv. pp. 673, 674.)</p>
<p>To the Christian, Tarsus derives its greatest Interest from being the birth-place of the apostle Paul. Augustus made Tarsus free

<pb n="280"/>
This seems to have implied the privilege of being governed by its own laws and magistrates, with freedom from tribute, but did not confer the jus coloniarum, nor the jus civitatis: and it was not therefore, as usually supposed, on this account that Paul enjoyed the privilege of Roman citizenship. Tarsus, indeed, eventually did become a Roman colony, which gave to the inhabitants this privilege; but this was not till long after the time of Paul. We thus find that the Roman tribune at Jerusalem ordered Paul to be scourged, though he knew he was a native of Tarsus, but desisted on learning that he was a Roman citizen. (Acts ix. It ; xxi. 39; xxii. 24, 27.)</p>
<p>In the time of Abulfeda, that is, towards the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century, Tarsus was still large and surrounded by a double wall, and it was chiefly inhabited by Armenian Christians.</p>
<p>Tarsus has always been a city of considerable commercial importance. Albertus Aquensis speaks of three thousand ships sailing from the port of Tarsus, and even in the present day a much greater extent might be given to the commerce and the mercantile and agricultural resources of the place.</p>
<p>CYDNUS.—The river Cydnus which flows through Tarsus, doriving its waters from the snows of Taurus at no very great distance from the city itself, are extremely cold, and bear an evil repute since the days of Alexander the Great. Malaria prevails however to a great extent in the city, quite independent of any more immediate contact with its waters.</p>
<p>CASTLE OF NIMRUD.— Tarsus is described by Xenophon as abandoned by its inhabitants, who, with Syennesis, fled to a fastness upon the mountains, those only excepted who kept the publichouses. The fastness here alluded to has been identified with the castle of Nimrud in the adjacent mountains, partly on account of its antiquity, partly because no other likely place is known. The castle of Nimrud has not however been visited by any competent traveller.</p>
<p>SOLL.—The inhabitants of Soli and Issus, who lived near the sea, did not quit their habitations. Issus will be noticed in due course. Soli was a colony, according to Pomponius Mela and others, founded by the Argives and Rhodians; but according to Diogenes Laertius, by Solon, who founded there a colony of Athenians, who gradually corrupting their own language, gave origin to the term Soloecism.</p>
<p>This city was afterwards put under contribution by Alexander and devastated by Tigranes, and Pompey confined to the same locality the pirates who troubled the neighbouring seas, and gave the place his own name—Pompeiopolis.</p>
<p>The ruins of the ancient city still exist near a place now called Aski Shahir, "the old city," near Mazatli on the coast. They

<pb n="281"/>
have been minutely described by Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort in his Karamania (pp. 246—259, et scq.). Many additions have been made to these descriptions in Mr. W. B. Barker's work before alluded to,“ Lares and Penates : or, Cilicia and its Gorernors”
(p. 130 et seq.). A plan and description of the ruins by Captain Prissick are also to be found, in Dr. Holt Yates' “Modern History and Condition of Egypt."</p>
<p>RIVER PSARUS.—Cyrus is described as making from Tarsus, in two days' march, ten parasangs to the river Psarus, which therefore corresponds to the river of Adana, now called Sihun, or Saihun, to distinguish it from its neighbour the Pyramus, called Jihun, or Jaihun, just as the Oxus or Amu of the Turks and Tartars is called Jihun to distinguish it from the Jaxartes, Sir Darah, or head valley, of the Turks, the Sihun of the Arabs. Jihun is the Arabic corruption for the Hebrew Gihon, the name of one of the rivers of Paradise.</p>
<p>This river is, by my own admeasurements, three hundred and twenty-five feet wide at Adana. My idea of the distance by road from Tarsus to Adana corresponds more closely to the evaluation of 3 geographical miles to the parasang than of 2½ miles. Colonel Chesney (ii. 210) himself says it is rather more than twenty-nine miles between the two places.</p>
<p>RIVER PYRAMUS.—From the Psarus, Cyrus made, in one day's march, five parasangs to the river Pyramus, which was a stadium in width. The distance here between two well-established points is also at the rate of 3 geographical miles to the parasang. From whatever point the Greeks crossed the Sihun there would be 15 geographical miles of nearly level plain to reach the Jihun or Jaihun, as the Pyramus is now called.</p>
<p>“ The width given by Xenophon," says “ Colonel Chesney, indicates that the passage of the Psarus was effected somewhere about the place now occupied by the city of Adana, and that of the Pyramus in the vicinity of the present town of Mallus or Misis; and neither of the rivers being fordable, it may be presumed that they were, as in the case of the Maeander, crossed on some kind of temporary bridge."</p>
<p>Issi, or ISSUS.—From the river Pyramus Cyrus advanced in two days' march, a distance of fifteen parasangs, to Issi, the last city in Cilicia, situate upon the sea-coast, a populous, large, and rich place.</p>
<p>We are here placed in the dilemma of diminishing the value of the parasang, over a country presenting no particular difficulties, or of supposing, as I have done in the “ Travels in the Track," &amp;c., that Cyrus forded the river in its lower parts, and at a time when its embouchure was at Kara Tash. This would have taken them across the plain of Ayas, ancient Campus Alieus, by which Philotas,

<pb n="282"/>
as recorded by Arrian, led the horse, on the occasion of the advance of the Macedonians under Alexander the Great, and which would give forty-five miles between the Pyramus and Issus, whilst from Misis there is only thirty-three or thirty-four miles. I do not wish however to lay particular stress upon this view of the case, especially since all other commentators now agree in varying the value of the parasang according to the nature of the ground, and there are on the road from Misis to Issus two ranges of hills to cross. The first the Jibal an Nur, or mountain of light, presents a little pass that would present obstacles to chariots; the second also presents a narrow pass, where is the ancient Cyclopean arch, called the Iron gate, or the Black gate, and which corresponds to the Amanian gates with a station, (the latter represented by the ruins at Matakh,) and a further detour is occasioned by the marshes at the end of the plain, on which are situated the ruins of Epiphanea, originally called Oeniandos and Castabala. These two sites are determined from the distances given in the Antonine Itinerary, and the Theodosian Tables. The latter place, Epiphanea, 30 M. P. from Anazarbas, and the same distance from Alexandria ad Issuni, now Iskandarun or Alexandretta.</p>
<p>The positioning of Issus gave much more trouble, and involved the careful discussion of the historians of Alexander as compared with Cicero and other accessible authorities. All the circumstances of the case pointed however tolerably satisfactorily to a great extent of ruins scattered over the plain, north of the Dalichai, or mad river, as the Pinarus is now called. The only point not satisfactorily cleared up was the position of the altars of Alexander. It has been suggested that these may be the ruin called Jonas' Pillars, a point which Alexander had reached before he heard that Darius had crossed the Amanus in his rear, and from whence he returned to engage in the battle of Issus, so fatal to the Persian hosts. Quintus Curtius said that these altars were erected on the banks of the Pinarus, but Pliny describes the Domitae or altars as between Amanus and Rhosus, which would point to the locality here suggested. Another difficulty remains with regard to Nikopolis, which Stephanus says was a name given to Issus after the great battle fought there by the Macedonians, but Strabo and Ptolemy both agree in making it a different place.</p>
<p>GATES OF CILICIA AND SYRIA.—From Issus Cyrus proceeded one day's march, five parasangs, to the Gates of Cilicia and Syria. "These were two fortresses; of the part within them, towards Cilicia, Syennesis and a guard of Cilicians had the charge ; the part without, towards Syria, a garrison of the king's soldiers was reported to occupy. Between the two runs a river called Carsus, a plethrum in breadth. The whole space between the fortresses was three stadia; and it was impossible to pass it by force; for the

<pb n="283"/>
passage was very narrow, the walls reached down to the sea, and above were inaccessible rocks. At each of the fortresses were gates."</p>
<p>Dr. Anthon says the common text has <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κέρσος</foreign>, but the reading of the best MSS. is <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καρσος</foreign>. The Rev. J. T. Macmichael has adopted the correction of Psarus for Pharus, but not that of Karsus for Kersus. There is every reason to believe that this river, now called Markaz su, corresponds to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κέρσίας</foreign> of Ptolemy, and the Crocodilon flumen of Pliny. It was at the foot of that part of Amanus called Mons Crocodilns. The French annotators of Pliny have suggested an identity between a Syriac word analogous to Kersus, and the Egyptian Kamses, a crocodile, hence Kersus or Karsus would be the same as the Crocodilon flumen.</p>
<p>The Gates of Cilicia and Syria occur at a point where the Amanus approaches most closely to the sea-shore. Coming from the north, we have the Markaz su, or Karsus, which flows from a gap in the rocks, between high perpendicular precipices, past the modern village of Markaz, and then divides into two branches, one of which goes nearly directly to the sea; the other, after losing itself in a marshy lagune, finds its exit into the sea at a distance of about a mile and a half north of the direct branch. This first or northerly stream is passed by a bridge, and a little distance farther south are ruins on the shore of the termination of a wall with a gate. At a distance of about six hundred yards, corresponding to the three stadia of Xenophon, are the more perfect ruins of a wall, which can be traced amid a dense shrubbery, from the mountains down to the sea-shore, where it terminates in a round tower.</p>
<p>A little beyond to the right, and on the slope of the hills, is a Saracenic castle, noticed under the same name of Markaz in the Mecca Itinerary, published by the Geographical Society of Paris. From this castle the rocks advance directly to the shore, leaving a narrow pass over which a paved road is now carried, and upon which stands the ruined gateway called Jonas' Pillars, or Sakal Tutan, “ Beard-catcher," an Oriental expression for a difficult pass.</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney remarks that “ the Markaz or Mer<foreign xml:lang="grc">κ</foreign>ez su, ancient Karsus, determines the sites of the so-called gates or fortresses, which were erected to defend the ground; the one being in Cilicia, and the other in Syria, the river flowing between them."</p>
<p>When we consider the important events of which these gates were the scene, in the time of Cyrus the younger, as also in that of Alexander the Great; the mystical name of the river, which associates it with ancient crocodile worship, and the Axio-Kersian or Samo-Thracian mysteries, and the ruined edifice corresponding to the Bomitae of Pliny, all domineered over by the castle of Saracenic times, it would be difficult to imagine a more interesting mass of ruins, both in a classical and archoeological point of view,

<pb n="284"/>
grouped together in so small a compass. Nor is the scene so replete with historical associations wanting in picturesque accessories.</p>

<p>MYRIANDRUS.—Cyrus is described as proceeding from the Gates of Cilicia and Syria, through Syria, one day's march, five parasangs, to Myriandrus, a city near the sea, inhabited by Phoenicians: this place was a public mart, and many merchant-vessels lay at anchor there.</p>
<p>The site of Myriandrus has not yet been satisfactorily determined. According to the distances given by Xenophon of five parasangs from the Gates of Cilicia and Syria, it would be, if on the sea-shore, either some way beyond Alexandretta on the way to Arsus, or if the sea, as was probably the case, extended further inland at that time, and occupied the now pestilent marshes of Alexandretta, beyond Godefroy de Bouillon's Castle; at the foot of the hills near Jacob or Joseph's well, where Rennell sought for the site in question, or a little beyond that, and nearer to the foot of the pass of Baylan. It is evident that Myriandrus and the town subsequently named after the Macedonian hero, were not the same, for Strabo mentions both, and in the following succession: Rhosus (Arsus), Myriandrus, and Alexandria. The ruins may perchance yet be found in the wooded country that lies between Alexandretta and Rhosus, at or near the coast, about opposite the entrance of the pass of Baylan. This is a region which has not yet been satisfactorily explored.</p>
<p>RIVER CHALUS.—Cyrus proceeded four days'march, a distance of twenty parasangs, to the river Chalus, which was a plethrum in breadth, and full of large tame fish, which the Syrians looked upon as gods, and allowed no one to hurt either them or the pigeons.</p>
<p>This is a long journey, of from 50 to 60 miles, in which several objects of interest are passed over without an observation. Among the first of these is the pass between Amanus and Rhosus, the true Syrian Gates, in which are situated vestiges of the strong town called Pinara by Pliny and Ptolemy, and by corruption Erana by Cicero, who describes it as being in the mountain above the region in which the altars of Alexander were situated-another proof that the “ Bomitae” were at the foot of Amanus and Rhosus, and not, as Quintus Curtius relates, on the banks of the Pinarus.</p>
<p>Pinara was the Pictanus of the Jerusalem Itinerary, and it is now represented by the town of Baylan, whose mosque was built, according to the Mecca Itinerary, by Sultan Selim, and the Khan by Sultan Sulaiman the Magnificent. There are also remains of a causeway, of an aqueduct, and of a bridge.</p>
<p>Beyond the Syrian Gates was Pagras or Pangrios, represented apparently by the castle of Ibn Abu Daud; and at the foot of the mountains, the great plain watered bv three different rivers. the</p>

<pb n="285"/>

<p>Karasu, the Aswad, and the Afrin, corresponding to the Labotas, the Aenoporas, and Arceuthus of the Romans, and in the centre of which is the great expanse of the lake of Antioch.</p>
<p>The silence of Xenophon with regard to this mountain-pass, the rivers and lake of the plain of Antioch, and the rocky region beyond, now called St. Simon or Shaikh Barakat, has given origin to various surmises on the part of commentators on the Anabasis. Rennell has supposed, in consequence of this silence and that of Straho, that the lake did not exist at that time; and Forster, in his Geographical Dissertation, has made this one of the grounds for supposing that Xenophon kept no journal, or at least no regular one, of the expedition, but that he drew it up a great many years afterwards. I think it more likely, from the general character of the work, that something occurred, sickness or despondency, and the latter might naturally have been brought about by the clandestine departure of Xenias and Pasion, to distract the attention of our historian or to make him disinclined to write. Contrast, for example, the indifference of the present moment, with the energy displayed and the minuteness of description indulged in when Xenophon became a leader in the passes of Kurdistan.</p>
<p>A tributary to the river Sajur having been found during the survey of northern Syria by the Euphrates Expedition, to still preserve the name of Baluk or Baluklu su, "Fish River," Colonel Chesney makes Cyrus march in a north-easterly direction, over a very difficult country, to that insignificant rivulet, to turn almost back again in a direction south, a little west, to the Chalib or Kuwait—the river of Aleppo, at the point where a large group of tells,. or mounds of ruin, give evidence of the existence of a once prosperous and flourishing community,</p>
<p>I do not, however, see any reason for changing the opinion I had adopted in common with other geographers, that the Chalib or Kuwait represents the Chains of Xenophon. The direct distance is perhaps not sufficient, but the difficulties of the road presented by the pass of Baylan, the marshy plain of Antioch, and the necessity of turning northwards up the valley of the Afrin, to avoid the rocky deserts of Shaikh Barakat, give in detail a distance between the Mediterranean and the river Chalib of at least sixty geographical miles, or of three miles to a parasang.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding a statement of Rauwolf's, that fish were scarce in the market of Aleppo, I stated as the results of my own observation in the Travels in the Track, &amp;c., that the Chalib abounded in fish, and I have since found in Dr. Russell's Natural History of Aleppo, 1794, vol. ii. p. 207, that not only do fish abound in the Chalib, but that there is a fountain called Haïlan, a Syriac word signifying.“ the powerful," (see my Travels and Researches in
<note type="footnote"> * Tel or Tell of the Arabians, Tuppah, vulgo Teppeh, of the Turks, Thupo in Pali, Stupa in Sanscrit, vulgo Topes in India. </note>

<pb n="286"/>
Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, &amp;c. vol. ii. p. 101,) where, as in the fountain of Birkat a! Ibrahim or Abraham, the beloved, at Urfah, of Mambij ancient Hierapolis, at the tomb of Daniyali Akbar, " the greater Daniel," (see Rawlinson in Journal Roy. Geo. Soc. vol. ix. p. 83,) and elsewhere, fish are still, or were till lately, preserved unmolested, and therefore more or less reverenced or sacred in the eyes of the true believers.</p>
<p>Dr. Russell says, "From what I had cursorily remarked in the markets, or at the tables of the inhabitants, and from the appearance of the Kowick (Kuwait), I hardly expected to find so great a variety of fish in that river; but, upon examination, it was found to produce seventeen species, and amongst those, some hitherto undeseribed.”</p>
<p>"To the assiduity of the fishermen, which is restrained to no particular season, and exercised with little discretion, may be partly ascribed the small size of the fish in general; for at Heylan
(Hailan), and the fountain of fishes, where they are suffered to remain unmolested, they grow considerably larger."</p>
<p>It is almost needless to remark, that this superstitious reverence for fish is a remnant of the Assyrian and Syro-Arabian worship of fish gods. Berosus (see Cory's Ancient Fragments, p. 22 and 31) makes Oannes the first and Odakon the last of these. Selden (De Diis Syris, p. 2G5) is persuaded that this Odakon is the Philistine god Dagon. The further resemblance between Dagon and Atergatis or Derketo is so great in other respects, that the same authority accounts for the only important difference between them— that of sex—by referring to the androgynous nature of many heathen gods. The Greeks embodied their worship, as usual, into their mythology, by a poetic story of the loves of the goddess Derketa or Derceta.</p>
<p>RIVER DARADAX, or DARDES.—From the villages of Parysatis on the Chalus, Cyrus advanced, five days' march, a distance of thirty parasangs, to the sources of the river Dardes, which is a plethrum in breadth. Here was the palace of Bclesys, the governor of Syria, and a very large and beautiful garden, containing all that the seasons produce.</p>
<p>The common text has <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δαραδακος</foreign>, but Anthon * gives <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δάρδητος</foreign> with Dindorf, on good MS. authority. Colonel Chesney's view of this portion of the progress is, " In advancing first in an easterly direction along the Baluk-su, then southward by the banks of the same stream, and again eastward, quitting the latter when opposite

<pb n="287"/>
to the fountain of Bab, near the source of the stream called Dhahab or Dabb, it is about sixty-one miles to the last, the presumed Daradax: and if the windings of the Koweik (Kuwait) be followed in the earlier part of the march, it would be seventy or eighty miles from the higher part of the Chalib or Chains, which, as in the time of Xenophon, still abounds in fish. The distance (thirty parasangs) given by Xenophon between the rivers Chains and Daradax, which was accomplished in five marches, agrees with the nature of the intervening country; for whether the windings of the upper part of the Koweik were followed, or the stream forded two or three times in preference, a fifth march would be requisite, as already mentioned." (ii. p. 213.)</p>
<p>Some difficulties present themselves in accepting this determination. In the first place, the distance given would accord better with the idea of Cyrus having crossed the Syrian plains from the Chalus to the Euphrates, notwithstanding Xenophon's silence upon the subject. The same silence, or rather passing over all notice of the river Euphrates until the army came to Thapsaeusis observed throughout, and may have been an inadvertence, for the nature of the country would oblige an army to keep along the banks of the river; and Colonel Chesney, who identifies the fountain of Dhahab with that of Dardes, still makes Cyrus, notwithstanding the silence of Xenophon upon the subject, join the Euphrates at Balls.</p>
<p>The name of the site—Balis—corresponding to the Barbalissus or Barbarissus of the Romans, and the ruins existing there, would point to that place as the site of the palace of the Persian satrap. Then again, at that point there is a great alluvial plain, which to the present day abounds in boars and other game, while all beyond, or westward, is a dry arid upland, a perfect wilderness, which, however, may be modified somewhat by the waters of the Dhabab.</p>
<p>Lastly, there was a canal, taken from the Euphrates at Balis, which might be a hundred feet wide at its origin, as described by Xenophon, and which it is difficult to imagine the fountain of Fay, as Rennell calls it—al Bab, or Taidiff—could present at its origin.</p>
<p>There is to be added to all this, that the back distance from Thapsacus (Al Hammam) to Balis corresponds precisely with the distance given by Xenophon between the palace of Belesis and Thapsacus, that is, fifteen parasangs or forty-five miles by the bends of the river. Notwithstanding the points in favour of one and the other view of the subject, common sense would point to a probable visit to the fountain of Dhahab, or Dardes, on the way to the palace of Belesis at Balis. <unclear/> But so common sense would also point to the identity of Bayas, or Baiae, with Issus, where is a river to represent the Pinarus, a plain large enough to fight a battle, without being cut up by deep ruts like the plain of Dali-ehai, and where the ships could be moored opposite Cyrus' tent, a

proceeding scarcely possible at the mouths of the Dali-chai, only that other circumstances do not uphold this hypothesis.</p>
<p>THAPSACUS.—Having wantonly destroyed the palace and park of Belesis, Cyrus is described by Xenophon as proceeding, in three days' march, a distance of fifteen parasangs, to the river Euphrates, which is there four stadia in breadth, and on which was situated a large and rich city, named Thapsacus. Colonel Chesney
(ii. 213) describes these as “ pressing marches, following and constantly touching the Euphrates from Balis," which accords with the view previously taken of this portion of the march.</p>
<p>The distance here given of forty-five miles, corresponds with the overland distance from Balis to the ford celebrated among the Arabs, as that of the Anazah or Badawin. This ford, as such or as a bridge, was used for the passage alike of Persian, Greek, and Roman armies, and more lately of Arabs, Tartars, and Turks. Xerxes, who, according to Herodotus, crossed the Hellespont by a bridge of boats, in which one was tied to the other, had constructed a similar one at Thapsacus, but this was destroyed by Abrocomas on the approach of Cyrus. Alexander dragged over the boats necessary for the passage of the river from the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The remains of a paved causeway are still to be observed on both banks of the river, which is here eight hundred yards, or four stadia, in width. This causeway is marked in the Augustan and Theodosian Tables as part of a road carried by Palmyra to Ba. bylonia, as also northwards to Carrhae, Edessa, and to more remote countries.</p>
<p>A congregation of mounds, well worthy of archoeological exploration, are all that remain of the ancient Tiphsah, which was taken possession of by Solomon, probably in connexion with the series of operations (of which the building or fortification of Tadmor was one) adopted by him for the purpose of drawing the Eastern trade into his own dominions. Tiphsah became afterwards Thapsacus, both signifying the same thing, “the ford." The same place is called Sura by Pliny and by Ptolemy, and this was its name in medieval times, for it is called in the Ecclesiastical notices of the Lower Empire, Flavia firma Sum. It was also, according to Stephanus, called Turmeda by the Syrians, and Amphipolis under the successors of Alexander. The ruins are now called Suriyah.</p>

<p>Rennet and D’Anville were induced from the supposed existence of a ford or pass of the Euphrates at Dair, “ the monastery," and in ignorance of the existence of this ford, to identify Thapsacus with that little Arabic town, which is built upon a vast mound of ruin-the remains of some site of antiquity. But it is two hundred and eleven miles by the river from Balis to Dair, and to get over this difficulty, these two distinguished geographers were

<pb n="289"/>
obliged to suppose that Xenophon had, by an oversight, misplaced the distances of Belesis to Thapsacus, (fifteen parasangs,) and from Thapsacus to the Araxes—Xenophon’s name for the Khabur — (fifteen parasangs,) and that it should have been fifty parasangs from Balis to Thapsacus, and fifteen from Thapsacus to the Araxes. It is satisfactory to find by the true determination of the position of Thapsacus at fifteen parasangs from Balis, that there is no necessity whatsoever for this violation of the accuracy of the historian.</p>
<p>RIVER ARAXES.—Cyrus having with his army forded the Euphrates at Thapsacus, the waters rising no higher than the breast; he is described by Xenophon as advancing through Syria, nine days’ march, a distance of fifty parasangs. to the river Araxes, where were a number of villages, stored with corn and wine.</p>
<p>Having crossed the Euphrates, it is manifest that the country the army was marching in was in reality Mesopotamia, but it was by no means an uncommon thing for the Romans to describe the districts in question sometimes as in Syria, at others in Mesopotamia. Pliny and Strabo both speak of the country lying between Thapsaeus and the Seenite or nomade Arabs, as Syria.</p>
<p>Wherefore Xenophon called the river Khabur, Araxes, it is difficult to determine. The name was by no means an uncommon one, and Strabo, in accordance with the national custom of referring foreign names to a Greek origin, connects the word with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀράσσω</foreign>, and adds that the Peneus was once called Araxes, on account of its having separated Ossa from Olympus at the gorge of Tempe.*</p>
<p>This river was, however, known to antiquity generally by other names, approaching more or less to its present appellation. Thus, it is described in the Old Testament (2 Kings xxiv. 15; Ezek. i. l,
3; iii. 15, 23; x. 15, 20) under the name of Chebar, as a river of Mesopotamia, upon the banks of which Nebuchadnezzar planted a colony of Jews, among whom was the prophet Ezekiel.
<note type="footnote"> * Rawlinson has shown the prefix Ar, Ara, and Arta, to be of transcendental use in every single branch of Arian Paleography, with the exception of the Zend. (Journ. of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. x. p. 55, and vol. xi. p.
33, ct seq.) Ar, or liar, he says, significs mountain, as in Arburz, (El Burz,) Arakadrish, (Aracadres,) Ar Parsin, the mountains of Persia. Bochart long ago showed (I'haleg i. I) that the first syllable in Armenia (Armina in the cuncifonn) signified in Semitic “a mountain." Burnouf and Lassen have traced Arius (Ariya of the cuneiform) to the root signifying “ man." We have another form in Arabia, the cuneiform Arabaya. Arta, so much used as aprefix to names, as in Artakhshatra, (Artaxerxes,) signifies, according to Rawlinson, aking.There can be little doubt then of the native origin of the name Aras, the Araxes of the Greeks, although there might be some doubt if it meant mountain river, or a head or chief river ; assuming the prefix Ar to have somewhat the same power as Syr, Sir, or Sar, used by the Turks in Syr Damah, (Jaxartes,) as head valley or river; and by the Kurds, as head mountain or stream indifferently. Araxes has been generally supposed to be a Greek modification of the Armenian Arasch or Eraschs. </note>

Layard says that in the Hebrew text the name is spelt in two different ways. In Kings we have Khabour. In Ezekiel it is written Kebar. So also in the Septuagint it is written <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χοβάρ</foreign>. It is called Aboras and Abboras by Strabo, Zosimus, Ammianus, Procopius, and others. Ptolemy writes it Khaboras.</p>
<p>Layard, whilst carrying on his archaeological explorations in Assyria, having been informed by the Arabs that two colossal idols, similar to those at Nimrud, had been laid bare by the waters of the Khabur; he repaired to the spot, and was rewarded by the discovery of a considerable number of monuments of Assyrian times, of which he says, "the Archaic character of the treatment and design, the peculiar form of the features, the rude though forcible delineation of the muscles, and the simplicity of the details, certainly convey the impression of greater antiquity than any monuments hitherto discovered in Assyria Proper."</p>
<p>The Khabur is a large river having its sources in the Karajah Tagh in northern Mesopotamia, and receiving in its course downwards tributaries from Kuhrasar (Sinna) and Has al Ain (Resaina) from the west; from Masku, Mardin, Dara, Nisibin, (ancient Mygdonius,) Asnawur, and Cliil Agha from the east, besides a rivulet called Al Hauli or Holi from the marshes of Khatuniyah in the Sinjar. The main branch of the river is by accident omitted in the map accompanying Layard's account of his discoveries in Nineveh and Babylon. (1853.)</p>
<p>At the junction of the Khabur and he Euphrates, we have on the north the ruins of Carchemish of Scripture, called by the Greeks Kirkesion, and by the Romans, with whom it was long a frontier town, Cerensinm. The place is called by the Arabs in the presen: day Kirkisiyah, and also from the abundance of ruins, Abu Sarai,“ the father of palaces." Layard, who did not visit it, says " Abou Psera.” Al Wakidi, in his History of the Conquest of Mesopotamia by the Arabs, ealls it Karkisha.</p>
<p>To the south are the mounds of Kalneh, supposed by Colonel Chesney (i. 52; 117, 118) to be the site of Calneh, or Chalneh, the fourth of Nimrod’s cities. (Gen. x.10.)</p>
<p>According to the Chaldee version, with which Eusebius and Jerome agree, this is the same place that was subsequently called Ctesiphon.</p>
<p>Colonel Rawlinson has however, by the aid of those important paleographic researches which promise to throw an entirely new light on Assyro-Babylonian and Chaldean history and geography, discovered the ideograph for Calneh among the inscribed bricks of a place called Niffer. (Ann. Report of the Royal Asiatic Society vol. xv. p. xix.) He had previously (Jour, of Roy. Asiat. Soc. vo.. x. p. 22) identified, as he also said from the evidence of the bricks, the same primeval site with the Chaldean ruins of Kalwadha near Baghdad.</p>

<pb n="291"/>

<p>ARABIA.—Cyrus advanced from the Khabur through Arabia, naving the Euphrates on his right, five days' march through the desert, a distance of five parasangs.</p>
<p>Rawlinson remarks that in the cuneiform inscriptions the name of Arabia (Arabaya) is sometimes introduced between those of Babylon and Assyria, sometimes between Assyria and Egypt; and he adds, “ I think, therefore, we may suppose the title to apply to the Mesopotamian Desert, and the basin of the Euphrates, which have always been inhabited by Arab tribes, rather than to the vast Southern Peninsula. The Jews, in the same way, whose geographical notions were very limited, designated as Arabia, or the country of the Arabs, the region immediately joining Palestine, and stretching southwards to the Red Sea." (Journ. of Roy. Asiatic Society, vol. xi. p. 38.)</p>
<p>Thus it was that, in accordance with the views entertained at that epoch, we find Xenophon describing those regions of Mesopotamia which lie north-westward of the Khabur, as Syria; and those to the south, as Arabia. The Athenian historian's description of the desert is so concise, and so graphic, as to be familiar to everyone, and, as a consequent penalty, has been often quoted as descriplive of regions which have little in common with the particular territory in question.</p>
<p>RIVER MASCAS AND CITY OF CORSOTE.—Marching through this region, Xenophon relates, they came to the river Mascas, the breadth of which is a plethrum. Here was a large deserted city, of which the name was Corsote, and which was entirely surrounded by the Mascas.</p>
<p>At a distance of sixty-three miles touching the river curves, or of one hundred miles and upwards by the river's winding, a considerable tract of alluvium is cut off from the main-land, by a canal, which drawn from the river at a northerly point, empties itself by three different embouchures to the south. Beyond are cliffs of marls and gypsum, upon which traces of ruins of older time are still to be met. The place is called in the present day Irzah or Izrah, and also by corruption Werdi.</p>
<p>It is not at all improbable from this site being nearly opposite to Al Kayim, the Agamana of Ptolemy, where the great desert route from Palestine to Babylon first touches the Euphrates, that this was one of the cities of bondage, where the captive Israelites awaited the coming of Ezra, with the glad message that was to enable them to return to their own country. In this case the Masca would correspond to the Ahava of Scripture.</p>
<p>The ruins of Corsote of Xenophon would appear to have been on the plain, being described as entirely surrounded by the Mascas, unless we are to understand, as is more probable, that this description allides to the great bend of the river at this point, and which is described by Balbi, who descended the Euphrates in
<note type="footnote"><unclear/> 2 </note>

<pb n="292"/>

1579, as keeping them from morning to noon in sight of the ruins. When Balbi, however, speaks of these ruins as of greater extent than the city of Cairo, and presenting nothing to view but portions of massy walls and lofty towers, we must conclude that he mistook the cliffs and great broken masses of gypsum for fragments of ruin. Rauwolf, who travelled in 1574, also described the peninsula as occupying more than half a day to encompass it.</p>
<p>GATES OF BABYLONIA.—From Corsote Cyrus proceeded, thirteen days' march, through the desert, a distance of ninety parabangs, still keeping the Euphrates on the right, and arrived at a place called the Gates.</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney is inclined to think, that as it appears by the subsequent movements, that the “Gates” were about twenty-four miles short of the Median Wall, the past, in question may safely be placed about twenty-seven miles below Hit, or nearly opposite to the village of Jarrah, from which, by the map, there are about one hundred and seventy-five or one hundred and seventy-seven geographical miles to represent the ninety parasangs from Corsote to the Pylae, which at 1.98 each, give 178.2 geographical miles.
(ii.214.)</p>
<p>The banks of the Euphrates in this part of the route, and more particularly in the lower portion, are exceedingly rocky and irregular, till we arrive at the level alluvial plains of Babylonia. It is difficult among these irregular hills to distinguish one place as more worthy of being designated as a pass than the other, and I had hence been induced by that circumstance, and by a consideration of the distance travelled, (and which, by supposing the troops to have been compelled to keep to the banks of the river, I had given a much greater length to than Colonel Chesney,) to identify the Pylae with the pass or descent from the hills upon the plain of Babylonia itself.</p>
<p>Rennell, it is to be observed, coincides in this view of the subject, as he conjectures that the term pylae refers to the shutting up of the river itself between the mountains, which terminate at the same place on both sides of the river. This termination of the hilly country at the level alluvial plain of Babylonia constitutes indeed a very remarkable feature in the physical aspect of these regions.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. F. Maemichael,in his edition of Xenophon, (Appendix, p. 336,) suggests the conclusion that Pylae was neither city
(as Larcher surmised) nor mountain defile, but the ancient pass into Babylonia through the Median Wall, at a time when it extended—as when entire it must have done—to the Euphrates. There is a great deal of plausibility in this suggestion.</p>
<p>CHARMANDE.— On this long march through the desert, the troops are described as passing over on rafts of skins to an opulent and extensive city, called Cliarmande. As no distances are given,

<pb n="293"/>
I was inclined to identify this site with the most important position on the right bank of the Euphrates, that occurs within the interval between Corsote and the “ Gates," viz. the city of Iz or Izanesopolis, whose bitumen fountains were visited by Alexander, by Trajan, by Severus, and by Julian; but Colonel Chesney (ii. 214) is more inclined to seek for the site at some ruins, which occur on the right bank opposite to the island of Jibbah or Jubbah. This is evidently, at the present moment, a position that is not satisfactorily determined.</p>
<p>FIELD OF REVIEW IN BABYLONIA.—Cyrus is described as proceeding through Babylonia, three days' march, a distance of twelve parasangs; and at the end of the third day's march, he reviewed his army, both Greeks and Barbarians, in the plain, about midnight; for he expected that with the ensuing dawn the king would come up with his army to offer him battle.</p>
<p>The spot at which this review took place would, allowing 3 geo. miles to the parasang, be 36 miles beyond the Pylae, 32 miles south of the Wall of Media, 36 miles north of Cunaxa, and 72 miles north of Babylon. If we allow only 2.5 geo. miles, or place the Pylae north of the plain of Babylonia, the distances will be proportionately diminished. We have, however, a means of determining the positioning of the army of Cyrus on the plain of Babylonia a little more accurately, from the events recorded in the next day's march.</p>
<p>TRENCH OF ARTAXERXES.—Cyrus proceeded from the field of review on the plain of Babylonia, one day's march, a distance of three parasangs, with all his forces, as well Greek as Barbarian, drawn up in order of battle; for he expected that on this day the king would give him battle; as about the middle of the day's march, there was a deep trench dug; the breadth of it was five fathoms, and the width three. This ditch extended up through the plain, to the distance of twelve parasangs, as far as the Wall of Media. Here are the canals which are supplied from the river Tigris; there are four of them, each a plethrum in breadth, and very deep; boats employed in conveying corn sail along them. They discharge themselves into the Euphrates, are distant from each other one parasang, and there are bridges over them. Near the Euphrates was a narrow passage between the river and the trench, about twenty feet in breadth. This trench the Great King had made to serve as a defence, when he heard that Cyrus was marching against him. By this passage Cyrus and his army made their way, and got within the trench.</p>
<p>If the trench or ditch, here spoken of, had been a canal drawn diagonally from the river Tigris, such a canal 36 geo. miles in length, starting from the N. E. or Tigris end of the Median Wall, would just touch on the maps attached to the Expedition for the Survey of the Euphrates and Tigris, the Nahr Isa or Saklawiya

<pb n="294"/>
canal at or about the ruins of Sifairah, ancient Sippara. But there seems no reason to suppose that it was a canal. Xenophon appears to distinguish this trench or ditch from the four canals derived from the river Tigris which he describes in the same paragraph. This, however, may be open to doubt. In such a situation a trench or ditch mignt naturally be supposed to be full of water. But whichever may be the case, it is not said that it was drawn from the Tigris, but merely that it extended upwards to the Median Wall. Now a distance of 36 geo. miles laid down on the Expedition map from a central portion of the Median Wall, would carry the trench to the Abu Gharib country, somewhere about where the Nahr Malka or Malik has its origin. This would place the field of review in the same region, some seven or eight miles to the northward, and would lead us to suppose, as would be most naturally the case, that the four canals were drawn from the great overflow of the Tigris near Accad, called Al Hur, and from the Tigris itself between that and Al Ghirarah, in the very line in fact of Colonel Chesney's proposed line of communication. All the commentators on Xenophon have found great difficulty in admitting the historian's accuracy in this point, because he differs from other authorities, as Herodotus, Diodorus, Arrian, Pliny, and Ammianus, in making the canals flow from the Tigris; all others describing them as flowing from the Euphrates. But this difficulty loses its force, when we consider that the alluvial plain between the two rivers is so level that it merely requires to alter the diagonal direction of a canal to determine which way its waters shall flow, and thus the marsh of Al Hur is flooded at one season by the Tigris, at another by the Euphrates through the Isa canal. Thus also the Isa, Nahr Malik and other canals flow from the Euphrates to the Tigris, while the Shat al Hai flows from tke Tigris to the Euphrates. It is probable that, at the time of Artaxerxes, the usual canals may have also flowed from Euphrates to Tigris, and that the four canals of Xenophon described as only 2½ or 3 miles from one another, were exceptions to the Nile, and drawn from the marsh of Accad and the Tigris, above the canals of Babylon itself, which may have flowed from the Euphrates to the Tigris.</p>
<p>BATTLE-FIELD OF CUNAXA.—As the king made no attempt at the trench to prevent the passage of Cyrus's army, it was thought both by Cyrus and the rest that he had given up the intention of fighting; so that on the day following Cyrus proceeded on his march with less caution. This was still more the case on the next day's march ; when news came that the Great King was approaching, and the battle so fatal to Cyrus took place.</p>
<p>We have here an account of short desultory and irregular marches, which would have brought the allies, according to Colonel Chesney, to at or near the mounds of Muhammad, 34 or 36 miles along the river from the Median Wall; but, according to my

<pb n="295"/>
former estimate of the value of the parasang, nearer to the site of Imsayab or Mussayib about 15 miles direct, but upwards of
20 by the bends of the river north of Babylon. It is evident that Cyrus deemed himself very near to Babylon, since he had almost given up any thoughts of resistance on the part of Artaxerxes.</p>

<p>Xenophon describes the battle fully, but does not mention the name of the place where it was fought. Plutarch, in his Life of Artaxerxes, has alone preserved it, and states that it was 500 stadia from Babylon. This would make it fifty miles north of Babylon. Xenophon, however, says that the distance from the field of battle to Babylon was only 360 stadia, or 36 miles, a distance which would tally best with that of the before-mentioned mounds of Muhammad.</p>
<p>MOUND, ON PLAIN OF BABYLONIA.—The night of the battle, the Greeks pursued the Persians as far as a certain village, where they hailed; for above the village was a hill, upon which the king's troops had checked their flight. The hill here alluded to appears to have been one of the numerous artificial mounds, topes, or tells, sometimes sepulchrai sometimes heaps of ruin, which abound on the plain of Babylonia. The word used to designate the hill is sufficiently descriptive, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γηλοφος</foreign>, a compound of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γη</foreign>, earth, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοφοι</foreign>, hill, mound, or tumulus, “ a heap of earth."</p>
<p>It is the more important to establish this fact, as there are no natural hills on the plain of Babylonia; and therefore the mention made by Xenophon of a hill at this place, has led the distinguished traveller, Baillie Fraser, to consider it as furnishing evidence of the battle having been fought to the north of the Median Wall.</p>
<p>BABYLONIAN VILLAGES.—As soon as a retreat had been decided upon between the Greeks and the Barbarians, and the line of route to be followed determined by Ariaeus, they started on a long day's journey to certain villages, the position of which would be in a great measure determined by a more satisfactory conclusion as to the site of Cunaxa. Colonel Chesney places these villages on the Abu Gharib or Nahr Sarsar of Abulfeda, near the extensive mounds and ruins of Kusli or Sindiyah.</p>
<p>The direction of the next march is not given, but it is stated that the army met with ditches and canals, so full of water, that they could not cross without bridges; but they made crossings of the palm-trees which had fallen, and others which they cut down. There is every reason to believe from this statement that the Greeks were led into the interior of Babylonia, and Clearchus appears justly to have suspected that the ditches had been filled with water purposely, as it was not the season for irrigating the land. At last they arrived at some villages, where was plenty of corn, hnd wine made from dates, and where it would appear they remained twenty-three or twenty-four days.</p>

<pb n="296"/>

<p>WAI.L OF MEDIA.—At length, after marching three days, they arrived at the Wall of Media, as it is called, and passed to the other side of it. This wall was built of burnt bricks, laid in bitumen; it was twenty feet in thickness, and a hundred in height, and the length of it was said to be twenty parasangs; and it was not far distant from Babylon.</p>
<p>“ Not the least remarkable of the discoveries," says the Rev. J. F. Macmichael in the Appendix to his Xenophon," which of late years have marked the progress of geographical inquiry in this most interesting—but, till of late, unexplored—region, is the actual existence at the present time of an ancient wall stretching across Mesopotamia at the head of the Babylonian plain. Mr. Ross, who first examined it at its eastern terminus, in 1836, describes it under the name of Khalu or Sidd Nimrud, (wall or embankment of Nimrod.) and as a straight wall 25 long paces thick, and from 35 to 40 feet high, running S. W. J N. as far as the eye could reach, to two mounds called Ramelah, (Sifairah, Ainsw. p. 81-2,) on the Euphrates, some hours above Felujah.—The eastern extremity was built of the small pebbles of the country, cemented with lime of great tenacity; and farther inland, his Bedwin guides told him it was built of brick, and in some places worn down level with the desert,—and was built by Nimrod to keep off the people of Nineveh, with whom he had an implacable feud. (Journal of It. Geog. S. ix. p. 446.) It was further examined by Captain Lynch, and its eastern extremity determined to be in lat. 34° 3'30", and long. 21' 50" W. of Baghdad. (Ibid. p. 472.)</p>
<p>" The identity of this wall with Xenophon's Wall of Media was assumed by the explorers tacitly, but with strong ground of probability. Of the great antiquity of the Sidd Nimrud there can be no question; record of its origin there is none, except local tradition assigning it to Nimrod. On the other hand, the continued existence of a wall (corresponding to the Median) from Xenophon’s age down to comparatively recent times, is attested by a chain of scattered notices in later writers. Such a wall is mentioned by Eratosthenes, (in the third century B. C., quoted by Strabo ii. l, and xi. 14,) as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ τὴς Σεμιράμιδος διατειχισμα</foreign>, having its eastern terminus at or near Opis. Again, its western terminus was noticed (in a state of ruin) by Amm. Marcellinus (363 A. <unclear>D</unclear>.) at Macepracta on the Euphrates, near the head of a canal, which he distinguishes from the Naha Malcha, (Nahr Malik,) doubtless the Saklawiyeh, a few miles north of which is the S. W. extremity of the Sidd Nimrud."</p>
<p>.. Their identity is further attested by their occupying the same general position as a partition-line between the rocky desert of Arabia and the fertile alluvial plain of Babylonia :the Sidd Nimrud, for all practical purposes, distinguishes the Babylonian plain from the hilly and rocky country. (Ainsw. p. 82, note 2.)—And

<pb n="297"/>
that a like position must be assigned to the Median Wall is strongly indicated by the name it bears, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μηδιας τεἵχος</foreign>. For the Medes under Cyaxares had conquered all Assyria up to Babylonia, a tract which, in Herodotus, includes the entire canal distinct, (i.
193,) and in Xenophon commences where the desert of Arabia terminates—at or near a place called Pylae, (i.5.5,) where, accordingly, we should look for the western terminus of the Median Wall.”</p>
<p>From a consideration of the different circumstances detailed by Xenophon of the first retrograde steps taken after the battle of Cunaxa, I was induced to believe that Tissaphernes, having arrived with his army and the guides, marched, as Xenophon expresses it, as if he designed to return home; that he led the Greeks three days' march, or about thirty-six miles, towards Sifairah, at which point he turned round, and conducted them through the Wall into Sitacene, thus leaving them in perplexity with regard to the relations of that rich and fertile province to the city of Babylon.
(Trav. in the Track, &amp;c., p. 108-9.)</p>
<p>The following is the account given by Colonel Chesney of this the first portion of the Katabasis, and which is so difficult to understand.“In taking a northerly direction from the presumed position of the camp, it would be necessary to cross the Nalir Malka; and on account of this obstruction, as well as the presence of an enemy, the distance made would scarcely exceed ten miles. Fatigued by the march, and without sustenance, a slight circumstance was sufficient to cause a tumult, and almost a panic, among the Greeks. The panic was, however, speedily calmed by the ingenuity of Clearchus, and at day-break he marched with the intention of becoming the assailant. This bold manoeuvre led to a negotiation with the king on equal terms, and guides were in consequence appointed to conduct the Greeks across the Nahr Sersar, and its affluents, which intersect this part of the country. These cuts appear to have been filled with water, but the difficulties were overcome by cutting down the palm-trees to make bridges, in which operation Clearchus set the example; and the army reached the intended halting-place in some villages probably not more than ten miles from the preceding station. These were abundantly provided with corn, vinegar, and wine made from dates After spending about twenty-three days in negotiations, having made engagements to be faithfully conducted homeward, and obtained supplies, the Greeks, the troops of Ariacus, and those of the king under Tissaphernes, commenced what seemed a peaceable march, although certain circumstances attending it gave rise to suspicion, and some precautions were adopted in consequence by the Greeks. In three days, probably, taking, as in the preceding march, a westerly direction, in order to round the marshes and inundations near Akar Kuf, the armies came up to and de

<pb n="298"/>
parted from the Median Wall into the interior. This wall, whose remains are described in Xenophon, was of bricks, and once 100 feet high and 20 feet thick : it is still to be traced, with its towers and ditch, running south-westward from the Tigris, nearly opposite Kadisiyeh, to the Euphrates, near Felujah, a distance of fortytwo or forty-three miles."</p>
<p>This view of the subject is illustrated by the following note. "The translation of this passage of Xenophon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφικοντο πρὸς τὀ
Μηδιας τεῑχος, καὶ παρη̃λθον αυτου εισω</foreign>, (Anabasis, lib. ii. cap. iv.,) has been much discussed and variously rendered. In Allpress's Xenophon. p. 80, the army is made to arrive at, and pass along within, the Median Wall; which translation is also given in the Anabasis of Xenophon, by Charles Anthon, L.L. D. William Tegg and Co. Cheapside (By passing within this wall, Dr. Anthon does not appear to understand keeping to the south side of it, but passing through it, for he says in a note, (p. 157 of the 1st edition,) Ainsworth thinks that this going throughtheMedian Wall, &amp;c. W. F.A.); by the Rev. Dr. Butcher, Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin; as well as by Schneider, who, in a note on this passage, condemns Halbkardt for translating it, 'Kamen sie zur Medischen Mauer, nnd setzen nu<foreign xml:lang="grc">̆</foreign>n jenseit derselben ihren Marsch fort.'"</p>
<p>Viger, in his Greek Idioms, also quotes an instance from Xenophon, where the verb occurring in the passage in question joined with a substantive in the genitive case, signifies “departure from" or deflection; and Donnegan’s Greek Lexicon gives <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴσω</foreign> as an adverb, with the signification of “ in the interior," “ inside," or within, which renderings of the passage are in conformity with the relative geographical positions of the Median Wall and Sitace, On the other hand, Hutchinson, in his edition of Xenophon, p. 139,
(Hutchinson’s translation is “ intr<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀ</foreign>que eum ingressi sunt,” p. 145, Oxford edition, 1745. W.F.A.,) and Mitford, History of Greece, vol. iv. p. IS!:!, state that the Greeks came up to and passed through the Median Wall; and this interpretation has been followed by Bishop Thirlwall, in his History of Greece, vol. iv. p. 335, cd. London,
18-17, since he conceives, in accordance with Passow, in his Greek Lexicon, that when joined with a verb of motion, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴσω</foreign> must bear the signification of to the inside, not on the inside. The bishop of St. David's considers that Schneider's condemnation of Halbkardt arises solely from the great difficulty of reconciling his translation with the geographical position of Sitace, but that the philo. logical difficulty thus raised by Schneider, is quite as great as the geographical difficulty of the ether. The same opinion appears to be held by other Greek scholars; the Right Rev. Dr. Wilson, Lord Bishop of Cork and Cloyne, and the Rev. Dr. Mac-Donnell, Senior Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, among the number.”

Macmichael, Head-master of the Grammar School, Burton on Trent, who says, “ We gather from the narrative, that they commenced the retreat (after joining Ariaeus) in a northerly direction, (ii.2.8,) and continued it with Tissaphernes—who was journeying homewards
(<foreign xml:lang="grc">ώς εις οικον ἀπιών</foreign>, iv. 8)—far enough in this direction to pass out of Babylonia ; for on the sixth day of the retreat, they passed within the Median Wall (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρη̃λθον εἵσω αὐτοῡ</foreign>, iv. 12)—an expression which can only signify an entry through it into Babylonia.
(Cf. 1. iv. 4, 5—vii. 16.) The line of route suggested by Mr. Ainsworth, viz. back by Pylae, and then for some distance on the, N. side of the Wall, is apparently the only one consistent with the data, geographical and historical, of the problem,” P. 339.</p>
<p>Apart, however, from the respect due to Colonel Cliesney's views of the matter—it remains quite an open question, whether a northwesterly route, to avoid the Hur or marshes of Akka Knf, would not have taken the Greeks to a position so near to the Median Wall as to be described by them as within that wall, before they turned to the eastward towards Sitaee,</p>
<p>SITACE.—From the Wall of Media they proceeded, in two days' march, the distance of eight parasangs; crossing two canals, the one by a permanent bridge, the other by a temporary one, formed of seven boats. These canals were supplied from the river Tigris ; and from one to the other of them were cut ditches across the country, the first of considerable size, and the next smaller; and at last diminutive drains, such as are cut in Greece through the panic fields. They then arrived at the Tigris ; near which there was a large and populous city, called Sitace, distant from the banks of the river only fifteen stadia.</p>
<p>Xenophon, by repeating the circumstance here, that the canals <unclear/> ere derived from the Tigris, lends additional weight to his prior statement, that at that time the northerly part of the plain of Babylonia was watered from the Tigris. The Arabs of Balad in. formed Captain Lynch, that there were anciently two canals, which ran across from the Tigris to the Euphrates—one from Istabalat, called Jalilu-i-Darb, near where the Dnjail, "Little Tigris," leaves the Tigris, and one that ran from the Dujail itself, called Bu Khaimah.
(Journal of It. G. S., vol. ix. p. 474.)</p>
<p>There are also in the same district the remains of several canals which were drawn in olden time from the river Tigris to flow back into the same river. Among the most remarkable are the Dujail, or Dijail,or Little Tigris; the Shat Aidha and the Ishakli. Akbara, a favourite residence of the Khalifs, was on the Shat Aidha.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross sought for Sitace at Shiriat at Baidha, or the White River, where there are extensive ruins, consisting of mounds and embankments, and the dry ditch of a canal extending northwards some miles, and westwards almost to the colossal ruin of Akka Knf or Accad—the only remaining example of an Assyrian or

<pb n="300"/>
Babylonian ruin not converted by the lapse of time and disintegration of materials into a tel or mound.</p>
<p>Having been led to reject the identification of the river Physcus with the modern Athaim, as surmised by Mr. Ross and Captain Lynch, upon the grounds advanced by Colonel Rawlinson, that if the Katur or Nahrawan canals existed in the time of Xenophon, they would represent the Physcus and not the Athaim, I was further induced, by considering the incompatibility of the distance between Shiriat al Baidha and Opis at the confluence of the Athaim, with that reported by Xenophon, to seek for the ruins of Sitace at or near the site of Akbara. Colonel Chesney has, by placing Opis at or a little above Kayim or Kaim, and close to the head of a second or lower branch of the Nahr-wan, called the Nahr al Risas, and which he identifies with the Physcus, got over this difficulty.</p>
<p>"In taking the distance backward," says Colonel Chesney, vol. ii. p. 221, “ at the average rate of the march through Asia Minor, or 2.608 geographical miles per parasang along the Upper Tigris,
(at the favourable season of the year,) from the Known point of the river Zab, there would be 130 geographical miles for the fifty parasangs to Opis, which places that city a little above Kaim, and close to the head of the Nahrawan, instead of being, as before supposed, some miles lower down near the river Athaim. Twenty parasangs, or fifty-two geographical miles, from the latter, the ancient bed of the Tigris, would place Sitace about ten miles northwest of Baghdad, near Sheriat el Beidha, the presumed site of the Sitace of Xenophon."</p>
<p>This identification, it will be observed, establishes the correspondence of the old bed of the river Tigris—the Shat Aidha—with the Tigris of Xenophon.</p>
<p>OPIS.—From the Tigris, the Greeks are described as proceeding in four days' march, a distance of twenty parasangs, to the river Physcus, which was a plethrum in breadth, and over which was a bridge. Here was situate a large town, called Opis.</p>
<p>The discussion of the true positioning of Sitace involved, it has ocen seen, a knowledge of the site of Opis, which was situated at the issue of the Katur, or Nahrawan, from the Tigris.* The Rev. Mr. Macmichael remarks upon this identification of a river with a canal, that it is not improbably the third instance in the work of Xenophon. “ Ainsworth," he says in the Appendix, (p. 339,) "following Colonel Rawlinson, who is inclined to identify the Physcus with the ancient canal, Katur or Nahrawan, (compare the case of the Daradax and Masca, called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποταμοί</foreign>, 1. iv. 10, n., and v. 4; the
<note type="footnote"> * Colonel Chesney's Al Kayim is situated, it has been observed, on the Nahr al Risas, a tributary to the Katur or Nahrawan; the ruins of Dura, and those called now Old Baghdad, are upon the Katur or Nahrawan proper. </note>

<pb n="301"/>
breadth also, (a plethrum,) which is uniformly that of canals, (v. 1; vii. 15,) somewhat favour the supposition."</p>
<p>Opis was a city of considerable commercial importance at one time, having, according to the learned Dr. Vincent, risen into emi. nence upon the decline of the Assyrian cities on the Tigris, and then again decayed in its turn, as Seleucia, and Apamea, the creation of the Seleucidae, became conspicuous ; hence its positioning is of great interest to comparative geography generally.</p>
<p>VILLAGES OF PARYSATIS.—From Opis the Greeks proceeded through Media, six days' march through a desert country, a distanqe of thirty parasangs, when they arrived at the villages of Parysatis, the mother of Cyrus and the king.</p>
<p>At 2.608 geographical miles for each of the thirty parasangs, or
78.24 geographical miles, the villages in question would have been situated, according to Colonel Chesney, (ii. 222,) about three miles beyond the Lesser Zab — a river concerning the existence of which Xenophon is as silent as he was regarding the Lake of Antioch and its tributaries.</p>
<p>The position of these villages, according to the distance stated in the text, would, says Dr. Anthon, (note to Xenophon, p. 163,) both in Lynch's and in Rich's maps, fall pretty nearly at the position marked Tel Kunus in the first, and Tel Geloos in the second. This is the same identification as in the “ Travels in the Track." It is however over-estimated, being laid down in the maps, instead of as in other cases corrected for the difficulties of road, which in most cases render my estimate of 3 geo. miles equal to not more than 2.5 on the map, making them really of the same value as accorded by Rennell, Colonel Chesney, Hamilton, and Layard.</p>
<p>CAENAE.—From the villages of Parysatis the Greeks advanced in a march of five days more through the desert, a distance of twenty parasangs, having the Tigris on their left. At the end of the first day's march, there was situate on the opposite bank of the river, a large and opulent city, called Caenae, whence the Barbarians brought over, on rafts made of hide, a supply of bread, cheese, and wine.</p>
<p>Captain Lynch having found some ruins with a canal called Senn, not far from the embouchure of the Great Zab on the opposite side of the Tigris, I was induced to identify the Gaenae of the Greeks with that spot, puzzled however at the same time to identify this site with the Scena of Strabo, and which according to the Amasian geographer was a remarkable city—the capital of the Seenite Arabs — eighteen schaeni or one hundred and eight milt.! from Seleucia, and with a canal which was carried thence to the confines of Babylonia.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the difficulty of getting a canal through tho hilly ranges south of Kalah Shirgat, still, considering the

<pb n="302"/>
correction given to the distances by Colonel Chesney, I am inclined to suppose that the site must be the same as the ruins at the lastmentioned place, and not exactly, as Colonel Chesney has it, at the ruins of the Ur of the Persians, which he says are three or four miles below Shirkat—or Toprak Kalahsi. (ii. p. 222.)</p>
<p>Kalah Shirgat, since the time when I first visited it in company with Layard, in 1840, has been the scene of many most remarkable and interesting discoveries in Assyrian Archaeology, made by that most successful explorer.</p>
<p>Among other monuments of olden time, a cylinder, a splendid relic, containing 800 lines of beautiful writing, at least 100 years older than the oldest monument hitherto discovered in Assyria, was found here. It was, when found, broken into a hundred fragments, and in some parts even reduced to powder; but the whole bas been carefully joined together, and barely a dozen lines lost.</p>
<p>Colonel Rawlinson states (Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, vol. xv. p. xvi. et seq.) that it contains the bulletins of Tiglath Pileser
1., a king who is mentioned in the annals of Assur-akh-pal, as a remote ancestor; and as Divanuras, the builder of Calah, must, Colonel Rawlinson thinks, intervene between the connected series and this king, and as there is no mention on the cylinder either of Calah or Nineveh; the Colonel is led to believe that the capital of the empire at that early period, that is, before the building of Nineveh, was Kilch Shirgat, as he spells it, itself, and which is everywhere on the cylinder named Assur, as it is also in the wellknown sitting figure obtained from the same place by Layard, and now in the British Museum.</p>
<p>This ancient and pre-Ninevite capital of the Assyrian empire being then named Assur, was also, according to Colonel Rawlinson, the Allasar of Genesis, of which Arioch was the king. It is also the Tel Assur of the Targums, which is used for the Mosaic Resell; and instead, therefore, of Resell being between Nineveh and Calah, it should be Calah, which was between Nineveh and Resen. “ I consider,” adds the Colonel, "these three sites to be now determinately fixed—Nineveh at Nebbi Yunus, Calah at Nimrud, and Resen at Shirgat."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding such high authority, I cannot help feeling that there will yet be found no reason for thus forcing the reading of the Mosaic record. The term Assur has been found at Nimrud as well as at Shirgat.* And it is very likely to apply to the
<note type="footnote"> * Ross (Jour. It. G. S. vol. ix. p. 451) calls it Kalah Sherkat. Rich,

country rather than to the city. If, as I suspect it will still turn out to be the case, Nimrud is ever identified by satisfactory paleographic research with Resen, and Kalah Shirgat with Calah, the Biblical expression will be found to be correct. Colonel Rawlinson has himself been induced to change his opinions with progressive inquiry, he having in 1839 identified Calah with Holwan near Sar Puli Zohab (Journ. 'of Roy. Geo. Soc. ix. p. 35 et seq.); and in
1849 or 50, identified the same place with Nimrud. (Journ. of Roy. Asiat. Soc. xii. p. 417.)</p>
<p>In the “Memoir on Cuneiform Inscriptions," published in the eleventh volume of the Jour. Roy. Asiat. Soc., Colonel Rawlinson speaks of Athur-a and Athur-aya as the cuneiform expression for our Assyria. He then adds in a note, the Arabic geographers always give the title of Athur to the great ruined capital near the mouth of the Upper Zab. If so, that place is just as likely to be the Tel Assur of the Targums as Kalah Shirgat, and consequently, as far as any identification founded on such data will go-the same as Resen.</p>
<p>RIVER ZABATUS. Soon after, they arrived at the river Zabatus, the breadth of which was four plethra. The river Zab is too well known to detain us long. It is in the present day called Zab Ala. Thevenot and Tavernier called it Zarb and Zarbe. It is the Lycus of the older geographers, with the exception of Pliny, who calls it Zerbis, and Marcellinus, who mispells it Diaba. The Zab is one of the principal confluents of the Tigris, and at certain seasons of the year brings down a larger body of water than the main stream.</p>
<p>There are many tels or mounds of ruin on the south side of the Zab near its confluence with the Tigris, in the plain of Shumanuk, or Shomanok, now tenanted by the Tai Arabs, some of which the indefatigable Layard caused to be excavated by the Jehesh Arabs under his pay. Among the most remarkable of these is the lofty mound of Kashaf or Keshaf, an artificial platform of earth and unbaked bricks resting upon limestone rock, and crowned by the remains of a deserted fort, — the mounds and ruins called Mukhamur or Mokhamour, in the pastoral plains between the Karajuk hills and the Tigris—the mound of Abu Jerdah—that of Abu Shitha or Abou Sheetha, and eight others enumerated by Layard, all indicative of a large and prosperous population in olden times.</p>
<p>Speaking more particularly of the mound called Abu-Shitha, Layard says, (p. 225,) " Near this ruin, perhaps at its very foot, must have taken place an event which led to one of the most celebrated episodes of ancient history. Here were treacherously seized Clearchus, Proxenus, Menon, Agias, and Socrates ; and Xenophon, elected to the command of the Greek Auxiliaries, commenced the ever-memorable retreat of the Ten Thousand. The camp

<pb n="304"/>
of Tissaphernes, dappled with its many-coloured tents, and glittering with golden arms and silken standards, the gorgeous display of Persian pomp, probably stood on the Kordereh, (Kur Darah, valley of Cyrus ?) between Abou Shcetha and the Kasr. The Greeks having taken the lower road to the west of the Karaehok range, through a plain even then as now a desert, turned to the east, and crossed the spur of the mountain, where we had recently seen the tents of the Howar, in order to reach the fords of the Zab."</p>
<p>PASS OF THE ZABATUS.— Misfortunes awaited the Greeks at this point, and active hostilities ensuing upon the passage of the Zab, that passage was deferred for a short time. The Persians having been described by Xenophon as taking up a position at the ford over the Zab, I was induced to identify the place of passage, not withstanding its distance from the confluence of the Zab and Tigris, with the ford at Kulak Kupar, which is beyond the ferry called Kulak Izidi, or the pass of the Yezidees.</p>
<p>“ The fact of their leaving the Tigris," says the Rev. Mr. Macmichael in the Appendix to the Xenophon, (p. 340,) “ and marciting up the Zab before crossing it, though not expressly stated, la sufliciently indicated by the remark that they arrived at the Tigris near Larissa (iii.4.6) after two marches from the ford. It is also to be added to this, that it seems probable that they crossed above the junction of the Khazir su or Bumadus, as they are described as passing on their way to Larissa, a valley formed by a torrent. ”</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney makes the Greeks cross the Zab near its confluence,“ probably in boats," (ii. 222). Layard, who has examined the country about the confluence of the two rivers with great care, says, “ the ford by which the Greeks crossed the great Zab
(Zabates) may, I think, be accurately determined. It is still the principal ford in this part of the river, and must, from the nature of the bed of the stream, have been so from the earliest periods. It is about twenty-five miles from the confluence of the Zab and Tigris. A march of twenty-five stadia, or nearly three miles, in the direction of Larissa, would hive brought them to the Ghazer or Burmadus; and this stream was, I have little doubt, the deep valley formed by the torrent where Mithridates, venturing to attack the retreating army, was signally defeated." (Discov. in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon, p. 60.)</p>
<p>Layard is wrong in saying that “ Mr. Ainsworth would take the Greeks up to the modern ferry, where there could never have been a ford." I said distinetly (Trav. in the Track, &amp;c., p. 119) the actual ferry is at Kelek Izedi, (or Kulak Izidi,) but beyond this, at Kelek Gopar, (Kulak Kupar,) the river is said to be fordable at favourable seasons. This Mr. Rassam and myself ascertained on the spot. As it appears, nowever, that there is a ford

<pb n="305"/>
lower down the river, and yet above the confluence of the Khazirsu, it is evidently useless to go higher up the river in search of a spot for the passage of the Greeks.</p>
<p>LARISSA.—Having crossed the Zabatus, the Greeks were only enabled, owing to the hostile front presented by Mithridates, the satrap of the new district they had entered upon, to advance some five and twenty stadia to some villages on the plain. The next morning they started earlier than usual on account of the ravine, but the Persians did not attack them till they had crossed the torrent, and being driven back, the Greeks travelled the rest of the day without molestation, arriving at the river Tigris, where was a large deserted city, the name of which was Larissa, and which the Modes had formerly inhabited.</p>
<p>The identity of the Larissa of Xenophon with the ruins of Nimrud, the scene of Layard's most remarkable discoveries, appearing to be undisputed by those who have written since the publication of the " Travels in the Track," it only remains to notice some facts that have sprung out of more recent researches.</p>
<p>The learned Boehart first advanced the supposition that this Assyrian city was the same as the primeval city, called Resen in the Bible, and that the Greeks having asked its name, were answered. At Resen, the article being prefixed, and from whence they made Larissa, in an easy transposition. I adopted this presumed identity as extremely probable, and Colonel Chesney (ii. 223) has done the same—not as an established fact, but as a presumed identity.</p>
<p>Layard was satisfied with looking upon Nimrud as a quarter of Nineveh. " That the ruins at Nimroud were within the preeincts of Nineveh," he says in Nineveh and its Remains, (vol. ii. p. 243,) " if they do not alone mark its site, appears to be proved by Strabo, and by Ptolemy's statement, that the city was on the Lycus, corroborated by the tradition preserved by the earliest Arab geographers. Yakut, and others, mention the ruins of Athur, near Selamiyah, which gave the name of Assyria to the province; and Iun Said expressly states, that they were those of the city of the Assyrian kings who destroyed Jerusalem. They are still called, as it has been shown, both Athur and Nimroud."</p>
<p>Certain cuneiform characters represented in Layard's Nineveh and its Remains, (vol. ii. p. 228, 229,) were, from their frequent recurrence both in the sculptures and the bricks, supposed to represent the name of Asshur. Dr. Hineks deemed them to represent either the name, or an abbreviation of the name, of Athur, the country of Assyria. " It is possible," Layard remarks upon this, " that Nineveh, or Athur, may be indiscriminately used in speaking of the country."</p>
<p>Athor, or Athyr, has also been read by Dr. Hincks as the name of the presiding divinity on the monuments of Assyria, somewhat
<note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note>

<note type="footnote"> x </note>

<pb n="306"/>
we suppose, in the same way, only wIth more religious feeling mixed up with it, that Britannia represents Great Britain.</p>
<p>In 1846, Colonel Rawlinson, speaking of Nimrud, noticed it as probably the Rehoboth of Scripture, but he added in a note, " I have no reason for identifying it with Rehoboth, beyond its evident antiquity, and the attribution of Resen and Calah to other sites.
(Journal of Roy. Asiat. Soc. vol. x. p. 26.) At this time Colonel Rawlinson identified Calah with Holwan or Sir Pul-i-Zohab, and hesen, or Dasen, with Yasin Teppeh in the plain of Shahrizur in murdistan. (See note to p. 23 op. cit.)</p>
<p>In 1849, (Journ. of Roy. Asiat. Soc. vol. xi. p. 10,) Colonel Rawlinson said, " The Arabic geographers always give the title of Athur to the great ruined capital near the month of the Upper Zab. The ruins are now usually known by the name of Nimrud It would seem highly probable that they represent the Calah of Genesis, for the Samaritan Pentateuch names this city Lachisa, which is evidently the same title as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λαρισσα</foreign> of Xenophon, the Persian <foreign xml:lang="grc">Υ</foreign> being very usually replaced both in Median and Babylonian by a guttural."</p>
<p>In 1850, (Journ. of Roy. Asiat. Soc. vol. xii.,) Colonel Rawlin. son added the discovery of a cuneiform inscription bearing the title Levekh, which he reads Halukh. "Nimrud," says the distinguished palaeographist, " the great treasure-house which has furnished us with all the most remarkable specimens of Assyrian sculpture, although very probably forming one of that group of cities, which, in the time of the prophet Jonas, wore known by the common name of Nineveh, has no claim itself, I think, to that particular appellation. The title by which it is designated on the bricks and slabs that form its buildings, I read doubtfully as Levekh, and I suspect this to be the original form of the name which appears as Calah in Genesis, and Halah in Kings and Chronicles, and which indeed, as the capital of Calaehene, must needs have occupied some site in the immediate vicinity."</p>
<p>Lastly, in 1853, (Journ. of Roy. Asiat. Soc. vol. xv. p. vi. et seq.,) Colonel Rawlinson describes the remarkable cylinder before alluded to as found at Kilah Shirgat, which establishes that site to have been the most ancient capital of the Assyrian empire, and to have been called Assur as well as Nimrud and Nineveh Proper. This Assur, wo have seen, he identifies with the Tel Assur of the Targums, which is used for the Mosaic Resen; and instead, therefore, of Resen being between Nineveh and Calah, it should be Calah, which was between Nineveh and Resen.</p>
<p>But, notwithstanding such very high authority, the conclusion thus arrived at does not appear to be perfectly satisfactory. The discovery of the expression Levekh, and its analogy in the Samaritan Lachisa and the Greek Larissa, is very curious and very

<pb n="307"/>
remarkable, but not conclusive. The name Assur, or Athur, occurs just as frequently in connexion with Nimrud as with Shirgat, and therefore the same argument of its being the Tel Assur of the Targums, which is used for the Mosaic Resen, would apply to the one as well as to the other. It is possible to imagine two cities like Nineveh and Resen to have been within some twenty miles of one another, but it is not so easy to imagine that in after times one was in the province of Adiabene, the other in that of Calachene. This part of the subject will be found discussed at length in the " Papers of the Syro-Egyptian Society," (vol. i. part ii.).</p>
<p>The whole question indeed regarding Nineveh and Assur appears to be involved in a great deal of philological confusion. It is evident that the name of the country came from Assur or Athur, and we cannot therefore feel surprised at finding the name at Kilah Shirgat, afterwards transposed to Nimrud and to Nineveh, just as we find the Chaldean priests using it in the present day in their bibles at Musul or Mausil. It does not appear, therefore, that any correct data will be derived for naming any of the Assyrian cities from the presence of this epithet.</p>
<p>Then again, with regard to Nineveh, it may at one time have designated one place, at another time another place, according to where the king took up his abode: and again, it may, in the time of Jonah, have embraced the whole group of cities, as Colonel Rawlinson remarks, in Assyria Proper. Layard does not dispute that the different portions of Nineveh, thus comprehensively viewed, may have had different names. Much light has already been thrown upon the history of the different Assyrian cities and edifices, as well as upon the dwellers therein, and that is quite sufficient to show that we are as yet only upon the threshold of what will be eliminated by the labours of our truly zealous and laborious paleographers and archaeologists.</p>
<p>Since the above was written, a letter from Colonel Rawlinson appears in the Athenaeum, No. 1381, making mention of the discovery in the S. E. palace at Nimrud, of a perfect statue of the god Nebo, with an inscription on the breast, stating that the figure in question was executed by a certain sculptor of Lakisa or Calah, and dedicated by him to the Lord Phal-lukha, king of Assyria, and to his Lady, Sammuramit, Queen of the Palace. In the same inscription the territorial name of Sutgan is mentioned in conjunction with that of the city of Calah, being, Colonel Rawlinson says, the title given by the Samaritan interpreter for the Hebrew of Rehoboth Ir. The Colonel identifies the king and queen here noticed together with the Belochus and Semiramis of the Greek Assyrian lists. He believes Semiramis to have been the daughter of the king of Medo-Armenia, to have married Phal-lukha, the king of Armenia, when she changed her name from Atossa to
<note type="footnote"> z </note>

<pb n="308"/>
Semiramis, and to have reigned with her husband as joint monarch of Nineveh in the eighth century before Christ.</p>
<p>MESPILA.—From Larissa the Greeks are described as proceedmg, in one day's journey, six parasangs, to a large unoccupied fortress, situated near a city, the name of which was Mespila. Upon the data here given, I identified the fortress with the ruins at Yarumjah, and Mespila with Nineveh. Colonel Chesncy appears to coincide in this view of the subject. " That Larissa and Mespila are represented by the ruins of Nimroud and Kouyunjik," Layard says, (Nineveh and Babylon, p. Gl,) " no one can reasonably doubt."</p>
<p>Colonel Rawlinson however says, (Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc. vol. xii. p. 419,) " It seems to me very possible, that Xenophon's name, of Mespila may denote Mosul, and not Nineveh." The term Mespila or Meso-pulai, "middle pass or gates," would certainly appear to apply to the pass of the river between Musul and Kuyunjik or Nabbi Yunus, and there may have been ruins on both banks, for a great mound still exists in Musul, not far from the river, but there is no evidence of such extensive ruins, as are described by Xenophon as being at Mespila, having existed on the right bank of the river, whilst we know they do occur on the left. Rennell has, however, also conjectured Musul to be derived from Mesulae, a corruption of Meso-pulai. It does not matter much. Xenophon's name, no doubt, applied to the pass of the Tigris, and therefore to Musul and Nineveh, and his description of ruins to the latter.</p>
<p>VILLAGES BEYOND MESPILA.—The Greeks proceeded from the pass of the Tigris, one day's journey, a distance of four parasangs, to some villages where there was plenty of corn. Fertility is the characteristic of the plain of Nineveh to the present day, and there are no want of villages. From the data here given, I identified the particular villages at which the Greeks encamped with Tel Kaif, an Assyrian mound with a village or small town at its foot. Colonel Chesney joins me in this identification. Layard, however, says, " they probably halted near the modern village of Batnai, between Tel Kef and Tel Eskof, an ancient site exactly four hours, by the usual caravan road, from Kouyunjik." There is no doubt that Tel Kaifis not above nine geog. miles from Kuyunjik, and Batnai is twelve. But this is allowing the full three geog. miles to the parasang, and that when the Greeks were harassed throughout the journey by Tissaphernes. Tel Kaif is evidently also an old Assyrian site, which is not so certain with respect to Batnai, and I therefore, considering all the circumstances of the site, prefer the first identification.</p>
<p>PALACE AND VILLAGES.—The Greeks remained at the villages on the Assyrian plain the ensuing day, after which they proceeded through the open country, five days' march, till thev came to hills, beyond which was a kind of palace and several villages round it.

<pb n="309"/>
The first bills that are met with in proceeding northwards from Assyria to Karduchia, are those which constitute the triple range, designated as the Jibal Abyad by the Arabs, and Cha Spi by the Kurds, both signifying white hille," and immediately beyond them is the castle of Zakhu, with villages around it, like a feudal castle of olden times. In no part of the journey do the circumstances of the case more closely correspond with Xenophon's descriptions, especially of the difficulties met with in passing the hilly range, and the unforeseen opposition they met with in the now wooded valleys between the ranges.</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney (ii. 224) and Layard (Nineveh and Babylon, p. 61) both agree with me in this identification. It is remarkable that Xenophon does not mention the Khabur, which Dr. Grant confounded with the Chebar of Scripture—the Khabur of Mesopotamia-althongh he must have crossed that viver either by a ford or bridge.</p>
<p>VILLAGE IN TilE PLAIN.—There being plenty of provisions at Zakhu, the Greeks remained there three days, and on the fourth they went down into the plain. Xenophon neglects here to notice either the Khabur or its tributary the Hazil, both of which the army must apparently have crossed. They are reported as having eneampod at the first village they came to, which I have supposed might correspond with Tel Kubbin, where a mound of ruin marks an ancient site, but Layard does not think they got beyond the Hazil su. The first village in the plain in the present day is Bidari, inhabited by Chaldeans.</p>
<p>FOOT OF TItE MOUNTAINS.—The Greeks evidently continued their march across the plain of Zakhu—the Romaion Ager of Procopius—till they reached the foot of the hills south of Jizirah. A superior knowledge of the country had, however, been turned to account by the Persians in the mean time, and the Greeks, to their astonishment, found the enemy in possession of the heights over wnich they necessarily must pass, whilst the troops of Ariacus and Tissaphernes pressed upon the rear.</p>
<p>The scene of this second conflict in the outlying mountains of Kurdistan I have identified with the low hills which constitute that spur of the Jibal Jndi which advances immediately beyond the plain of Zakhu down to the banks of the Tigris, and where is the now ruinous castle of Rabahi—the Rabdium of the Low Empire, Tur Abdin of Al Wakidis' History of the Conquest of Mesopotamia by the Saracens, and Tur Rabdin of the Jihan Numa. Colonel Chesney agrees with me in this explanation of matters, but Layard takes the Greeks (p. 62) all the way to Fynyk or Finik, a view of the subject that will meet with very little support from those who will be at the pains to consider the details carefully</p>
<p>KURDISH PLAIN WITH VILLAGES.—The Greeks having driven the enemy from the commanding position which they held, they

<pb n="310"/>
descended into a plain, in which were many villages, stored with excellent provisions, lying along the river Tigris. This plain exists precisely in the position indicated, between the Rabahi spur of the Jibal Judi and the low eminences which again block up the plain opposite to Jizirah ibn Umar, the Zozarta of the Chaldeans, and Bezabde of the Romans, and at the farther or northern end of which is the Chaldean village of Mansuriyah. There was formerly a bridge over the Tigris in this plain, the ruins of which still exist.</p>
<p>The Greeks are described as being much perplexed, for on one side of them were exceeding high mountains, and on the other a river of such depth, that when they sounded it, their spears did not rise above the water.</p>
<p>They were also obliged to retrace their steps to a certain extent. The Persians having set fire to some of the villages before them, they had to return in search of provisions to some that were unburnt. These villages may have been at the westerly end of the plain of Zakhu, where are in the present day Kalah Salahsani or Sayid Bay's castle, Nahrwan, Girgi Pedros or Afar Yiorgio,
(Church of St. George,) Zibarra, Wasit, Perishabur, and other villages mostly Chaldean. I prefer this view of the case to the one I first entertained, that they went up the valley of Mar Yuhannah. The whole district, however, as Colonel Chesney (ii.
225) justly remarks, included the tract round Jizirah ibn Umar.</p>
<p>Layard (Nineveh and Babylon, p. 62) identifies the villages in question with those still found around Funduk, but it appears evident from what follows in chapter i. of the 10th book of the Katabnsis, that the Greeks had not yet fought their way through the chief pass of the Tigris, and which is met with immediately beyond Jizirah ibn Umar and the valley of Mar Yuhannah, or the Dargilah of Layard—Fynyk, ancient Phoenica, commanding the pass in question from above. I cannot but attribute the great discrepancy that occurs here between my identifications and those admitted by Layard, to the circumstances of his having travelled from the north, I from the south. Coming in the first direction, Layard first saw the plains of Assyria through the gap made by the river stretching before him, as it were at his feet, from the heights of Funduk, and all other passes were from that moment looked at as insignificant; coming, on the contrary, from the south, the great range of the Jibal Judi seems to Item in the Tigris immediately beyond Jizirah, like a mighty wall of rock. There is no mistaking this great physical feature in
.lie configuration of the country. The pass of the Tigris, where the Greeks stopped awe-struck at the formidable aspect of the country before them, was at or near the Bezabde of the Romans. That town has been from time immemorial the fortress which has commanded the great pass of the Tigris.</p>

<pb n="311"/>

<p>PASS OF TilE TIGRIS.—The Greeks are described in the next book as having arrived at a spot where the Tigris was quite impassable from its depth and width, and where there was no passage along its banks, as the Karduchian mountains hung steep over the stream, and hence their further progress became a matter of serious and anxious discussions.</p>
<p>This is the great pass of the Tigris I have just alluded to immediately beyond Jizirah ibn Umar. There cannot be a moment's question upon the subject. It was a point of such great importance in the retreat, that it is made the scene of discussion of all the principal routes that presented themselves to get out of the country, and Xenophon begins another book with the account of the passage of this remarkable pass, which the Greeks effected with their characteristic gallantry and expedition, arriving beyond the summit in certain villages of Karduchians that lay dispersed in the valleys and recesses of the mountains. It is perhaps scarcely necessary to say that Colonel Chesney quite coincides with this view of the matter.</p>
<p>VILLAGES OF KAUDUCHIANS.—The pass of the Tigris will be found minutely described in the Travels in the Track, p. 154. After the summit of the pass is gained, the line of hills and cliffs gradually recede from the river, till suddenly, from having a nearly horizontal stratification, additional beds of rock make their appearance in front of the cliffs, dipping nearly vertically to the west, and rising in rude irregular conical summits, in front of what had been hitherto one continuous wall of rock. The recesses thus left between the hills are in the present day the seat of villages, as they were in the time of Xenophon, and the crags in front and in the rear bristle with the small and rude rock-forts of the Kurds. This place corresponds to the Phoenica of Amm. Marcellinus, of the existence of which Mr. Rich obtained some intelligence; but as I was, I believe, the first traveller to visit it in modern times, I cannot refrain from quoting the description given of this remarkable spot in the Tray. in the Track, &amp;c. p. 154 et seq.</p>
<p>" My surprise and pleasure may be well imagined (after crossing the before-mentioned wild rocky pass) at finding extending before me a considerable expanse of well-wooded gardens, which stretched from the hills down to the water-side, and for about two miles up the river-course. Nothing could exceed the rich luxuriance of these groves and orchards; there were open spaces here and there for maize, melon, gourd, and cucumber, but otherwise the groves of plum, apricot, and peach appeared almost inaccessible, from the dense lower growth of fig-trees and pomegranates, themselves again half hid beneath clustering vines. Overlooking this scene of vegetative splendour, and upon the side of the hill, were the ruins -if a castellated building, the battlemented wall and irregularly dispersed towers of which still remain. This building

<pb n="312"/>
covered a considerable space, being six hundred yards in depth, by eleven hundred in length. Traces of out-works, and of buildings connected with it, were also quite evident, stretching downward to the gardens.</p>
<p>" On two mounds, not far distant from each other, and close to the river, are the ruins of two smaller castles of similar character to the large one, only with double battlements, and consequently rising more loftily trom the deep green groves, in the midst of which they are situated.</p>
<p>" In a deep and rocky glen at the head of these gardens is situated the village of Güli or Kuli Shirafi, (so called from its being in a narrow strait or pass,) many of the houses of which are hewn out of rock, and some of them out of fallen masses, which often stand erect at the foot of the cliffs, like great obelisks with a door-way in front: on the cliffs around are also numerous sepulchral grots, and the remains of aqueducts.</p>
<p>" To the north of this glen is another of greater dimensions, in which is the modern village of Fynvk, containing about one hundred houses, many of them excavated. The village is defended by several Kurd forts, two of which were on the opposite hill-tops, while other small ones succeeded to one another along the crest and acclivities down to the village. This pass of the Tigris was rendered quite impracticable to strangers by the Kurds of these villages till the time of Rashid Pasha."</p>
<p>It is manifest that it is these villages to which Xenophon alludes when he speaks of such being in rocky recesses. Layard however looks for these villages at Funduk (p. 62).</p>
<p>Whilst resting during the heat of day in the gardens down by the river Tigris, Layard was lucky enough to have had information brought to him of the existence of sculptures in one of these ravines—the description appears to apply rather to that of Knli Shirafi than to that of Finik or Fynyk proper. " We rode," he says,
(p. 54,) " up a narrow and shady ravine, through which leapt a brawling torrent, watering fruit trees and melon beds. The rocks on both sides were honey-combed with tombs. The bas-relief is somewhat above the line of cultivation, and is surrounded by excavated chambers. It consists of two figures, dressed in loose vests and trousers, one apparently resting his hand on the shoulder of the other. There are the remains of an inscription, but too much weather-worn to be copied with any accuracy. The costume of the figures, and the forms of the characters as far as they can be distinguished, prove that the tablet belongs to the Parthia. period. It closely resembles monuments of the same epoch existing in the mountains of Persia."</p>
<p>What further satisfies me that the glen or ravine which my informants told me was called Kuli Shirafi is the same as that in which Layard found the bas-reliefs, is that Layard adds, " Beneath

<pb n="313"/>
them (the figures) is a long cutting, and tunnel in the rock, probably an ancient watercourse for irrigation, to record the construction of which the tablets may have been sculptured."</p>
<p>Layard also discovered some sculptures of a similar character in the valley which leads from Jizirah to Darghilah, the former stronghold of Badir Khan Bay, or as I have called it from a Chaldean church, and the seat of a Chaldean episcopacy, the valley of Mar Yuhannah. These sculptures were about two miles from the high road, near a small fort built by Mir Saif-ad-din, the hereditary chief of Buhtan, in whose name Badir Khan Bay exercised his authority. There were two tablets, one above the other; the upper contained a warrior on horseback, the lower a simple figure. Although no traces of inscription remain, the bas-relief may confidently be assigned to the same period, Layard says, as that of Fynyk.</p>
<p>PASS OF SCRUTINY.—Beyond Finik, or Fynyk, the hills and the river recede from one another, the latter being closed up amidst precipitous cliffs, and to avoid this long precipitous bend, the road is carried over the hills by the village of Finduk or Funduk. As the Greeks did not start from Finik till after breakfast, more than seven to eight geographical miles cannot be allowed to the first day's march thence, which would carry them to the slope of those heights where are now the remains of Kunakti and other castles, which defended the approach to Finduk. There is only one pass in the line of road thus traversed, adapted for the purposes mentioned by Xenophon, of examining the men in a file, and scrutinizing their baggage or impedimenta, and that is the ravine of the rivulet of Zawiyah, which is deep and narrow, and to which there is only one descent on either side, the remainder being vertical cliffs in which are here and there a sepulchral grotto.</p>
<p>PASS OF FINDUK.—On the next day a great storm arose in the very place to expect such, on the ascent of the highlands of Finduk; but they were obliged to go on, for their provisions failed them. Beyond the castle of Kunakti, the road enters a narrow glen, and winds round along similar passes, till turning the face of a lofty precipice, it advances upon more open and cultivated highlands by the village or town of Finduk, down again into the valley of the Tigris, where are the villages of Kuwarru, Baravan, and others, inhabited in the present day by Syrian Christians.</p>
<p>Layard gives an amusing account of his passage through Finduk, whose inhabitants, he says, during the rule of Badir Khan Bay were notorious amongst even the savage tribes of Buhtan, for their hatred and insolence to Christians. At the time of my visit Badir Khan had not been subdued, and the dangers of the road were proportionably greater, but the only annoyance the savage old chieftain Rasul gave me, (if it can be even so termed,) was to ask me contemptuously if I was a Christian.</p>

<pb n="314"/>

<p>The Greeks were subjected to much annoyance by the Kurde on this passage, and Xenophon was irritated at Cheirisophus hastening, as he deemed, too rashly forward; but the rival leader pointed to the river pass and mountains before him, and urged the necessity of haying hurried forward to secure the position they were in. That this was on the banks of the Tigris is evidenced by a prisoner they had taken, promising, under fear of death, to lead them over the hills, instead of by the river-banks, which are indeed at this point impassable, except when the waters are low, besides being commanded by the neighbouring hills.</p>
<p>PASS OF KULAK.—At the point where they had now arrived then, that is, where the Tigris is hemmed in by the mountains, and yet there is no short cut over the latter, as at Finduk; the Greeks were obliged to detach a party to take possession of the heights before they could attempt to force the passage below. Notwithstanding these precautions, the Kurds rolled down great stones upon the Greeks and entailed considerable delay.</p>
<p>The scene of this event appears to have been at the entrance of the pass, where is a ferry and villages on each side of the river known as Kulak, as is also the ferry on the Zab—pronounced by the Kurds, Kelek or Chelek. At this point a rivulet of clear water flows into the Tigris, by a narrow ravine, which is hemmed in, as the Tigris is also from this point northwards, by perpendicular rocks. A road, carried up in part by steps cut in the rock, leads up the <unclear>eliff</unclear> to the ruins of a eastle that once commanded this important position.</p>
<p>To gain this pass, the Greeks had to fight three separate con. flicts, on as many distinct eminences; after which they arrived at a number of good houses, and in the midst of abundance of provisions. Wine was so abundant, that they kept it in excavations under ground, which were plastered over.</p>
<p>On emerging from the hills that hem in the river below Kulak, there are at the present day no villages close to the river, but there are several in the interior, and a little farther on the ruins of a large village, and of a Khan built of stone. Kulak, with its tall Kurdish castle, stands on the right bank of the river, a little farther on. The plastered cisterns noticed by Xenophon are still to be met with in Kurdistan, Armenia, and Syria.</p>
<p>THE CENTRITES—The next day the Greeks pursued their way one party as usual ascending the mountains from behind to drive the enemy away, and leave the passage below free to their comrades. By these means they were enabled to force another wooded and picturesque pass, that is met with north of Kulak, and to reach the more open country where the ISuhtan chai or Centrites joins the Tigris.</p>
<p>The army did not encamp on the banks of the Centrites, but, as is described by Xenophon, above the plain, where are some villages

<pb n="315"/>
of Chaldeans in the present day. At the point of junction of the Tigris and Centrites is the ancient Armenian site of Til, or Till,
(written by Layard, Tilleh,) which was celebrated in history as favoured by Tigranes, and as the burial-place of several of the early Armenian pontiffs.</p>
<p>Layard having got the Greeks on their first day's march over the Karduchian hills, as far as Finduk, he says, “There now remained about ten parasangs to the plain through which flows the eastern branch of the Tigris; but the country was difficult, and at this time of the year (nearly mid-winter) the lower road along the river was impassable. The Greeks had therefore to force their way over a series of difficult passes, all stoutly defended by warlike tribes. They were consequently four days in reaching the Centrites, or eastern Tigris, the united waters of the rivers of Bitlis, Sort, and Bohtan."</p>
<p>FORD OF TilE CENTRITES.—The passage of the river was opposed by an united army of Armenians, Mardians, or, as it was previously read, Mygdonians, and Chaldeans. These mercenaries were drawn up on high banks, three or four hundred feet from the river; and the only road that was visible, was one that led upward, apparently a work of art, and the Greeks attempted to cross the river at this point, but without success. They in consequence retreated, and when they had encamped on the banks of the river, they found their previous station occupied by the Kurds.</p>
<p>That day, therefore, and the following night they remained where they were in great perplexity. But the next morning two young men came to Xenophon, when he was at breakfast, and told him they had found a ford. This ford was at a distance of about four stadia, and the Greeks effected the passage by a series of ingenious manoeuvres which are described in the text.</p>
<p>Layard, who forded the Buhtan chai in the month of September I believe, (he disembarked at Trebizond on the 31st of August,) says, “ We crossed the lower or eastern ford, which we found wide and exceedingly rapid, the water, however, not reaching above the saddle-girths. The villagers raised the luggage, and supported the horses against the current, which rushing over loose and slippery stones, affording an uncertain footing, threatened to sweep the animals down the stream. * * The spot at which we crossed was one of peculiar interest. It was here that the Ten Thousand in their memorable retreat forded this river, called, by Xenophon, the Centrites
(p. 49). The next paragraph but one he says, " The ford was deep, and its passage disputed by a formidable force of Armenians, Mygdonians, (Mardians?) and Chaldeans, drawn up on an eminence
300 or 400 feet from the river. In this strait Xenophon dreamt that he was in chains, and that suddenly his fetters burst asunder of their own accord. His dream was fulfilled when two youths casually found a more practicable ford, by which the army

<pb n="316"/>
after a skilful stratagem on the part of their commander, safely reached the opposite bank.</p>
<p>These two paragraphs contradict one another. Layard also says at page 63, “The stream was rapid, the water reaching to the breast, and the ford, owing to the unevenness of the bottorn and the loose slippery stones, exceeding difficult; such, it will be remembered, we found to be the case near Tilleh. The opposite banks were, moreover, defended by the combined forces of the Armenians, Mygdonians, and Chaldeans. It was impossible to cross the river at this spot in the face of the enemy. At length a ford was discovered higher up, and Xenophon, by skilful strategy, effected the passage. This must have been at a short distance from Tilleh, as the river, narrowed between rocky banks, is no longer fordable higher up.”</p>
<p>This latter statement is founded in error, for Mr. Rassam and myself forded it a few miles higher up, in the month of September, when the water was in its deepest part not above three feet, but generally two.</p>
<p>Supposing the Greeks to have first attempted the ford at Til, it is evident, according to Layard's own showing, that they crossed ultimately higher up the river. But the fact is that the point at which the Greeks passed must be determined by where they first reached the river-banks. On reaching the plain of the Centrites, the Tigris makes a great bend to the westward before receiving the Centrites, and as the course of the Greeks lay northward, conceive it very unlikely that they would have turned unneces sarily out of their way towards the junction of the two rivers. Again, at the point where they approached the river, the enemy is described as occupying high banks from 300 to 400 feet from the river. This description would correspond with that part of the valley where the Buhtan chai is first hemmed in by low hills, now called Janiminiyah. About four miles beyond this there are in the present day the ruins of a bridge, over which lay formerly the road to Radwan. Beyond this again is an artificial causeway carried up the face of a limestone rock, partly by steps cut out of the rock tself, and partly by a causeway paved with large blocks of stone. This is the high-way to Sa'art, and appears to be of remote antiquity. Here is also a ford, but as the river is fordable at its embouchure, it is evident there may be many fords between the two. It is not necessary to presume then that the higher ford was crossed, although the reference to the artificial <unclear>causeway</unclear> carried up the face of the cliffs, and which remains to the present day, is very curious; but as it appears almost certain that they did not approach the river till where it is hemmed in by low hills, and which is precisely what they would be expected to do from the route taken and the configuration of the valley, and as they crossed about four stadia above that point, the place where

<pb n="317"/>
the Greeks forded the river was manifestly beyond the said low <unclear/> nills.</p>
<p>PALACE OF ARMENIAN SATRAP.-Having forced the passage of the Centrites, the Greeks are described as proceeding through Armenia, over plains and gently sloping hills, a distance of not less than five parasangs, arriving ultimately at a village of considerable size, which contained a palace for the satrap ; upon most of the houses there were towers, and provisions in great plenty. This spot, by the distance given, would appear to correspond with the town now called Sa'art or Se'ert.</p>
<p>TilE TELEBOAS.—The Greeks are described as advancing from the palace of the Armenian satrap, two days' journey, a distance often parasangs, until they passed beyond the sources of the river Tigris. From hence they advanced, three days' journey, fifteen parasangs, to the river Teleboas, a stream not large, indeed, but of much beauty; and there were many villages on its banks. This part of the country was called Western Armenia.</p>
<p>There is a difficulty about the identification of the Teleboas, which has been revived by Mr. Layard's going back to the old view of the case. My ideas, as propounded from an unbiassed consideration of the facts of the case, are given in the “Travels in the Track, <unclear/>&amp;c.,” in the following words.</p>
<p>“Had the Greeks marched by the great road from Sa'art to Bitlis, the distance here given at the onset would take them to the difficult pass called the Darah i Tasul, when they would leave behind them the minor tributaries to the Kharzan su, (anc. Arsanius,) but only to arrive, after another ascent and descent, at the river Bakiyah or of Bitlis, the greatest of the easterly tributaries to the Tigris. So that Xenophon could hardly be expected to have made the mistake regarding the passing the sources of the Tigris, besides that the distance given from his passing the headwaters of the Tigris, to the river Teleboas, much exceeds the distance of the Darah-i-Tasul from the Bakiyah river. Lastly, the Teleboas was a small river with many villages on its banks, the Bakiyah is not large, but is so goodly a stream, that the historian would not have gone out of his way to describe it as small, nor is it a district in which (except at Bitlis) many villages probably ever existed. All these circumstances taken into consideration leave no doubt that the Greeks ascended directly towards the great chain of the Ali Tagh, the ancient Niphates, in a direclion nearly north; by which proceeding, a journey of thirty miles would have carried them beyond the head-waters of the tributaries to the Tigris, in those districts, and another forty-five miles would have brought them into the valley of the Kara-su, recognised by many as the Teleboas of our author, and situate in the district of Moxoene, the present Mush,—apparently from the most remote times the seat of numerous towns and villages, and having a large population. That this is the only version that can be given to this

<pb n="318"/>
portion of the narrative, is further corroborated by the fact that from the Teleboas they proceeded through a plain which would not apply itself to the river Bakiyeh, (nor to the river of Bitlis,) both of which are enclosed in deep and wooded mountain valleys.”</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney's view of the subject is as follows. “ It is considered to be a journey of thirty-eight hours from Se'rt to Mush by the shortest route, (see Colonel Sheil's Journey from Tabriz through Kurdistan, Jour. of Roy. Geo. Soc. vol. viii. p. 77,) but as the Greeks approached the source of the Tigris, theirs must have been rather longer. About twenty hours would be consumed on their march to the high ground in question; and about twenty hours more in reaching the supposed Teleboas or Kara-su at the village of Arisban near Mush.”</p>
<p>This is the most satisfactory explanation of all, because by crossing the Niphates to Mush instead of to the valley of the Kara su at the foot of the Nimrud Tagh, the Greeks would have had the advantage of the high-way from Hazu to Mush. It may also be observed here, that had the Greeks intended keeping to the country of the <unclear>Kardnchians</unclear>, and passing the mountains by Bitlis, they need not have fought their way over the Centrites; and Xenophon, when he speaks of passing above Tigris, was, there is every reason to believe, well enough aware that he was crossing the great watershed. The historian also distinguishes the country they had advanced into as a different region of Armenia, under its own satrap.</p>
<p>In the face of all these facts, Layard says, " Six marches, of five parasangs each, brought them to the small river Teleboas. I am convinced that this river cannot be identified with the Kara su, which would be at least between forty and fifty parasangs, or from eight to ten days' march, from Tilleh, supposing Xenophon to have made the smallest possible deviation to the west." (This is supposing the Greeks to have started from Tilleh, which is not probable, and then to have travelled to the Kara su by way of Bitlis, which is left out of the consideration.) “ I believe," continues Layard, “ the Teleboas to have been the river of Bitlis. After crossing the low country of Kharzan, well described by Xenophon as
'a plain varied by hills of an easy ascent,' the Greeks must necessarily have turned slightly to the eastward to reach the Bitlis valley, as inaccessible mountains stopped all further progress." This is not the case; Colonel Sheil, as before quoted, describes a road from Sa'art of thirty-eight hours to Mush direct, which does not pass through Bitlis : and the Colonel adds, " this must be the road which Macdonald Kinneir supposes the Ten Thousand to have taken after they crossed the river, which he calls the Khabur, <unclear>nt</unclear> Se'rt." (Op. cit. p. 77.) Viscount Pollington passed through the Niphates on his journey from Erzrum to Aleppo in 1838; and Mr Consul Brant did the same on his journey from Kharput by Mush to Bitlis. This was by the valley of the Kolb <unclear>su</unclear>, (Handle water,) but Mr. Brant says there was another road crossing the</p>

<pb n="319"/>

<p>Immediately south of Mush. (See Journ. of Roy. Geog. Soc. vol. n. p. 445 et seq. and p. 352 et seq.) Either of those roads would have been preferable to the mountain route through Kurdistan b) Bitlis, to the Greeks.</p>
<p>Mr. Layard remarks, that the text of Xenophon describes the Greeks as coming to, not crossing, the Teleboas. This would apply itself alike to the origin of the Kara-su at the foot of the Nimrud Tagh—to the rivulet of Mush or Ak su—the White Water-a tributary to the Kara-su, or to the rivulet at Kizil Aghaz on the north side of the Kolb Tagh. It would scarcely apply to the rivet of Bitlis, with which they would have had to keep company some time. Beyond either of the above rivers there are plains, not so at the head of the Bitlis river, and all these rivers are beyond the water-shed of the Tigris, which is not the case with the river of Bitlis.</p>
<p>PALACE OF TIRIBAZUS.—The Greeks proceeded from the Teleboas three days' march, a distance of five parasangs, through a plain, till they came to a palace, with several villages around it, stored with abundance of provisions. The direction followed by the Greeks, after reaching the plains of Armenia, must be chiefly judged of by the time spent before they crossed the Euphrates. Had they pursued a direct northerly course, they could have reached the river in a day's march, but at a point where it is scarcely fordable. Probably they were informed of this fact, and hence led to pursue a north-easterly course to where the river was sufficiently fordable, and which was not attained till the sources of the river lire described as being not far off.</p>
<p>The palace of Tiribazus and surrounding villages may, from the distance given, be at or near the sites of Perak or Lis, north of Lake Nazuk, but this, in the absence of corroborative information, is naturally a merely speculative suggestion.</p>
<p>The plain of Mush attains an average elevation, from my own observations, of 4200 ft. above the sea, which is some 1800 ft. below that of Arzrum, vulgo Erzrum, Erzerum, and Erzeroom.* But between the two, or the valleys of the western Euphrates and that of the Murad su, the generality of the valleys and uplands which attain their culminating point in the Bin gill Tagh—the mountain of a thousand lakes—the Abus of the Romans—and on which are patches of perpetual snow, art much higher.</p>
<p>The knowledge which we now possess of the great elevation of these Armenian uplands explains the extreme severity of the winters, which has been the subject of much controversy; so much so, that Tournefort, the traveller and botanist, suggested that it might be owing to so unnatural a cause as the impregnation of the soil
<note type="footnote"> * Oriental manuscripts leave no doubt as to the name of the present capital of Armenia being Arzrum, vulgarly pronounced Erzerum. The importance of the prefix justify us in writing the word as it is spelt, not as it is pronounced. </note>

<pb n="320"/>
with sal-ammoniac. Positive elevation, in which the immediate relulls of a lower temperature are increased by a continental climate, and a long continuity of open woodless tracts, appear to be the main causes of the phenomena in question.</p>
<p>The Hon. Mr. Curzon, who spent the winter of 1842-43 at Arzrum, speaking of the intense cold experienced at that city, the present capital of Armenia, says, “ During great part of the year. and naturally in the winter, the cold was so severe that any one standing still for even a very short time, was frozen to death. Dead frozen bodies were frequently brought into the city; and it is common in the summer, on the melting of the snow, to find numerous corpses of men and bodies of horses, who had perished in the preceding winter. So usual an event is this, that there is a custom, or law, in the mountains of Armenia, that every summer the villagers go out to the more dangerous passes and bury the dead whom they are sure to find." (Armenia, <unclear/>&amp;c. p. 162.) This will give some idea of what the Greeks had to suffer during a winter ionrney across the uplands of Armenia.</p>
<p>FORD OF THE EUPHRATES.—From these villages an attack was made upon Tiribazus, who held a pass that lay on their way, after which the whole body set forward through deep snow, and travelled three days' journey, through a desert tract of country, a distance of fifteen parasangs, to the river Euphrates, which they passed without being wet higher than the middle. “ The sources of the river were said to be not far off.”</p>
<p>Rennell and Kinneir had both remarked that this distance is too great for troops marching through deep snow. All the probabilities of the case are, however, that the Greeks crossed the Murad su above its confluence with the Char Buhar su, and the river of Khanus or Kalah su, as beyond those points there would be so much the less water.</p>
<p>Layard having taken the Greeks through Karduchia to Bitlis, says, “ the high road from Bitlis to Northern Armenia would lead in exactly thirty hours, or six marches, to the Euphrates, which it crosses near Karaghal. I believe, therefore, that, after issuing from the valley of Bitlis, Xenophon turned to the westward, leaving the lake of Wan a little to the right, though completely concealed from him by a range of low hills. Skirting the western foot of the Nimroud Dagh range, he passed through a plain thickly inhabited, abounding in well-provisioned villages, and crossed here by ranges of hills. The country still tallies precisely with Xenophon's description." The upper valley of the Kara-su here alluded to, certainly abounds in villages, but I saw no ranges of hills actually crossing it. It is, however, commanded by low hills where it takes a westerly turn.</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney (ii. 229) says, " Agreeably to the intention of fording the great rivers towards their sources, (previously expressed. Anab. iv. l,) the Greeks would necessarily procced from the Tele

boas in a north-eastern direction, through a very mountainous tract, till they could cross the Murad Chai: this could not have been the case before they reached 39° 10' north latitude, or somewhere about seventy miles from the Kara su, which, under existing circumstances, would require the seven marches given by Xenophon.</p>

<p>This would identify the place where the Greeks forded the Murad su with a position not far beyond the junction of the river of Khanus or the Kalah-su; as would indeed be deduced from the general facts of the case.</p>
<p>TRIBUTARIES TO THE EUPHRATES.—From the Euphrates they advanced three days' march, through much snow and a level plain, a distance of fifteen parasangs: the third day's march was extremely troublesome, as the north wind blew full in their faces. The depth of the snow was a fathom; so that many of the baggage-cattle and slaves perished, with about thirty of the soldiers. There was plenty of wood at the encampment, which would indicate that they had reached the banks of a river, as it is almost only in such situations that wood is found in this part of Armenia. The valley most probably of one of the tributaries to the river of Khanus, or, if farther east, a tributary to the Murad su, on the plain of Arishkart. If in a westerly direction, the distances would lead them to the upper valley of the Kalah su or river of Khanus. In all these instances a northerly wind would still have blown more or less in their faces.</p>
<p>VILLAGES IN KHANUS DISTRIcT.-From thence they made one day's irregular march through the snow, the men affected with bulimia, snow-blindness, and mortification of the toes. Five or six geographic miles are as much as can be allowed for such a march: and at dark they arrived at a village with a rampart. The satrap residing a parasang off, very possibly at Khanus Kalahsi, which is apart from the villages. A Thermal spring, it is to be noted, was met with on this day's march. Xenophon with the rear did not get up to the villages till the next day. The description of the houses of the Armenians corresponds with what is observed in the present day, they are in part subterranean, and the live stock herd with the people during these severe winters. As these Armenians had laid in their stores for the winter, the Greeks found plenty of provisions, including barley-wine, and even grape-wine, in these villages.</p>
<p>Professor Maiden rather sharply criticises this identification of Khanus with the villages in question, adopted by.Rennell also long previously, but on different grounds. “ There is absolutely nothing," he says, “ according to Air. Ainsworth's notion of the route, but the existence of villages round the modern castle of Khanus, to identify that district with the group of villages where the Greeks rested a week; for Mr. Ainsworth goes beyond his author, when
<note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note>

<note type="footnote"> y </note>

<pb n="322"/>
he speaks of ‘ the palace of the satrap,' and would fain suppose the modern castle to be on the same site.”—The impression I received and still retain, however, is that the women and girls at the fountain, when the Greeks told them that they were going to the satrap, answered by informing them, that he was about a parasang off, meaning thereby, not that he and his army were hovering at that distance, but that his residence was there; and having read of the palace of the satrap Orontes and of that of Tiribazus a few pages before, I pictured to myself a palace or castle for the satrap of the Khanus district, more especially since the chief of that district dwells in a feudal castle to the present day.</p>
<p>In identifications like these, the traveller often differs from the cabinet geographer or scholar, inasmuch as his identifications are not only founded upon what exists, but that he has also in his mind at the same time what he does not enter into at length, a mass of negative matter as to what does not exist. The mere bare results thus presented often do not satisfy the critic upon the grounds given. When he doubts or condemns an identification, however, upon such grounds he does not take sufficiently into consideration, that the territory perhaps presents no other resources. Thus, for example, in the present instance, it is quite possible that the Greeks held on a due northerly course. I by no means wish to insist upon the point that they did not do so, as the north wind blew in their faces, and they would, in such a case, reach the upper and watered valleys of the Tag Tagh.</p>
<p>But what has been omitted to be explained in the “Travels in the Track," is that these upper valleys of the Bin Gill Tagh, and Tag Tagh, are utterly unproductive, except of a little short grass, and a narrow fringe or belt of low wood on the banks of the rivulets. They are neither cultivated nor inhabited.</p>
<p>It seems much more likely, therefore, that the Greeks found villages and cultivation, and heard of a satrap's residence, where there are in the present day villages and a chieftain’s residence, than that they found such higher up the country, where there are none such nor traces of such to be met with, nor a possible cultivation to induce the natives to settle at such a point.</p>
<p>THE ARAS.—After stopping eight days at these villages, the Greeks started under guidance of a native, who, leading them three days' marches without coming to any villages, so irritated Cheirisophus that he struck him, which was the occasion of his running away in the night. From what follows in the account of their journey, it appears that during these three days the Greeks turned the Tag Tagh, an easterly spur of the Bin Gül Tagh, and reached the tributaries of the Aras. This they would do travelling from fifteen to twenty geographic miles in the three days. The <unclear>Bin</unclear> Giil Tagh, one of the remarkable mountains of Central Armenia, gives birth to the south, to tributaries to the Murad su, to the west

<pb n="323"/>
and north-west, to the tributaries to the Western Euphrates, and to the north and north-east, to tributaries to the Aras.</p>
<p>River Phasin or ARAXES.—After losing the guide, the Greeks are described as proceeding seven days' journey, five parasangs each day, along the river Phasis. I am indebted for this important correction of all previous versions to Professor Maiden, who has published it in the 7th number of the Classical Museum, April,
1845, p. 36 et seq. There is, the Professor states, no real ambiguity in the meaning of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρά</foreign> in such a context. The meaning is the same as in v.10. 1, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔπλεον ήμέρας δύο παρα την γη̃ν</foreign>, " they sailed two days along the coast."</p>
<p>This being admitted, then, it will be observed that Xenophon, who mistook the Aras for the Colehian Phasis, describes it as only a plethrum, or a hundred feet, broad, where they joined it. This would show that it was not far from its sources. With such an indefinite point to start from, and a very uncertain value of the parasang in a journey through snow, it is difficult to measure off
35 parasangs on the map. Allowing, however, two geog. miles to the parasang, the utmost that can be done under the circumstances,
70 miles laid down on the map to illustrate the routes by Mr. Ainsworth, Mr. Suter, Mr. Brant, and Lord Pollington, published in the 10th volume of the Journ. of the Roy. Geog. Soc., would carry the Greeks to the junction of the Karu su, or river of Oran, with the Aras.</p>
<p>Professor Malden has conjectured, that having mistaken the Araxes for the Phasis, they followed the course of the stream, in the hope that it would lead them towards the Euxine, till, seeing that it continued to flow eastward, they resolved to try a somewhat more direct line. Now, nothing would have so aroused the Greeks to a sense of the mistake they were labouring under so much as coming to a large river flowing into the Aras from the north, at the very same time that the supposed Phasis took a bend rather to the south of east. Nothing would be left for them in their despair but (having crossed the Aras at its head) to turn away from it and follow the course of the new river they had come to northwards towards its sources. The distances granted are, however, very great, and the very same reflections may have forced themselves upon them at the very first stream they came to which flowed from the north-the river of Hassan Kalah. This would give a distance of fifty miles direct, and upwards of seventy miles by river from the point at which Mr. Brant and myself crossed the Aras. That river is already at that point fifty to sixty yards in width, the current rapid, the water reaching above the horse's girths. See Brant's Journal (Journ. of Roy. Geog. Soc. vol. x. p
344). If the Greeks passed it to the westward of this, then (which if, not likely, as the Bin Gill Tagh presented an impediment to so
<note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note>

<pb n="324"/>
doing) the chances of their not having got beyond the junction of the Hassan Kalah tributary, is still further increased.</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney's view of this portion of the retreat is as follows
(ii. 229):</p>
<p>"From hence, (the Murad su,) in a north-western direction, to a point where the river Aras, or Phasis of Xenophon, is generally fordable, namely, at the junction of the Hassan Kalah su and the Bin Gül su, near Kupri Kiui, (Bridge village,) it cannot be less than from seventy to eighty miles; since the shorter distance from the latter point to the upper part of the Murad su, near Kara Kilisa,
(Black or ruined Church,) is sixty-six miles."</p>
<p>"It has just been seen, that the distance in question occupied thirteen marches, or, including four days not particularly mentioned, about sixty-nine parasangs. But, as it is to be observed that these were intended to be road distances answering to one hour, it may fairly be presumed, that an army could not accomplish much more than about one mile in each, especially through snow so deep that the whole of the specified time must have been consumed between the rivers Euphrates and Araxes; even the pressing marches through Mesopotamia were less than two miles per hour. We are told, that it even became necessary to tie bags stuffed with hay to the horses'feet to prevent their sinking." It is obvious, that if we admit such a judicious estimate of the value of the parasang, under the described circumstances, that the difficulties of explaining the marches between the Euphrates and the Black Sea will be considerably diminished, and that the Greeks, notwithstanding their seven days' journey along the Aras, as established by Professor Malden, may in reality have only travelled some thirty-five miles along that river, and not beyond the first westerly—not northerly—affluent, the river of Hassan Kalahsi. The point at which that river joins the Aras is thirty miles by map from where Mr. Brant and myself crossed the Aras, but it would be a good thirty-five or more by the river.</p>
<p>PASS OF TilE TAOCHI.—Quitting, it is to be supposed, the Aras, the Greeks advanced two days' journey, ten parasangs; when on the pass that led over the mountains into the plain, the Chalybes, Tnochi, and Phasians were drawn up to oppose their progress.* As soon as they had gained this pass, and had sacrificed and erected a trophy, they went down into the plain before them, and arrived at a number of villages stored with abundance of excellent provisions. These villages would apparently be situated in the valley of Kara Oran or Kara Osman, which is watered by the
<note type="footnote"> * It is to be supposed that these ten miles were performed over the rocky districts between Kupri Kiui and Khorasan. Hamilton describes the road as, after leaving Kupri Kiui, being soon confined to a narrow pass between high hills on the left and the river on the right. (i. p. 185.) </note>

<pb n="325"/>
Kara su. Kara Oran ought possibly to be read Kara Wiran, "Black Ruin."</p>
<p>MOUNTAIN STRONG-HOLD OF THE TAOCHIANS. — From hence they marched five days' journey, thirty parasangs, to the country of the Taochi, where provisions beginning to fail them, they attacked one of the fastnesses, which is described as containing no houses, but defended by high rocks, down which the Taochians tolled great stones.</p>
<p>Supposing the country of the Taochians to correspond to that which is in part occupied by the Suwanli or Sughanli Tagh, if the parasang did not amount to more than a mile, in a difficult and hostile country, this journey would have only conducted the Greeks to the head waters of the river of Bardes. The forest range of the Suwanli 'agii is described by Hamilton as constituting an important and interesting feature in the geography of that part of the country, being the only district in which forests of any extent are to be found for many miles round, and its passage by Bardes and Gushlah is full of natural obstacles.</p>
<p>It is to be observed that traces of the name of Taochi are supposed to be found in the Tauk or Taok of the Turks, and Tuchi or Taoutchie of the Georgian districts. These people and those of the little Kabarda are said by Captain Stoltzman, as quoted by Colonel Chesney, to still retire occasionally into wattled enclosures.</p>

<p>COUNTRY OF THE CHALYBES.—Hence they advanced, seven days' journey, a distance of fifty parasangs, through the country of the Chalybes, who had their dwellings in strong places, in which they had also laid up their provisions, so that the Greeks could get nothing from that country, but lived upon the cattle which they had taken from the Taochi.</p>
<p>The distance from the head waters of the river ofBardes to the main tributary to the Arpa chai, is as the crow flies some forty miles, but by following the road to Kars, as the great road does in the present day, and crossing the mountains from liars to the Arpa chai at Kizil Chak Chak, it would be upwards of fifty miles
—a fair allowance for the fifty parasangs under the circumstances described in the text.</p>
<p>RIVER HARPASUS.—The Greeks next arrived at the river Harpasus, the breadth of which was four plethra. Supposing the modern Arpa chai to represent the Harpasus, we have shown, that the point where the Greeks would be expected to touch that river, by the distances given, would be at or where the present high road from Arzrum and Kars to Ardahan and Ahkiskah crosses it at Kizil Chak Chak. It must be already a goodly river at such a place, but there are no data for giving it a width of four hundred feet. So much obscurity indeed pervades this part of the route, that I am much inclined to doubt the correctness of the identifica.

<pb n="326"/>
tion of the Harpasus of Xenophon with the modern Arpa chai, and with Colonel Chesney and Layard to consider that the historian applied that name to the river now called the Juruk su or l'choruk su, and which was called in later times the Apsarus and Acampsis. The Juruk in the lower part of its course would present a width fully of four hundred feet.</p>
<p>COUNTRY OF THE SCYTHINI.—Hence they proceeded through the territory of the Scythini, four days' journey, making twenty parasangs, over a level tract, until they came to some villages, in which they halted three days, and collected provisions.</p>
<p>The distance here given, allowing about It mile for the parasang, would carry the Greeks up the valley of the Arpa chai across the watershed of that river, and down the valley of the river of Olti, a tributary to the Juruk su, to about the site of Olti itself. Or it is possible that they may have crossed the country that intervenes between the river of Olti and the Araxes in a more direct line to the Juruk su, nearly touching Hamilton's route, at the head waters of the rivers of Narman, Liefgaff, Turtum, and Yani Kiui, a line of country which Hamilton's, and still more lately Mr. Curzon's, descriptions show to be wooded, rocky, precipitous, and most difficult.</p>
<p>CITY OF GYMNIAS.—From this place they advanced four days' journey, twenty parasangs, to a large, rich, and populous city, called Gymnias, from which the governor of the country sent the Greeks a guide, to conduct them through a region at war with the people.</p>
<p>The distance given of twenty parasangs, allowing l½ mile per parasang, would carry the Greeks along the valley of the Olti river and up that of the Juruk su to Ispir or Ispira, a town of great antiquity, described at length by Hamilton in his Researches (vol. i. p. 219 et seq.).</p>
<p>It is to be observed also, that supposing Mount Theches to correspond to Tekiya Tagh, it is about sixty miles thence to Ispir, following the valley of the Juruk su; this in five days would give an average of twelve miles a day, which the Greeks may well be supposed to have got over in a route that did not present so many difficulties as usual.</p>
<p>It is evident, however, that it will require further corroborative testimony before Gymnias can be admitted to be the same as the modem Ispir.</p>
<p>MOUNT THECHES.—On the fifth day from Gymnias, distances not given, they came to a mountain, the name of which was Theches, and whence, to their great delight, the Greeks saw the sea.</p>
<p>The distance allowed between Mount Theches and the country of the Macrones, which in such a country did not much exceel twenty miles, places Mount Theehes between the Juruk su, the river of Baiburt, and the Kurash Tagh. It is in the present day called Takiya Tagh, which may be a corruption of Theches. OY

<pb n="327"/>
Theches of it, or it may simply mean the mountain of the monastery. This is the name also given to it by Hamilton, who adds a sketch of a remarkable mountain castle near Takiya. Mr. Vivien de St. Martin calls the mountain in his map Hak Mesdjidy Tagh. This name, like that of Takiya, refers to some holy edifice existing at the spot, and indicates that tradition has preserved the character imputed to the mountain by Xenophon down to existing times.</p>
<p>COUNTRY OF THE MACRONES. — From Mount Theches the Greeks advanced three days' journey, a distance of ten parasangs, through the country of the Macrones. On the first day they came to a river which divided the territory of the Macrones from that of the Scythini. On their right they had an eminence extremely difficult of access, and on their left another river, into which the boundary river which they had to cross emptied itself.</p>
<p>Allowing l½ geo. miles to the parasang in this difficult country, the country of the Macrones would correspond to the mountain land that lies between Gumush Khana or the silver mines, and the Kara Darah su, the Hyssus of Arrian's Periplus. This mountain is called Korash Tagh in Brant's map of 1836. The river to which they came would appear to correspond with the river beyond Kalah Kiui, or castle village, one of the head tributaries of the Kharshut river, or river of Gumush Khana, into which the river of Kalah Kiui itself flows from the left. As the Greeks crossed the boundary river above its junction with the river to the left, this very fact of its being in such a direction shows that it must have been a stream flowing westward, and not eastward. Had it had an easterly flow, and yet been to the left hand, it must have joined the boundary river before the Greeks crossed it.</p>
<p>COUNTRY OF TilE COLCHIANS.—The Macrones conducted the Greeks through their country for three days, until they brought them to the confines of the Colchians. At this point there was a range of hills high, but accessible, and upon them the Colchians were drawn up in array. Having passed the summit, the Greeks encamped in a number of villages containing abundance of provisions.</p>

<p>These villages, from the distance travelled the next day to Trebizond, manifestly correspond with the Greek villages which occupy at the present day the head of the valley, whence a very precipitous road leads down from the Kohat or Kolat Tagh (quaere Kulak Tagh, mountain of the pass) of Brant's map, (Journ. of Roy. Geo Soc. vol. vi.,) and the Kara Kaban of Hamilton, and which appeart to have been the range on which the Colchians had posted themselves.</p>

<p>The rivulet in question is called Surmel in Hamilton's map, where one of the villages is marked as Jivislik. (Kara Kapan and Djevisak of St. Martin's map.) It is recorded in my own notes

<pb n="328"/>
as Muhurjï-wooded valley with Greek villages, and a bridge over rivulet, at the foot of the Kara Kapan.</p>
<p>TREBIZOND.—From the villages of the Colchians, the Greeks proceeded two days' march, seven parasangs, and arrived at Trebizond, a Greek city of large population, on the Euxine Sea; a colony of Sinope, but lying in the territory of the Colchians. Here they stayed thirty days, encamping in the villages of the Colchians.</p>
<p>It is obvious that, in sketching out a possible line of travel through the countries of the Taochians, Chalybes, Scythians, Macronians, and Colchians, a region as yet little investigated, that other explanations might be admitted. One of these is, that the Greeks took a more central line, between the Aras and the Juruk su. This is not at all improbable. Hamilton explored this country from Bardes to Ispira, and found it so mountainous and difficult, as to fully account for a very great lapse of time in traversing it in almost a direct line. The difficulty that would remain to account for here, would be the account given of the Greeks having arrived at the Harpasns where it was four plethra in breadth. But may not this have been the Bardes su or the river of Narman, or some other river, not yet correctly delineated on the maps in the interval between the Juruk su, the Aras, the Olti river, and the river of Kars ? Colonel Chesney is with a still greater degree of probability inclined to identify the Harpasus with the Juruk su or Tchoruk su—variously designated as the Apsarus and Acampsis by the Romans.</p>
<p>Upon the subject of the prolonged marches made by the Greeks between the Aras and the Euxine, Colonel Chesney offers the following general explanations.</p>
<p>"On the second day after crossing the latter river, (the Araxes,) which Colonel Chesney supposes to have been crossed, as previously observed, near Kupri Kiui, the Greeks discovered the inhabitants of the surrounding countries, namely, the Chalybeans, the Taochians, and the Phasians, assembled to dispute their passage, and occupying strong ground, probably between the territory of the two last.</p>
<p>Here, as when difficulties of the same kind previously occurred, the eminences were gained by an attack made in the flank by volunteers; and the disheartened defenders having fled with loss, the Greeks got possession of some well-stored villages in advance.</p>
<p>During the succeeding five marches of thirty parasangs, made through the territory of the Taochians, provisions were scarce, it being the custom of the country people to place their supplies in secret fastnesses, probably wattled enclosures, such as those still in use in the Little Kabarda, and district of Tuchi. One of these intrenchments, containing a number of oxen, asses, and sheep, was, however, taken after a prolonged resistance; during which the

<pb n="329"/>
women chose to perish rather than fall into the power of the Greeks.</p>
<p>The latter now proceeded a distance of fifty parasangs through the territory of the Chalybeans to the river Harpasus, which they accomplished in seven marches; notwithstanding the dime ilties caused by the most warlike and the most troublesome people hitherto encountered. The system of hostilities pursued chiefly consisted in constantly harassing the rear; but when pressed in turn, they retreated to fastnesses in which their provisions were secured: so that the Greeks would have been starved by their systematic and persevering opposition, had it not been for the supply of cattle taken from the Taochians.</p>
<p>The difficulties experienced by Rennell, Ainsworth, and other commentators in following this part of the retreat of the Ten Thousand, will be greatly lessened if it be borne in mind, that the daily marches, through deep snow in January, the army being also harassed by the Chalybeans, must have been very short. From the supposed crossing-place on the Aras, keeping a little way northward of the direct line, it is about 110 miles to the Tchoruk su (Juruk su) or Acampsis, near Kara Aghatch, which would coincide with the fourteen marches given by Xenophon, as docs also the position of the river in question with the Harpasus; the last seven marches being, as we are informed, through the country of the Chalybeans, the Chaldeans of Strabo (xii. 549).</p>
<p>This probably was the southern part of the district of Tchildir; for the Chaldeans, as a separate people, occupied a tract next to the Colchians, which was, however, afterwards extended to Pontus, and formed a considerable kingdom under Mithridates.</p>
<p>Quitting the river Harpasus, twenty parasangs, made in four marches, brought the Greeks to a halting-place at some villages, possibly near the present town of Baiburt, in which they remained three days to obtain provisions. From hence, apparently proceeding towards the western pass through the great northern chain, they made twenty parasangs in three additional marches, to the rich and well-inhabited city of Gymnias. Possibly this place may now be represented by the small town of Gemeri on the Kara su, an affluent of the river Frat; in which case the distance thither, being about 60 miles, would occupy seven or eight marches along the slope of the Paryadres, a branch of the Taurus, or, as it is stated, through the country of the Scythinians. This appears to be the only trace of that ephemeral power, which commenced with the Sacae or Scythians, on the banks of the Araxes; from whence the people extended their name and authority over Imiretia, Colchis, Georgia, the Caucasus, Media, Persia, and even Palestine; according to Herodotus, the same people ruled Asia during twentyeight years.</p>
<p>On leaving Gymnias, the guide furnished by the satrap of the

<pb n="330"/>
district delighted the Greeks by saying that he would forfeit his head if he did not show them the sea in five marches; and accordingly on the fifth day, in ascending the holy mountain of Thedies, the Greeks gave a tremendous shout of surprise and delight, on finding his promise realized. The mountain alluded to may be the present Gaur Tagh; (from the summit of which Colonel Chesney saw the sea in 1831;) and from thence to Tarabuzun, although the direct distance is not great, the journey occupied five days with good horses. This was owing to the necessity of passing along what in reality is more a winding chasm than a mountain valley in the ordinary acceptation of the word; and it is scarcely necessary to observe, that the marches through the mountains of Kurdistan and Armenia often must have presented difficulties and caused delays susceptible of the same kind of explanation.</p>
<p>Gaur Tagh is not, however, the only mountain in this part of the country from which the Euxine may be seen, for the guide informed the author that it was visible from three other peaks, namely, the Zigani mountain, two hours N. W. of Godol; again, with a more extensive view, from Fililein, two hours on the other side of Godol towards Gumish Khanah ; and, lastly, at the higher peak of Karagul, three hours southward of the latter.</p>
<p>The name of the first, " Infidel mountain," and its position with respect to Tarabazun, claim for it the honour of representing the holy Theches; the localities also appear to correspond to the deseription. Xenophon tells us that in the first day they came to a river separating the Macronians from the Scythinians; and on this, which disembogned into another river, the Macronians were drawn up to dispute the passage. A negotiation, followed by a treaty, produced, however, friendship with that people.</p>
<p>Eleven or twelve miles N. N. W. of Gaur Tagh (visible from thence) is the village of Damajula, which is situated near the meeting of four valleys and two rivers. One of the latter coming from the N. W. has remarkably steep banks, rising fifteen or twenty feet, with hills above, of difficult ascent on the eastern side, and a chain of more accessible shoulders on the opposite; both are covered with firs, and silver poplars of small size. This valley would have been met during the first day's march from Gaur Tagh, and troops posted on the opposite sides would be within speaking distance, although they must have been completely separated by the difficult nature of the ravine. Peace being concluded, the Greeks were conducted by this people during the succeeding three marches through the remainder of their territory; no doubt following the valleys of Damoulee and Godol, till at the termination of the latter, and about thirty-one miles from Damajula, they entered that of Gumush Khanah, a little northward of the town of this name.</p>
<p>The great and deep valley in question runs northward from

<pb n="331"/>
chence along the foot of the Colchian mountains for about twelve miles, where an abutment of the latter, called Karakaban, crosses it near Zigani, at an elevation of 5300 feet, and the pass thus formed was occupied in force by the Colchians.</p>
<p>Being in a state of hostility with the latter, the Macronians returned to their own country, a distance of about forty-three miles, which would correspond with the three marches made in a more favourable season (February) than the preceding part of the march. It is difficult to imagine a stronger barrier or a more formidable position than that which here presented itself, to exercise the talent and display the unshaken intrepidity of the Greek chief. Owing to the nature of the ground, as well as the numbers by which it was occupied, the Greeks, even could they have passed the latter unbroken, would have been out-flanked had they attacked in line. But Xenophon, without hesitation, turned this circumstance to his own advantage, by a master-piece of tactics hitherto unequalled.</p>
<p>The Greeks were formed in eleven columns, three of which, each consisting of GOO targeteers and archers, occupied the flanks and centre; these ascended the hill at such distances from one another that Xenophon not only outstretched the flanks of the Colchians, but was also prepared to attack them in rear, if, contrary to expectation, they had stood the shock and maintained their ground. At first the Colchians advanced, but before they closed with the Greek columns, they opened right and left, and eventually fled in disorder, abandoning the well-stored villages in their rear.</p>
<p>After three days' halt, suffering from the quantity and nature of the honey, which, from the abundance of the azalea pontica, the rhododendron ponticum, and the hellebore, in this fine country, affects the brain for a time, the Greeks, in two marches of seven parasangs, reached the villages near Tarabuzun (Trebizond).
(Vol. ii. p. 230 et seq.)</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney's explanation gains a manifest advantage in simplicity of detail over mine, by his not taking the Greeks out the way to reach the Arpa chai, Hamilton's Harpasus, but it loses it again by going out of the way to the westward to the Gaur Tagh, because the Colonel saw the sea from that point. It is evident that there must be many heights of the mountains east as well as west of the river of Gumush Khanah, from whence the sea can be discerned. In this part of the retreat, where probably the points will never be all definitively settled, that explanation which presents the greatest degree of simplicity, and at the same time meets most closely all the exigencies of the case, will be the one which will ultimately meet with the most general acceptance.</p>
<p>M. Vivien de Saint Martin, in his admirable Histoire des Decouvertes Gengraphiques, (tome ii. p. 324,) after identifying Gymnias

<pb n="332"/>
with a village called Djinnis, situated near the left bank of the Eu. phrates, about six leagues from Arzrum to the westward, says:</p>
<p>“The body of the Greeks having left Gymnias or Djinnis, on the Upper Euphrates, must have ascended the Kop Tagh, descended the Massa Deressi (Marsah Darahsi) or river of Baiburt, then re-ascended up the course of the river of Balakhor (Balak Hur, "Fish stream?") to the Takiya Tagh, where the name of Theches is still preserved. From thence they descended to the upper valley of the Balak Hur, which led them to the precipitous chain of the Kolat Tagh, evidently the same as the mountain of the Colchians of Xenophon; this chain separates the two watersheds, which pour their waters to the south in the Upper Tchoruk or river of Ispir, to the north directly to the Black Sea, towards the coast of Trebizond. The divers circumstances of the narrative do not appear to us to leave the least doubt upon this itinerary, of which nature has marked the features in an ineffaceable manner in this country of deeply contrasted configurations."</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary, but for fear of misconception it may be as well to remark that this identification of the Kolat Tagh with the mountain of the Colchians, upon the strength of the name, will not be received by scholars in this country.</p>
<p>Professor Malden, after recurring to the mistake made by Major Rennell, Kinneir, and myself, in supposing that the Greeks marched seven days after the guide ran away from them before they reached the Phasis; adds,</p>
<p>“Rennell, however, has probably fallen into a further mistake in thinking that the Greeks did not cross the Harpasus; for this seems to be his opinion. He supposes that they came to the river between its conflux with the Araxes and the conflux of the river of Kars with the other streams that form it, and then turned back from it towards the west; so that their subsequent marches for four days were still between the Harpasus and the Phasis or Araxes; and he is inclined to identify the city of Gymnias with a modern town on the latter river. Xenophon certainly does not say distinctly that they crossed the Harpasus, but his language implies it. He says, ‘After this the Greeks arrived at the river Harpasus, which was four hundred feet broad. Thence they marched through the country of the Scythini,' &amp;c. (iv.7.18). He does not say that they did not cross it, and the notice of the breadth of the river is not much to the purpose unless they did cross it; and besides, he uses the very same language with respect to rivers which were certainly crossed. (See i. 4, §§ 9 and 19; and iv. 4, §§
3 and 7.)</p>
<p>" But, if they crossed it, it was probably the branch called the river of Kars which they crossed, not the stream below the junction of this branch with those to the east of it; otherwise, we should have them still persevering in their mistaken easterly course;

<pb n="333"/>
and they would have had to cross the eastern branch on their way back towards the west. In crossing the river of Kars they would be going northward; and if they then turned westward, they would fall in with no considerable river till they came to the Apsarus or Shoruk, (Juruk,) which accords with Xenophon's narrative; the Shoruk being identified with the river of the Macrones.</p>
<p>"After examining all the circumstances of the story, if we suppose the Greeks to have crossed the Phasis at the point which Rennell indicates, near the modern bridge of Koban Kupri, (same as Kupri Kiui,) or perhaps even nearer to its source; and then, in consequence of their confusion between the two rivers Phasis, to have turned eastward, and marched seven days along its northern bank, and even when they left the river to have inclined but little towards the north, and to have reached the Harpasus about the junction of the river of Kars with the other branches, thus traversing the diagonal of the space between the Araxes and the Arpa-su, we assign them a march, which in winter, through an unknown country, and in the presence of an active enemy, might well occupy the time given for it. The time is twenty-one days; and the distance from point to point in a straight line, if the Greeks had not kept to the river-side for the first seven days, would be about 120 miles. If we admit, therefore, a very reasonable account of deviation from the direct course, and allow that the length of the days' marches has either been over-rated by Xenophon, or exaggerated by errors of the transcribers, the difficulties seem to be removed.</p>
<p>"The problem which remains is to fix the position of the city of Gymnias north of the river of Kars." (The Classical Museum, No. vii. p. 41 et seq.)</p>
<p>The most superficial glance at the map published by the Roy. Geog. Soc. to illustrate routes of Mr. Ainsworth, Mr. Brant, Mr. Suter, and Lord Pollington, in the tenth volume of their Journal, would satisfy Professor Malden that it was along the Bin Giil su or Upper Aras, that the Greeks would have performed their seven days’ journey, and not on the Kalah su, which they joined at Kupri Kiui, where I suppose them to have terminated their seven days' march, having Professor Malden's correction in mind. I quite agree, however, with the Professor, that the correct determine ation of the position of Gymnias will do much towards elucidating this most abstruse part of the narrative, and the determination may yet be expected, from the constant progress that geographical and archaeological research are making in the East.</p>
<p>The question has, indeed, been much narrowed <unclear>in</unclear> its cOmpass already, from the day when Rennell conceived that the Greeks, having lost their way, wandered up and down after crossing the Araxes. A mere intimate acquaintance with the physical charae.

<pb n="334"/>
ters of northern Armenia has shown it to be a country peculiarly difficult to travel in-a constant succession of hills and valleysprecipices and ravines-rocky ledges and foaming torrents.</p>
<p>Air. Curzon, who has given a very picturesque account of some of the difficulties to be met with in travelling from Arzrum to Trebizond, in his little work on Armenia, mentions having met a rich Persian merchant on the 2nd of January, at a hovel called Khaderach Khan, who had been eighteen days on the road from Trebizond, which was thirty-two hours of Tartar posting. At the pass of Husha-Bunar he also came upon a party of Persians, seated on the ledge of a precipice, looking despairingly at a number of their baggage-horses which had tumbled over, and were wallowing in the snow many hundred feet below. At the Zigana Tagh, a whole caravan had been overwhelmed in an avalanche. When these difficulties come to be better appreciated, it will be easy to understand how the Greeks should, in the depth of winter and the natives in open hostility to them, have spent so much time in this part of the country.</p>
<p>“We have not," says Layard, “I conceive, sufficient data in Xenophon's narrative to identify with any degree of certainty his route after crossing the Euphrates. We know that about twenty parasangs from that river, the Greeks encamped near a hot spring, and this spring might be recognised in one of the many which abound in the country. It is most probable that the Greeks took the road still used by caravans through the plains of Hinnis (Khanus) and Hassan-Kalah, as offering the fewest difficulties. But what rivers are we to identify with the Phasis and Harpasus, the distance between the Euphrates and Phasis being seventy parasangs, and between the Phasis and Harpasus ninety-five, and the Harpasus being the larger of the two rivers? I cannot admit that the Greeks turned to the west and passed near the site of the modern Erzeroom. There are no rivers in that direction to answer the description of Xenophon. Moreover, the Greeks came to the high mountain, and beheld the sea for the first time, at the distance of thirty-two parasangs from Trebizond. Had they taken either of the three modern roads from Erzeroom to the coast, and there are no others, they must hive seen the Euxine in the immediate vicinity of Trebizond, certainly not more than six or eight parasangs from that city. I am, on the whole, inclined to believe, that either the Greeks took a very tortuous course after leaving the Euphrates, making daily but little actual progress towards the great end of their arduous journey, the sea-coast, or that there is a considerable error in the amount of parasangs given by Xenophon; that the Harpasus must be the Tcheronk, (Juruk,) and the Phasis, either the Araxes or the Kur; and that. Mount Theches, the holy mountain, from which the Greeks beheld the sea, was

<pb n="335"/>
between Batun and Trebizond, the army having followed the valley of the Tcherouk, but leaving it before reaching the site of the modern port on the Black Sea." (Nineveh and Babylon, p. 65.)</p>
<p>This is, at all events, an uncompromising statement of the obscurities that envelope this part of the retreat, if it is not a lucid record of the details. Colonel Chesney having seen the sea with his own eyes from the Gaur or Jawur Tagh, is an answer to one objection—that it could certainly not be seen at a greater distance than six or seven parasangs from Trebizond. With regard to other difficulties, Layard would throw the whole subject back again to the dark .period that preceded the investigations of Rennell and Kinneir. I have endeavoured to show what has been added to those able and conscientious researches, and the patience and zeal of future inquirers will, most assuredly, sift what is good from all these statements, will expunge that which will not stand the test of time, and will arrive ultimately at some clear and satisfactory conclusions regarding these very remarkable Armenian wanderings.</p>
<p>CERASUS.—The Greeks recruited themselves at Trebizond, till the supplies furnished by the surrounding country were nearly exhausted, and then, only a portion of the necessary shipping having been obtained, they embarked their women and children, with the sick and the aged, under the two oldest generals, Philesius and Sophaenetus, while the remainder proceeded by land; and in three marches they reached the Greek city Cerasus, or, more correctly, Kerasus. Hamilton has shown that the ancient Kerasus does not correspond with the modern Kirasunt, but that the site must besought for at the rivulet of Kirasun Darah su, about eight miles from Cape Yurus, and not quite forty from Trebizond. Considering the difficulties of the country, it is not likely, Colonel Chesney remarks, that a greater distance could have been accomplished in three days.</p>
<p>THE MOSSYNOECI.—The territory of the Mossynoeci or <unclear>Moschi</unclear>, in which the Greeks became engaged in a struggle that had nearly been disastrous to them, appears to have stretched from a little dislance westward of Trebizond, to the district of Pharnaeia, or upwards of seventy miles along the coast. The fort or citadel of these fierce people appears to have been in the neighbourhood of Cerasus. These Mossynoeci—the Mossyni of Pliny and of Pomponius Mela-and who are said to derive their name from the wooden turrets or the trees they dwelt in, are described as being the most barbarous people the Greeks met with during the whole of their journey.</p>
<p>THE CHALYBES.—The Greeks were eight days travelling through the territory of the Mossynoeci, after which they came to that of the Chalybes. These were subject to the Mossynoecians, and far from being numerous, they lived by the manufacture of iron, and were mixed with the Tibarenians. Hamilton found the poor

<pb n="336"/>
natives of the coast occupied in the present day in extracting iron from the superficial soil, not exactly at this spot, but to the west of Cotyora, and between the ruins of Polemonium and the Thermodon, directly south of Uniyah Kalah, ancient Oenoe.</p>
<p>COTYORA.—Marching through the country of the Tibareni, which is described as being more campaign, and the towns near the sea not so strong, the Greeks came to Cotyora, a Greek city, and a colony of Sinopians, situated in the territory of the Tibarenians. Cotyora was replaced by Pharnacia, which was built, according to Strabo, out of its spoils, and hence, in the time of Arrian, was already a mere village.</p>
<p>Hamilton has identified the site with a place called Ordu or Urdu, where are some remains of an ancient port, and Colonel Chesney has accepted the identification. There are some difficulties in the way of this identification with the distances given by Arrian in the Periplus of the Euxine Sea, which led me to prefer the site of Parshambah. It is, however, by no means a point to he insisted upon.</p>
<p>SINOPE.—After discussing the question of forming a Greek settlement on the Euxine, as well as the relative advantages of a homeward voyage by sea, and a march thither by land, the Greeks adopted the former course; and the Cotyorians having provided the necessary shipping to get rid of their uninvited guests, a fair wind carried the Greeks rapidly along the coast of Paphlagonia, when passing in succession the rivers Thermodon (Thirmah su), Iris (Yashil Irmak), and Halys (Kiz.il Irmak), they landed at Harmene or Armene, a port five miles from the flourishing city of Sinope, once a Milesian colony. The site of this port and city is too well known to require further illustration.</p>
<p>HERACLEA.-After electing Cheirisophus commander-in-chief, the Greeks sailed from Sinope along the coast of Paphlagonia and Bithynia, to Heraclea, where the army disembarked at the close of the second day's sail. Xenophon makes the Greeks pass the rivers Thermodon and Halys on this journey, by mistake; instead of on that from Cotyora to Sinope.</p>
<p>The Greeks came to an anchor near to the peninsula of the Acherusians-the site of one of Hercules’ fabled exploits. The modern town of Harakli occupies only the south-west corner of the space covered by the ancient city. The Lycus noticed by Xenophon is called the Kilij su or Sword river, significative of the same thing-its sudden wolf-like or destructive risings.</p>
<p>CALPE.-The Greeks, in their apparent great anxiety for booty
—an anxiety which attained its acme as they were getting near home, divided into three bodies. The Arcadians and the Achaeans, mustering about 4500 heavy-armed men, proceeded by sea to Calpe. while the other heavy-armed men and the Thracian targeteers, who amounted to about 2100 men under Cheirisophus, marched

<pb n="337"/>
along the coast to Thrace; Xenophon himself, at the head of 1700 heavy-armed men, 300 targeteers, and 40 horsemen, marching, according to Colonel Chesney, towards Calpe in a direct line. I read it, however, through the middle of the country, a phrase which is twice repeated in the account of the journey, and as the district that lies between the shore and the plains of Tuz-cha and Sabancha, is occupied by the Yailah Tagh, a densely wooded range of hills, totally impassable to a body of troops, there remained no alternative but to keep to the shore or to take to the middle of the country. My idea, as expressed in the “Travels in the Track," and which I am still inclined to hold by, is, that Xenophon, in the pursuit of booty,crossed the Yailah Tagh—ancient Mons Hypius,and descended upon the fertile plain of Prusa ad Hypium, but on nearing of the the straits in which his comrades were placed at Calpe, he returned thither through the westerly prolongation of the same hills. The promontory of Calpe enjoyed in those times the same name as that of Gibraltar. It is now called Kirpah or Kafkan Adasi.</p>
<p>CHRYSOPOLIS.—After a long stay and no small disasters entailed by the restlessness of the Greeks at Calpe, they started from that place, marching through Bithynia, or Asiatic Thrace, as it was also called, six days' march, to Chrysopolis—the Golden city, the modern Uskudar or Scutari, opposite to Constantinople. The dislance travelled upon this occasion by road of some eighty miles in six days, gives an average of thirteen miles a day, showing that eight, ten, and twelve were as often assumed ordinary day's journeys, under circumstances of greater difficulties, according to the exigencies of the case, and may indeed have been still less. The retreat of the Ten Thousand may in reality be said to end at this point, for the kind of business which they became engaged in after crossing the Bosphorus, has nothing to do with that on which they were originally taken from their homes by the ambition of Cyrus.</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand in European THRACE.—From Chrysopolis the Greeks crossed over to Byzantium, where they were but scurvily treated by the Lacedaemonian admiral Anaxibius, and hence obliged to quarter in some Thracian villages. Xenophon sailed in the mean time to Cyzicus, (now Baal Kiz,) from whence he returned to his comrades, and led them all, except such as remained with Neon and such as had disbanded on finding themselves in Europe, to Perinthus, now Haraldi. From this point they were induced by large promises to assist Seuthes, son of Maesades, to recover his patrimony as one of the independent kings of Thrace. In execution of this compact they marched into the country called the Delta of the Thracians, above Byzantium, that of the Melinophagi, who dwelt in the eastern part of the Kutchuk Balkhan,
(Little Balkhan,) and they arrived at Salmydissus or Kalmydissus, now Midiyah, on the Euxine. After they had subdued the
<note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note>

<note type="footnote"> z </note>

<pb n="338"/>
inhabitants, who lived chiefly by the plunder of wrecks, they returned and encamped on a plain above Selymbria.</p>
<p>The Greeks arrive at PERGAMUS.—At this point the Greeks parted from Seuthes, who had failed to fulfil his promises made to them, and crossing the Propontis, they repaired to Lampsacns, a well-known port on the Hellespont, now called Lamsaki. From hence they marched through Troas, and passing over the celebrated Mount Ida, they came first to Antandrus, now Antandros, <unclear>near</unclear> Adramiti. Hence they continued their march along the coast of the Lydian sea, to the plain of Thebes. It is known, from Herodotus and Livy, that the plain of Adramyttium was so called. Thence they passed through Adramyttium or Atramyttium Certonium, which is believed to be the Karene of Herodotus, and Atarne, an Aeolian city-the Atarneus of Strabo, from whence they reached Pergamus, where the narrative of the historian finally ceases.</p>
<p>The whole of the way, both of the Expedition and of the Retreat, is said to have comprised two hundred and fifteen days' march, of eleven hundred and fifty-five parasangs, and of thirty thousand six hundred and fifty stadia. and the time employed iD <unclear/> both. was a year and three months.</p>

Krüger supposes the passage in which this is mentioned, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραπλέοντ ες</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῡτον δὲ</foreign>, to be an interpolation, because the rivers named in connexion with it, the Thermodon, Iris, and Ilalys, do not run into the Euxine on that side of Sinope, but on the other, to the east of it.

<p>The two charges on which Socrates was condemned to death by the Athenians, sect. 1. The first charge refuted by several arguments: for Socrates used to sacrifice to the gods, 2; he practised divination, and his doemon was no new god, 2—5; he recommended that the gods should be consulted by man in perplexing circumstances, 6—9; he was guilty of no impiety, he avoided vain speculations respecting the gods, and said that the business of philosophy was the study of virtue, 10-17; his life was in accordance with the precepts of morality, 18-20.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>

<p>Socrates not only exhorted men to practise virtue, but led them to the practice of it; his dialogue with Aristodemus, sect. 1, 2. Things formed for a purpose, must be the production, not of chance, but of reason, 3, 4. The human frame is a structure of great excellence, and admirably fitted for its purposes; and we must therefore suppose that man is the object of divine forethought, 5—7. The order of things throughout the universe shows that it is under the providence of a superior nature, 8,9. The superiority of man over the inferior animals proves that he is more immediately under the care of the higher powers, 10—14. The gods also give instruction to man as to his conduct, 1,5. That they care for man both individually and collectively is evident from various considerations, 15, 16. As the mind governs the body, so the providence of the gods governs the world, 17. If men therefore worship the gods rightly, they may feel persuaded that the gods will be ready to aid them, 18, 19.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>

<p>Three dialogues of Socrates with Antipho. I. Antipho ridicules the poverty and frugality of Socrates, and his forbearance to receive pay for his instructions, sect. 1—3; Socrates replies that, by not receiving remuneration, he is more at liberty to choose his audience, 4, 5 ; that there are various advantages attendant on plainness of diet and dress, 6, 7; that the frugal man has the advantage over the man of pleasure in facilities for self-improvement, for doing his duty to his country, and for securing general happiness, 8—10. II. Antipho asserts that Socrates might be a Just man, but was by no means wise, in accepting no payment, 11, 12; Socrates replies that to sell wisdom is to degrade it, and that more good is gained by the acquisition of friends than of money, 13, 14. III. Antipho asks Socrates why, when he trained others to manage public affairs, he took no part in public affairs himself; Socrates replies that he was of more service to his country by training many to govern it, than he could have been by giving his single aid in the government of it, 15.</p>

<p>Socrates, suspecting that Aristippus, a man of pleasure, was aspiring to a place in the government, admonishes him that temperance is an essential qualification in a statesman, sect. 1—7. But as Aristippus says that ho looked only to a life of leisure and tranquil enjoyment, Socrates introduces the question, whether those who govern, or those who are governed, live the happier life, 8—10. Aristippus signifies that he wished neither to govern nor to be governed, but to enjoy liberty; and Socrates shows that such liberty as he desired is inconsistent with the nature of human society, 11—13. Aristippus still adhering to his own views, and declaring his intention not to remain in any one country, but to visit and sojourn in many, Socrates shows him the dangers of such a mode of life,
14—16. But as Aristippus proceeds to aceuse those of folly who prefer a life of toil in the affairs of government to a life of case, Socrates shows the difference between those who labour voluntarily, and those whe labour from compulsion, and observes that nothing good is given to mortals without labour, 17—20; in illustration of which remark he relates the fable of Prodicus, THE CHOICE OF HERCULES, 21—31.</p>

<p>Socrates, hearing that two brothers, Chaerephon and Chaerecrates, had quarrelled, recommends brotherly love to Chaerecrates by the following arguments. A brother ought to be regarded as a friend, and esteemed more than wealth, sect. 1; for wealth is an uncertain possession, if the possess or of it is destitute of friends, 2, 3. Fraternal love an appointment of Nature; and men who have brothers are more respected than those who have one, 4. Even though a brother should conceive ill feelings towards us, we should still endeavour to conciliate him, 5—9. How such conciliation may be effected, 10—14. The endeavour to conciliate is still more the duty of a younger than of an elder brother, and the more noble the disposition of a brother is, the more easy will it he to conciliate him,
15—17. Brothers should act in unison with one another, like different members of the same body, 18, 19.</p>

Madness is therefore ignorance of the virtues of justice, temperance, and fortitude; for prudence is manifested in the knowledge of these virtues. But the source, and foundation as it were of prudence, is the knowledge of one's self. He therefore that is destitute of this knowledge of himself is bordering on madness.

<p>ON the sense of the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπτύσσειν το κέρας</foreign>, Anab. i.10. 9. I might have expressed myself in the note with more decision. The meaning of the words is evidently similar to that of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπτύσσοντας
τὴν φάλαγγα</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπτυχθείσης τη̄ς φάλαγγος</foreign>, Cyrop. vii.5.3 and
5, where those expressions are fully explained by the context. A portion of the men were withdrawn from one or both wings of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάλαγξ</foreign>, or main body, and sent to the rear, making the line at once shorter and deeper. Thus the Greeks acted with regard to their wing; they either drew back the wing altogether, and formed it be-hind the main body, or drew back a portion of the men from the extremity of the wing, and formed them behind the front ranks of the wing, in order to make the wing itself deeper and more compact. I think the latter supposition, which confines <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπτὺσσειν</foreign> to <unclear/> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ κέρας</foreign>, the more probable. The Greeks " pu' the river in their rear " by wheeling round.</p>
<p>Of Professor Maiden's translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρἀ τὸν φᾱσιν ποταμόν</foreign>, "along the river Phasis," I was not aware, until I saw it mentioned by Mr. Ainsworth in his Commentary, p. 226, or I should have adopted it.</p>
<p>If the student should observe that the negative <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔκουν</foreign>, in Kühner's text of the Memorabilia, is, in some few passages, not translated negatively, he inst suppose that, in such cases, I thought a positive sense would be better Editors vary, in many places, in the accentuation of this word</p>
