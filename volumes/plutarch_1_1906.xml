            <title type="main">PREFACE.</title>
          </head>
          <p>No apologies are needed for a new edition of so favourite <lb/>
            an author as Plutarch. From the period of the revival <lb/>
            of classical literature in Europe down to our own times, <lb/>
            his writings have done more than those of any other <lb/>
            single author to familiarise us with the greatest men and <lb/>
            the greatest events of the ancient world.</p>
          <p>The great Duke of Marlborough, it is said, confessed <lb/>
            that his only knowledge of English history was derived <lb/>
            from Shakespeare's historical plays, and it would not be <lb/>
            too much to say that a very large proportion of educated <lb/>
            men, in our own as well as in Marlborough's times, have <lb/>
            owed much of their knowledge of classical antiquity to <lb/>
            the study of Plutarch's Lives. Other writers may be <lb/>
            read with profit, with admiration, and with interest; but <lb/>
            few, like Plutarch, can gossip pleasantly while instruct­ <lb/>
            ing solidly; can breathe life into the dry skeleton of <lb/>
            history, and show that the life of a Greek or Roman <lb/>
            worthy, when rightly dealt with, can prove as entertain­ <lb/>
            ing as a modern novel. No one is so well able as Plutarch <lb/>
            to dispel the doubt which all schoolboys feel as to whether <lb/>
            the names about which they read ever belonged to men <lb/>
            who were really alive; his characters are so intensely <lb/>
            human and lifelike in their faults and failings as well as <lb/>
            in their virtues, that we begin to think of them as of <lb/>
            people whom we have ourselves personally known.</p><pb n="vi"/>
            
          <p>His biographies are numerous and short. By this, he <lb/>
            avoids one of the greatest faults of modern biographers, <lb/>
            that namely of identifying himself with some one par­ <lb/>
            ticular personage, and endeavouring to prove that all his <lb/>
            actions were equally laudable. Light and shade are as <lb/>
            necessary to a character as to a picture, but a man who <lb/>
            devotes his energies for years to the study of any single <lb/>
            person's life, is insensibly led into palliating or explain­ <lb/>
            ing away his faults and exaggerating his excellencies <lb/>
            until at last he represents him as an impossible monster <lb/>
            of virtue. Another advantage which we obtain by his <lb/>
            method is that we are not given a complete chronicle of <lb/>
            each person's life, but only of the remarkable events in <lb/>
            it, and such incidents as will enable us to judge of his <lb/>
            character. This also avoids what is the dreariest part of <lb/>
            all modern biographies, those chapters I mean which <lb/>
            describe the slow decay of their hero's powers, his last <lb/>
            illness, and finally his death. This subject, which so <lb/>
            many writers of our own time seem to linger lovingly <lb/>
            upon, is dismissed by Plutarch in a few lines, unless any <lb/>
            circumstance of note attended the death of the person <lb/>
            described.</p>
          <p>Without denying that Plutarch is often inaccurate and <lb/>
            often diffuse; that his anecdotes are sometimes absurd, <lb/>
            and his metaphysical speculations not unfrequently ridi­ <lb/>
            culous, he is nevertheless generally admitted to be one of <lb/>
            the most readable authors of antiquity, while all agree <lb/>
            that his morality is of the purest and loftiest type.</p>
          <p>The first edition of the Greek text of Plutarch's Lives <lb/>
            appeared at Florence in the year 1517, and two years <lb/>
            afterwards it was republished by Aldus. Before this, <lb/>
            however, about the year 1470, a magnificent Latin version <lb/>
            by various hands appeared at Rome. From this, from <lb/>
            the Greek text, and also from certain MSS. to which he <lb/>
            had access, Amyot in the year 1559 composed his excellent <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            translation, of which it has been well said: " Quoique on <lb/>
            vieux Gaulois, elle a un air de fraicheur qui la fait rejeunir <lb/>
            de jour en jour."</p>
          <p>Amyot's spirited French version was no less spiritedly <lb/>
            translated by Sir Thomas North. His translation was <lb/>
            much read and admired in its day; a modern reviewer <lb/>
            even goes so far as to say that it is " still beyond compari­ <lb/>
            son the best version of Parallel Lives which the English <lb/>
            tongue affords." Be this as it may, the world will ever <lb/>
            be deeply indebted to North's translation, for it is to <lb/>
            Shakespeare's perusal of that work that we owe ' Corio­ <lb/>
            lanus,' * Antony and Cleopatra,' and ' Julius Caesar.'</p>
          <p>North's translation was followed by that known as <lb/>
            Dryden's. This work, performed by many different hands, <lb/>
            is of unequal merit. Some Lives are rendered into a racy <lb/>
            and idiomatic, although somewhat archaic English, while <lb/>
            others fall far short of the standard of Sir Thomas North's <lb/>
            work. Dryden's version has during the last few years <lb/>
            been re-edited by A. H. Clough, Fellow of Oriel College, <lb/>
            Oxford.</p>
          <p>The translation by which Plutarch is best known at <lb/>
            the present day is that of the Langhornes. Their style <lb/>
            is certainly dull and commonplace, and is in many <lb/>
            instances deserving of the harsh epithets which have been <lb/>
            lavished upon it. We must remember, however, before <lb/>
            unsparingly condemning their translation, that the taste <lb/>
            of the age for which they wrote differed materially from <lb/>
            that of our own, and that people who could read the <lb/>
            ‘ Letters of Theodosius and Constantia' with interest, <lb/>
            would certainly prefer Plutarch in the translation of the <lb/>
            Langhornes to the simpler phrases of North's or Dryden's <lb/>
            version. All events, comic or tragic, important or common­ <lb/>
            place, are described with the same inflated monotony <lb/>
            which was mistaken by them for the dignity of History. <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            Yet their work is in many cases far more correct as a <lb/>
            translation, and the author'is meaning is sometimes much <lb/>
            more clearly expressed, than in Dryden's earlier version. <lb/>
            Langhorne's Plutarch was re-edited by Archdeacon Wrang­ <lb/>
            ham in the year 1819.</p>
          <p>In 1844, thirteen Lives were translated by that eminent <lb/>
            scholar the late Mr. George Long; and it is by way of <lb/>
            complement to these Lives that the present version was <lb/>
            undertaken with his consent and his approval.</p>
          <p>Those translated by Mr. Long were selected by him as <lb/>
            illustrating a period of Roman history in which he was <lb/>
            especially interested, and will therefore be found to be <lb/>
            more fully annotated than the others. It has seemed to me <lb/>
            unnecessary to give information in the notes which can at <lb/>
            the present day be obtained in a more convenient form in <lb/>
            Dr. Smith's Classical Dictionary and Dictionary of Anti­ <lb/>
            quities, many of the articles in which are written by Mr. <lb/>
            Long himself. The student of classical literature will <lb/>
            naturally prefer the exhaustive essays to be found in <lb/>
            these works to any notes appended to Plutarch's text, <lb/>
            while to those who read merely " for the story," the <lb/>
            notes prove both troublesome and useless.</p>
          <p>In deciding on the spelling of the Greek proper names, <lb/>
            I have felt great hesitation. To make a Greek speak of <lb/>
            Juno or Minerva seems as absurd as to make a Roman <lb/>
            swear by Herakles or Ares. Yet both Greek and Roman <lb/>
            divinities are constantly mentioned. The only course that <lb/>
            seemed to avoid absolute absurdity appeared to me to be <lb/>
            that which I have adopted, namely to speak of the Greek <lb/>
            divinities by their Greek, and the Latin ones by their <lb/>
            Latin names. In substituting a k for the more usual c, I <lb/>
            have followed the example of Grote, who in his History <lb/>
            spells all Greek names exactly as they are written, with the <lb/>
            exception of those with which we are so familiar in their <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            Latin form as to render this practically impossible; as for <lb/>
            instance in the case of Cyprus or Corinth, or of a name <lb/>
            like Thucydides, where a return to the Greek k would <lb/>
            be both pedantic and unmeaning.</p>
          <p>The text, which I have followed throughout, is that <lb/>
            of C. Sintenis, Leipsic. 1873.</p>

            <title type="main">PREFACE TO THE CIVIL WARS OF ROME.-</title>
          </head>
          <p>AMONG the extant Lives of Plutarch there are thirteen <lb/>
            Lives of Romans which belong to the most eventful <lb/>
            period of Roman history. They are the lives of the <lb/>
            brothers Tiberius and Caius Sempronuis Gracchus of <lb/>
            Caius Marius Lucius Corelius Sulla. Quintus Sertorius, <lb/>
            Marcus Licinius (Crassus, Cneius PompeiusMagnus, 4 <lb/>
            Marcus Porcius Catothe Younger, Sfarcus Tullius Cicero, <lb/>
            Lucius Licinius Lucullus Caius Julius Cæsar Marcus <lb/>
            Junius Brutus and Marcus Antonius From tlie year <lb/>
            of the death 01Tiberius Gracchus, B.C. 133, to the <lb/>
            death of Marcus Antonius, B.C. 30, a period of about <lb/>
            one hundred years, the Roman State was convulsed by <lb/>
            revolutions which grew out of the contest between the <lb/>
            People and the Nobility, or rather, out of the contests <lb/>
            between the leaders of these two bodies. This period is <lb/>
            the subject of Appian's History of the Civil Wars of the <lb/>
            Romans, in Five Books. Appian begins with the Tribu­ <lb/>
            nate and legislation of Tiberius Gracchus, from which he <lb/>
            proceeds to the Dictatorship of Bulla, and then to the <lb/>
            quarrels between Pompeius and Caesar, and Cæsar's <lb/>
            Dictatorship and assassination. He then proceeds to the <lb/>
            history of the Triumvirate formed after Cæsar's death by <note type="footnote"> * It has been thought desirable to give here Mr. Long's preface to <lb/>
            the lives published by him, under the title of " Civil Wars of Rome <lb/>
            The lives will be found in subsequent volumes </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            ais great nephew Caius Julius Cæsar Octavianus, Marcus <lb/>
            Antonius, and Lepidus, the quarrels of the Triumviri, the <lb/>
            downfall of Lepidus, who was reduced to the condition of <lb/>
            a private person, and the death of Sextus Pompeius, the <lb/>
            last support of the party in whose cause his father, <lb/>
            Cneius Pompeius, lost his life. The remainder of this <lb/>
            History, which is lost, carried the narration down to the <lb/>
            quarrels of Octavianus and Marcus Antonius, which <lb/>
            ended in the defeat of Antonius in the battle of Actium, <lb/>
            B.C. 31, and his death in Egypt, B.C. 30. The victory <lb/>
            over Antonius placed all the power in the hands of <lb/>
            Octavianus, who, in the year B.C. 27, received from the <lb/>
            Roman Senate the title of Augustus, or the Sacred, by <lb/>
            which name he is commonly known as the first of the <lb/>
            long series of Roman Emperors. " He made himself," <lb/>
            says Appian (Civil Wars, i. 5), "like Caius Julius Cæsar, <lb/>
            and still more than Cæsar, governor of his country and <lb/>
            of all the nations under it, without needing either election <lb/>
            or the popular votes, or any show of such things. After <lb/>
            his government had subsisted for a long time, and been <lb/>
            maintained with vigour, fortunate in all his measures, <lb/>
            and feared, he left behind him descendants and succes­ <lb/>
            sors who kept the power that he transmitted to them. <lb/>
            In this way, after various civil commotions, the Roman <lb/>
            State was restored to tranquillity, and the government <lb/>
            became a Monarchy. And how this came about I have <lb/>
            explained, and brought together all the events, which <lb/>
            are well worth the study of those who wish to become <lb/>
            acquainted with ambition of men unbounded, love of <lb/>
            power excessive, endurance unwearied, and forms of <lb/>
            suffering infinite.,, Thus, the historian's object was to <lb/>
            trace the establishment of the Imperial power in Rome <lb/>
            back to its origin, to show that the contests of the rival <lb/>
            heads of parties involved the State in endless calamities, <lb/>
            which resulted in a dissolution of all the bonds that hel <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            society together, and rendered the assumption of supreme <lb/>
            power by one man a healing and a necessary event.</p>
          <p>As already observed, it happens that thirteen of <lb/>
            Plutarch's extant Lives are the lives of the most distin­ <lb/>
            guished of the Romans who lived during this eventful <lb/>
            period; and though Plutarch's Lives severally are not <lb/>
            histories of the times to which they respectively refer, <lb/>
            nor collectively form a History of any given time, yet <lb/>
            they are valuable as portraits of illustrious men, and help <lb/>
            us to form a better judgment of those who make so <lb/>
            conspicuous a figure in History.</p>
          <p>Plutarch was a native of the town of Chæroneia, in <lb/>
            Bœotia ; the times of his birth and death are not exactly <lb/>
            known, but we learn from his own works that he was a <lb/>
            young student at Delphin, in the thirteenth year of the <lb/>
            reign ofthe Emperor Nero, A.D. 66. —He visited both <lb/>
            Italy and Rome, and probably resided at Rome for some <lb/>
            time. He wrote his Life of Demosthenes, at least after <lb/>
            his return to Chaeroneia: he says (Life of Demosthenes, <lb/>
            c. 2), that he had not time to exercise himself in the <lb/>
            Latin Language during his residence at Rome, being <lb/>
            much occupied with public business, and giving lessons <lb/>
            in philosophy. Accordingly it was late before he began <lb/>
            to read the Latin writers; and we may infer from his <lb/>
            own words that he never acquired a very exact know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the language. He observes that it happened in <lb/>
            his case, that in his study of the Latin writers he did <lb/>
            not so much learn and understand the facts from the <lb/>
            words, as acquire the meaning of the words from the <lb/>
            facts, of which he had already some knowledge. We <lb/>
            may perhaps conclude from this, that Plutarch wrote all <lb/>
            his Roman lives in Chæroneia, after he had returned <lb/>
            there from Rome. The statement that Plutarch was <lb/>
            the preceptor of the Emperor Trajan, and was raised to <lb/>
            the consular rank by him, is not supported by sufficient <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            evidence. Plutarch addressed to Trajan his Book C <lb/>
            Apophthegms, or Sayings of Kings and Commanders ; <lb/>
            but this is all that is satisfactorily ascertained as to <lb/>
            the connection between the Emperor and Philosopher. <lb/>
            Trajan died A.D. 117.</p>
          <p>"The plan of Plutarch's Biographies is briefly ex­ <lb/>
            plained by himself in the introduction to the Life of <lb/>
            Alexander the Great, where he makes an apology for the <lb/>
            brevity with which he is compelled to treat of the <lb/>
            numerous events in the Lives of Alexander and Cæsar. <lb/>
            4 For,' he says, ‘ I do not write Histories, but Lives; nor <lb/>
            do the most conspicuous acts of necessity exhibit a man's <lb/>
            virtue or his vice, but oftentimes some slight circum­ <lb/>
            stance, a word, or a jest, shows a man's character better <lb/>
            than battles with the slaughter of tens of thousands, <lb/>
            and the greatest arrays of armies and sieges of cities. ^ <lb/>
            Now, as painters produce a likeness by a representation <lb/>
            of the countenance and the expression of the eyes, with­ <lb/>
            out troubling themselves about the other parts of the <lb/>
            body, so I must be allowed to look rather into the signs <lb/>
            of a man's character, and thus give a portrait of his life, <lb/>
            leaving others to describe great events and battles.' The <lb/>
            object then of Plutarch in his Biographies was a moral <lb/>
            end, and the exhibition of the principal events in a man's <lb/>
            lire was subordinate to this his main design ; and though <lb/>
            he may not always have adhered to the principle which <lb/>
            he laid down, it cannot be denied that his view of what <lb/>
            biography should be, is much more exact than that of <lb/>
            most persons who have attempted this style of composi. <lb/>
            tion. The life of a statesman or of a general, when <lb/>
            written with a view of giving a complete history of all <lb/>
            the public events in which he was engaged, is not <lb/>
            biography, but history. This extract from Plutarch will <lb/>
            also in some measure be an apology for the want of <lb/>
            historical order observable in many of his Lives. Though <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            altogether deficient in that critical sagacity which dis­ <lb/>
            corns truth from falsehood, and distinguishes the intrica­ <lb/>
            cies of confused and conflicting statements, Plutarch h as <lb/>
            preserved in his Lives a vast number of facts which <lb/>
            would otheiwise have been unknown to us. He was a <lb/>
            great reader, and must have had access to large libraries. <lb/>
            It is said that he quotes two hundred and fifty writers, <lb/>
            a great part of whose works are now entirely lost.,, <lb/>
            (Penny Cyclopœdia, art. " Plutarch," by the writer of this <lb/>
            Preface.)</p>
          <p>The lively portraitures of men draw in Plutarch's <lb/>
            Lives have made them favourite reading in all ages. <lb/>
            Whether Plutarch has succeeded in drawing the portraits <lb/>
            true, we cannot always determine, because the materials <lb/>
            for such a judgment are sometimes wanting. But when <lb/>
            we can compare his Lives with other extant authorities, <lb/>
            we must admit, that though he is by no means free from <lb/>
            error as to his facts, he has generally selected those <lb/>
            events in a man's life which most clearly show his <lb/>
            temper, and that on the whole, if we judge of a man by <lb/>
            Plutarch's measure, we shall form a just estimate of him. <lb/>
            He generally wrote without any predilections or any <lb/>
            prejudices. He tells us of a man's good and bad acts, of <lb/>
            his good and bad qualities; he makes no attempt to <lb/>
            conceal the one or the other; he both praises and blames <lb/>
            as the occasion may arise; and the reader leaves off with <lb/>
            a mixed opinion about Plutarch's Greeks and Romans, <lb/>
            though the favourable or the unfavourable side always <lb/>
            predominates. The benevolent disposition of Plutarch, <lb/>
            and his noble and elevated character, have stamped them­ <lb/>
            selves on all that he has written. A man cannot read <lb/>
            these Lives without being the better for it: his detesta­ <lb/>
            tion of all that is mean and disingenuous will be in­ <lb/>
            creased ; his admiration of whatever is truthful and <lb/>
            generous will be strengthened and exalted.</p><pb n="xvi"/>
            
          <p>The translation of these Lives is difficult. Plutarch's <lb/>
            text is occasionally corrupted; and where it is not <lb/>
            corrupted, his meaning is sometimes obscure. Many of <lb/>
            the sentences are long and ill-constructed ; the metaphors <lb/>
            often extravagant; and the just connection of the parts <lb/>
            is sometimes difficult to discover. Many single words <lb/>
            which are or ought to be pertinent in Plutarch, and <lb/>
            which go towards a description of character in general <lb/>
            or of some particular act, can hardly be rendered by any <lb/>
            English equivalent; and a translator often searches in <lb/>
            vain for something which shall convey to the reader the <lb/>
            exact notion of the original. Yet Plutarch's narrative <lb/>
            is lively and animated; his anecdotes are appropriately <lb/>
            introduced and well told; and if his taste is sometimes <lb/>
            not the purest, which in his age we could not expect it <lb/>
            to be, he makes amends for this by the fulness and <lb/>
            vigour of his expression. He is fond of poetical words, <lb/>
            and they are often used with striking effect. His moral <lb/>
            reflections, which are numerous, have the merit of not <lb/>
            being unmeaning and tiresome, because he is always in <lb/>
            earnest and has got something to say, and does not deal <lb/>
            in commonplaces. When the reflection is not very pro­ <lb/>
            found, it is at least true; and some of his remarks show <lb/>
            a deep insight into men's character.</p>
          <p>I have attempted to give Plutarch's meaning in plain <lb/>
            language ; to give all his meaning, and neither more nor <lb/>
            less. If I have failed in any case, it is because I could <lb/>
            do no better. But, though I have not always succeeded <lb/>
            in expressing exactly what I conceive to be the meaning <lb/>
            of the original, I have not intentionally added to it or <lb/>
            detracted from it. It may be that there are passages in <lb/>
            which I have mistaken the original; and those who have <lb/>
            made the experiment of rendering from one language into <lb/>
            another, know that this will sometimes happen even in <lb/>
            an easy passage. A difficult passage attracts more than <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            usual of a translator's attention, and if he fails there, it <lb/>
            is either because the difficulty cannot be overcome, or <lb/>
            because he cannot overcome it. Mere inadvertence or <lb/>
            sleepiness may sometimes cause a translator to blunder, <lb/>
            when he would not have blundered if any friend had <lb/>
            been by to keep him awake.</p>
          <p>The best thing that a man can do to avoid these and <lb/>
            other errors is to compare his translation, when he has <lb/>
            finished it, with some other. The translation which I <lb/>
            have compared with mine is the German translation of <lb/>
            Kaltwasser, Magdeburg, 1799, which is generally correct. <lb/>
            Kaltwasser in his Preface speaks of the way in which he <lb/>
            used the German translations of two of his predecessors, <lb/>
            J. Christopher Kind, Leipzig, 1745-1754, and H. v. <lb/>
            Schirach, 1776-1780, and some others. He says, " These <lb/>
            two translations, with the French translations above <lb/>
            mentioned, I have duly used, for it is the duty of a <lb/>
            translator to compare himself with his predecessors; but <lb/>
            I lay my labour before the eyes of the public, without <lb/>
            fearing that I shall be accused of copying or of close <lb/>
            imitation. First of all, I carefully studied the text of <lb/>
            my author and translated him as well as I could: then, <lb/>
            and not before, I compared the labour of my predecessors, <lb/>
            and where I found a more suitable expression or a happier <lb/>
            turn, I made use of it without hesitation. In this way, <lb/>
            every fault, every deviation of the old translators must <lb/>
            be apparent; the most striking of them I have remarked <lb/>
            on in the notes, but I have more frequently amended such <lb/>
            things silently, as a comparison will show the reader." <lb/>
            The translator has not compared his version with any <lb/>
            English version. The translation of North, which has <lb/>
            great merit in point of expression, is a version of Amyot's <lb/>
            French version, from which, however, it differs in some <lb/>
            passages, where it is decidedly wrong and Amyot's version <lb/>
            is right. Indeed, it is surprising to find how correct <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xviii"/>
            this old French translation generally is. The translation <lb/>
            of ‘ Plutarch's Lives from the Greek by several hands,' <lb/>
            was published at London in 1683-86. It was dedicated <lb/>
            by Dryden to James Butler, the first Duke of Ormond, <lb/>
            in a fulsome panegyric. It is said that forty-one trans­ <lb/>
            lators laboured at the work. Dryden did not translate <lb/>
            any of the Lives; but he wrote the Life of Plutarch <lb/>
            which is prefixed to this translation. The advertisement <lb/>
            prefixed to the translation passes under the name and <lb/>
            character of the bookseller (Jacob Tonson), but, as <lb/>
            Malone observes, it may from internal evidence be safely <lb/>
            attributed to Dryden. The bookseller says, "You have <lb/>
            here the first volume of Plutarch's Lives turned from the <lb/>
            Greek into English; and give me leave to say, the first <lb/>
            attempt of doing it from the originals." This is aimed <lb/>
            at North's version, of which Dryden remarks in his <lb/>
            Life of Plutarch: " As that translation was only from <lb/>
            the French, so it suffered this double disadvantage; first, <lb/>
            that it was but a copy of a copy, and that too but <lb/>
            lamely taken from the Greek original; secondly, that the <lb/>
            English language was then unpolished, and far from the <lb/>
            perfection which it has since attained; so that the first <lb/>
            version is not only ungrammatical and ungraceful, but <lb/>
            in many places almost unintelligible." There is another <lb/>
            English version, by the Langhornes, which has often <lb/>
            been reprinted; there is an edition of it with notes by <lb/>
            Wrangham. I have compared my translation carefully <lb/>
            with the German of Kaltwasser, and sometimes with the <lb/>
            French of Amyot, and I have thus avoided some errors <lb/>
            into which I should have fallen. There are errors both <lb/>
            in the versions of Amyot and Kaltwasser which I have <lb/>
            avoided; but I may have fallen into others.</p>
          <p>The translation of Kaltwasser contains some useful <lb/>
            notes. Those which I have added to this translation are <lb/>
            intended to explain so much as needs explanation to a <lb/>
             <pb n="xix"/>
            person who is not much acquainted with Roman history <lb/>
            and Roman usages; but they will also be useful to <lb/>
            others. The notes of Kaltwasser have often reminded <lb/>
            me of the passages where some note would be useful, and <lb/>
            have occasionally furnished materials also. But as I <lb/>
            have always referred to the original authorities, I do not <lb/>
            consider it necessary to make more than this general ac­ <lb/>
            knowledgment. The notes added to this translation are all <lb/>
            my own, and contain my own opinions and observations.</p>
          <p>This translation has been made from the edition of <lb/>
            C. Sintenis, Leipzig, 1839, and I have compared the text <lb/>
            of Sintenis with that of G. H. Schaefer, Leipzig, 1826, <lb/>
            which has been severely criticized : this edition contains, <lb/>
            however, some useful notes. I have very seldom made <lb/>
            any remarks on the Greek text, as such kind of remark <lb/>
            would not have suited the plan and design of this version, <lb/>
            which is not intended for verbal critics.</p>
          <p>I shall explain by two brief extracts what is my main <lb/>
            design in this version and in the notes, which must be <lb/>
            my apology for not affecting a learned commentary, and <lb/>
            my excuse to those who shall not find here the kind of <lb/>
            remarks that are suitable to a critical edition of an <lb/>
            ancient author. I have had another object than to dis­ <lb/>
            cuss the niceties of words and the forms of phrases, a <lb/>
            labour which is well in its place, if it be done well, but <lb/>
            is not what needs to be done to such an author as <lb/>
            Plutarch to render him useful. A man who was a great <lb/>
            reader of Plutarch, a just and solid thinker above the <lb/>
            measure of his age, and not surpassed in his way by any <lb/>
            writer in our own, Montaigne, observes in his Essay <lb/>
            of the Education of Children'—" Let him enquire into <lb/>
            the manners, revenues, and alliances of princes, things <lb/>
            in themselves very pleasant to learn, and very useful to <lb/>
            know. In this conversing with men, I mean, and princi­ <lb/>
            pally those who only live in the records of history, he <note type="footnote"> b 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            shall by reading those books, converse with those great <lb/>
            and heroic souls of former and better ages. 'Tis an idle <lb/>
            and vain study, I confess, to those who make it so, by <lb/>
            doing it after a negligent manner, but to those who de <lb/>
            it with care and observation, 'tis a study of inestimable <lb/>
            fruit and value; and the only one, as Plato reports, <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians reserved to themselves. What profit <lb/>
            shall he not reap as to the business of men, by reading <lb/>
            the Lives of Plutarch? But withal, let my governor <lb/>
            remember to what end his instructions are principally <lb/>
            directed, and that he do not so much imprint in his <lb/>
            pupil's memory the date of the ruin of Carthage, as the <lb/>
            manners of Hannibal and Scipio; not so much where <lb/>
            Marcellus died, as why it was unworthy of his duty that <lb/>
            he died there. That he do not teach him so much the <lb/>
            narrative part, as the business of history. The reading <lb/>
            of which, in my opinion, is a thing that of all others we <lb/>
            apply ourselves unto with the most differing and uncer­ <lb/>
            tain measures."* North, in his address to the Reader, <lb/>
            says : " The profit of stories, and the praise of the Author, <lb/>
            are sufficiently declared by Amiot, in his Epistle to the <lb/>
            Reader: so that I shall not need to make many words <lb/>
            thereof. And indeed if you will supply the defects of <lb/>
            this translation, with your own diligence and good under­ <lb/>
            standing: you shall not need to trust him, you may <lb/>
            prove yourselves, that there is no prophane study better <lb/>
            than Plutarch. All other learning is private, fitter for <lb/>
            Universities than Cities, fuller of contemplation than <lb/>
            experience, more commendable in students themselves, <lb/>
            than profitable unto others. Whereas stories are fit for <lb/>
            every place, reach to all persons, serve for all times, teach <lb/>
            the living, revive the dead, so far excelling all other <lb/>
            books, as it is better to see learning in Noblemen's lives, <lb/>
            an to read it in Philosophers' writings."</p>

          <p>PLUTARCH was born probably between A.D. 45 and A.D. 50, <lb/>
            at the little town of Chaeronea in Bœotia. His family <lb/>
            appears to have been long established in this place, the <lb/>
            scene of the final destruction of the liberties of Greece, <lb/>
            when Philip defeated the Athenians and Boeotian forces <lb/>
            there in 338 B.C. It was here also that Sulla defeated <lb/>
            Mithridates, and in the great civil wars of Rome we again <lb/>
            hear, this time from Plutarch himself, of the sufferings of <lb/>
            the citizens of Chaeronea. Nikarchus, Plutarch's great- <lb/>
            grandfather, was, with all the other citizens, without any <lb/>
            exception, ordered by a lieutenant of Marcus Antonius to <lb/>
            transport a quantity of corn from Chaeronea to the coast <lb/>
            opposite the island of Antikyra. They were compelled to <lb/>
            carry the corn on their shoulders, like slaves, and were <lb/>
            threatened with the lash if they were remiss. After they had <lb/>
            performed one journey, and were preparing their burdens for <lb/>
            a second, the welcome news arrived that Marcus Antonius <lb/>
            had lost the battle of Actium, whereupon both the officers <lb/>
            and soldiers of his party stationed in Chaeronea at once <lb/>
            fled for their own safety, and the provisions thus collected <lb/>
            were divided among the inhabitants of the city.</p>
          <p>When Plutarch was born, however, no such warlike <lb/>
            scenes as these were to be expected. Nothing more than <lb/>
            the traditions of war remained on the shores of the <lb/>
            Mediterranean. Occasionally some faint echo of strife <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiv"/>
            would make itself heard from the wild tribes m the <lb/>
            Danube, or in the far Syrian deserts, but over nearly all <lb/>
            the world known to the ancients was established the Pax <lb/>
            Romana. Battles were indeed fought, and troops were <lb/>
            marched upon Rome, but this was merely to decide who <lb/>
            was to be the nominal head of the vast system of the <lb/>
            Empire, and what had once been independent cities, <lb/>
            countries, and nations submitted unhesitatingly to who­ <lb/>
            ever represented that irresistible power. It might be <lb/>
            imagined that a political system which destroyed all <lb/>
            national individuality, and rendered patriotism in its <lb/>
            highest sense scarcely possible, would have reacted <lb/>
            unfavourably on the literary character of the age. Yet <lb/>
            nothing of the kind can be urged against the times which <lb/>
            produced Epictetus, Dio Chrysostom and Arrian ; while <lb/>
            at Rome, Pliny the Younger, Tacitus, Martial, and Juvenal <lb/>
            were reviving the memories of the Augustan age.</p>
          <p>From several passages in Plutarch's writings we gather <lb/>
            that he studied under a master named Ammonius, at <lb/>
            Athens. For instance, at the end of his Life of Themis­ <lb/>
            tokles, he mentions a descendant of that great man who <lb/>
            was his fellow-student at the house of Ammonius the <lb/>
            philosopher. Again, he tells us that once Ammonius, ob­ <lb/>
            serving at his afternoon lecture that some of his class had <lb/>
            indulged too freely in the pleasures of the table, ordered <lb/>
            his own son to be flogged, " because," he said, “ the young <lb/>
            gentleman cannot eat his dinner without pickles," casting <lb/>
            his eye at the same time upon the other offenders so as to <lb/>
            make them sensible that the reproof applied to them also.</p>
          <p>By way of completing his education he proceeded to <lb/>
            visit Egypt. The " wisdom of the Egyptians " always <lb/>
            seems to have had a fascination for the Greeks, and at <lb/>
            this period Alexandria, with its famous library and its <lb/>
            memories of the Ptolemies, of Kallimachus and of Theo­ <lb/>
            kritus, was an important centre of Greek intellectual <lb/>
             <pb n="xxv"/>
            activity. Plutarch's treatise on Isis and Osiris is generally <lb/>
            supposed to be a juvenile work suggested by his Egyptian <lb/>
            travels. In all the Græco-Egyptian lore he certainly <lb/>
            became well skilled, although we have no evidence as to <lb/>
            how long he remained in Egypt. He makes mention <lb/>
            indeed of a feast given in his honour by some of his <lb/>
            relatives on the occasion of his return home from Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, but we can gather nothing from the passage as to <lb/>
            his age at that time.</p>
          <p>One anecdote of his early life is as follows:—“ I <lb/>
            remember," he says, " that when I was still a young man, <lb/>
            I was sent with another person on a deputation to the <lb/>
            Proconsul; my colleague, as it happened, was unable to <lb/>
            proceed, and I saw the Proconsul and performed the <lb/>
            commission alone. When I returned I was about to lay <lb/>
            down my office and to give a public account of how I had <lb/>
            discharged it, when my father rose in the public assembly <lb/>
            and enjoined me not to say I went, but we went, nor to <lb/>
            say that I said, but we said, throughout my story, giving <lb/>
            my colleague his share."</p>
          <p>The most important event in the whole of Plutarch's <lb/>
            pious and peaceful life is undoubtedly his journey to Italy <lb/>
            and to Rome; but here again we know little more than <lb/>
            that he knew but little Latin when he went thither, and <lb/>
            was too busy when there to acquire much knowledge of <lb/>
            that tongue. His occupation at Rome, besides antiquarian <lb/>
            researches which were afterwards worked up into his Roman <lb/>
            Lives, was the delivery of lectures on philosophical and <lb/>
            other subjects, a common practice among the learned <lb/>
            Greeks of his day. Many of these lectures, it is conjec­ <lb/>
            tured, were afterwards recast by him into the numerous <lb/>
            short treatises on various subjects now included under the <lb/>
            general name of Moralia. Plutarch's visit to Rome and <lb/>
            business there is admirably explained in the following <lb/>
            passage of North'a ‘ Life of Plutarch':—“ For my part, I <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvi"/>
            think Plutarch was drawn to Rome by meanes of some <lb/>
            friends he had there, especially by Sossius Senecio, that <lb/>
            had been a Consull, who was of great estimation at that <lb/>
            time, and namely under the Empire of Trajan. And that <lb/>
            which maketh me think so, is because of Plutarch's own <lb/>
            words, who saith in the beginning of his first book of his <lb/>
            discourse at the table, that he gathered together all his <lb/>
            reasons and discourses made here and there, as well in <lb/>
            Rome with Senecio, as in Greece with Plutarch and <lb/>
            others. Not being likely that he would have taken the <lb/>
            pains to have made so long a voyage, and to have come <lb/>
            to such a city where he understood not their vulgar <lb/>
            tongue, if he had not been drawn thither by Senecio, and <lb/>
            such other men; as also in acknowledgement of the good <lb/>
            turnes and honour he had received by such men, he dedi­ <lb/>
            cated diverse of his bookes unto them, and among others, <lb/>
            the Lives unto Senecio, and the nine volumes of his <lb/>
            discourse at the table, with the treaty, How a man may <lb/>
            know that he profiteth in vertue. Now for the time, <lb/>
            considering what he saith in the end of his book against <lb/>
            curiosity, I suppose that he taught in Rome in the time <lb/>
            of Titus and of Domitian : for touching this point, he <lb/>
            maketh mention of a nobleman called Rusticus, who being <lb/>
            one day at his lecture, would not open a letter which was <lb/>
            brought him from the Emperor, nor interrupt Plutarch, <lb/>
            but attended to the end of his declamation, and until all <lb/>
            the hearers were gone away; and addeth also, that <lb/>
            Rusticus was afterwards put to death by the commandment <lb/>
            of Domitian. Furthermore, about the beginning of the <lb/>
            Life of Demosthenes, Plutarch saith, that whilst he <lb/>
            remained in Italy and at Rome, he had no leizure to study <lb/>
            the Latine tongue; as well for that he was busied at that <lb/>
            time with matters he had in hand, as also to satisfie those <lb/>
            that were his followers to learne philosophic of hinc ”*. <note type="footnote"> * North's ‘ Plutarch,’ 1631, p. 1194. </note></p><pb n="xxvii"/>
            
          <p>A list of all Plutarch's writings would be a very long <lb/>
            one. Besides the Lives, which is the work on which his <lb/>
            fame chiefly rests, he wrote a book of ‘ Table Talk,' which <lb/>
            may have suggested to Athenaeus the plan of his <lb/>
            4 Symposium.'</p>
          <p>The most remarkable of his minor works is that' Or <lb/>
            the Malignity of Herodotus.' Grote takes this treatise <lb/>
            as being intended seriously as an attack upon the historian, <lb/>
            and speaks of the " honourable frankness which Plutarch <lb/>
            calls his malignity." But it is probably merely a rhetor­ <lb/>
            ical exercise, in which Plutarch has endeavoured to see <lb/>
            what could be said against so favourite and well-known <lb/>
            a writer.</p>
          <p>He was probably known as an author before he went <lb/>
            to Rome. Large capitals have always had a natural <lb/>
            attraction for literary genius, as it is in them alone that <lb/>
            it can hope to be appreciated. And if this be the case at <lb/>
            the present day, how much more must it have been so <lb/>
            before the invention of printing, at a time when it was <lb/>
            more usual to listen to books read aloud than to read <lb/>
            them oneself ? Plutarch journeyed to Rome just as Hero­ <lb/>
            dotus went to Athens, or as he is said to have gone to the <lb/>
            Olympian festival, in search of an intelligent audience of <lb/>
            educated men. Whether his object was merely praise, or <lb/>
            whether he was influenced by ideas of gain, we cannot <lb/>
            say. No doubt his lectures were not delivered gratis, and <lb/>
            that they were well attended seems evident from Plutarch's <lb/>
            own notices of them, and from the names which have <lb/>
            been preserved of the eminent men who used to frequent <lb/>
            them. Moreover, strange though it may appear to us, <lb/>
            the demand for books seems to have been very brisk even <lb/>
            though they were entirely written by hand.</p>
          <p>The epigrams of Martial inform us of the existence of <lb/>
            a class of slaves whose occupation was copying books, <lb/>
            and innumerable allusions in Horace, Martial, &amp;c., to the <lb/>
             <pb n="xxviii"/>
            Sosii and others prove that the trade of a bookseller at <lb/>
            Rome was both extensive and profitable. Towards tho <lb/>
            end of the Republic it became the fashion for Roman <lb/>
            nobles to encourage literature by forming a library, and <lb/>
            this taste was given immense encouragement by Augustus, <lb/>
            who established a public library in the Temple of Apollo <lb/>
            on the Mount Palatine, in imitation of that previously <lb/>
            founded by Asinius Pollio. There were other libraries <lb/>
            besides these, the most famous of which was the Ulpian <lb/>
            library, founded by Trajan, who called it so from his own <lb/>
            name, Ulpius. Now Trajan was a contemporary of our <lb/>
            author, and this act of his clearly proves that there must <lb/>
            have been during Plutarch's lifetime a considerable <lb/>
            reading public, and consequent demand for books at <lb/>
            Rome.</p>
          <p>Of Plutarch's travels in Italy we know next to nothing. <lb/>
            He mentions incidentally that he had seen the bust or <lb/>
            statue of Marius at Ravenna, but never gives us another <lb/>
            hint of how far he explored the country about which he <lb/>
            wrote so much. No doubt his ignorance of the Latin <lb/>
            language must not be taken as a literal statement, and <lb/>
            probably means that he was not skilled in it as a spoken <lb/>
            tongue, for we can scarcely imagine that he was without <lb/>
            some acquaintance with it when he first went to Rome, <lb/>
            and he certainly afterwards became well read in the <lb/>
            literature of Rome. In some cases he has followed Livy's <lb/>
            narrative with a closeness which proves that he must <lb/>
            have been acquainted with that author either in the <lb/>
            original or in a translation, and the latter alternative is, <lb/>
            of the two, the more improbable.</p>
          <p>It seems to be now generally thought that his stay at <lb/>
            Rome was a short one. Clough, in his excellent Preface, <lb/>
            says on this subject, " The fault which runs through all <lb/>
            the earlier biographies, from that of Rualdus downwards, <lb/>
            is the assumption, wholly untenable, that Plutarch passed <lb/>
             <pb n="xxix"/>
            many years, as many perhaps as forty, at Rome. The <lb/>
            entire character of his life is of course altered by such an <lb/>
            impression." He then goes on to say that in consequence <lb/>
            of this mistaken idea, it is not worth while for him to <lb/>
            quote Dryden's ‘ Life of Plutarch,' which was originally <lb/>
            prefixed to the translations re-edited by himself. Yet I <lb/>
            trust I may be excused if I again quote North's 6 Life of <lb/>
            Plutarch,' as the following passage seems to set vividly <lb/>
            before us the quiet literary occupation of his later days.</p>
          <p>" For Plutarch, though he tarried a long while in Italy, <lb/>
            and in Rome, yet that tooke not away the remembrance of <lb/>
            the sweet aire of Greece, and of the little towne where he <lb/>
            was borne; but being touched from time to time with a <lb/>
            sentence of an ancient poet, who saith that, <lb/>
            ‘ In whatsoever countrey men are bred <lb/>
            (I know not by what sweetnesse of it led), <lb/>
            They nourish in their minds a glad desire, <lb/>
            Unto their native homes for to retire,' <lb/>
            he resolved to go back into Greece againe, there to end the <lb/>
            rest of his dates in rest and honour among his citizens, of <lb/>
            whom he was honourably welcomed home. Some judge <lb/>
            that he left Rome after the death of Trajan, being then of <lb/>
            great yeares, to leade a more quiet life. So being then at <lb/>
            rest, he earnestly took in hand that which he had long <lb/>
            thought of before, to wit, the Lives, and tooke great pains <lb/>
            with it until he had brought his worke to perfection, as <lb/>
            we have done at this present; although that some Lives, <lb/>
            as those of Scipio African, of Metellus Numidicus, and <lb/>
            some other are not to be found. Now himselfe confesseth <lb/>
            in some place, that when he began this worke, at the first <lb/>
            it was but to profit others; but that afterwards it was to <lb/>
            profit himselfe, looking upon those histories, as if he had <lb/>
            looked in a glasse, and seeking to reform his life in some <lb/>
            sort, and to forme it in the mould of the vertues of these <lb/>
            great men; taking this fashion of searching their manners, <lb/>
             <pb n="xxx"/>
            and writing the Lives of these noble men, to be a familiar <lb/>
            haunting and frequenting of them. Also he thought, <lb/>
            [said he himselfe] that he lodged these men one after <lb/>
            another in his house, entering into consideration of their <lb/>
            qualities, and that which was great in either of them, <lb/>
            choosing and principally taking that which was to be <lb/>
            noted, and most worthy to be knowne in their sayings <lb/>
            and deeds."*</p>
          <p>Of Plutarch in his domestic relations we gather much <lb/>
            information from his own writings. The name of his <lb/>
            father has not been preserved, but it was probably <lb/>
            Nikarchus, from the common habit of Greek families to <lb/>
            repeat a name in alternate generations. His brothers <lb/>
            Timon and Lamprias are frequently mentioned in his <lb/>
            essays and dialogues, where Timon is spoken of in <lb/>
            the most affectionate terms. Rualdus has ingeniously <lb/>
            recovered the name of his wife, Timoxena, from internal <lb/>
            evidence afforded by his writings. A touching letter is <lb/>
            still extant, addressed by Plutarch to his wife, bidding <lb/>
            her not give way to excessive grief at the death of their <lb/>
            only daughter, who was named Timoxena after her <lb/>
            mother. The number of his sons we cannot exactly state. <lb/>
            Autobulus and Plutarch are especially spoken of as his <lb/>
            sons, since the treatise on the Timaeus of Plato is dedicated <lb/>
            to them, and the marriage of his son Autobulus is the <lb/>
            occasion of one of the dinner-parties recorded in the ‘ Table <lb/>
            Talk.' Another person, one Soklarus, is spoken of in terms <lb/>
            which seem to imply that he was Plutarch's son, but this <lb/>
            is nowhere definitely stated. His treatise also on Marriage <lb/>
            Questions, addressed to Eurydike and Pollianus, seems to <lb/>
            speak of her as having been recently an inmate of his <lb/>
            house, but without enabling us to form an opinion whether <lb/>
            she was his daughter or not. A modem writer well <lb/>
            describes his maturer years by the words : " Plutarch was <note type="footnote"> 0 North's 'Plutarch,' 1631, p. 1198. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxi"/>
            well born, well taught, well conditioned; a self-respecting <lb/>
            amiable man, who knew how to better a good education <lb/>
            by travels, by devotion to affairs private and public; a <lb/>
            master of ancient culture, he read books with a just <lb/>
            criticism : eminently social, he was a king in his own house, <lb/>
            surrounded himself with select friends, and knew the <lb/>
            high value of good conversation ; and declares in a letter <lb/>
            written to his wife that ‘ he finds scarcely an erasure, as <lb/>
            in a book well written, in the happiness of his life.' "</p>
          <p>He was an active member of the little community of <lb/>
            Chaeronea, being archon of that town. Whether this <lb/>
            dignity was annual or for life we do not know, but it was <lb/>
            probably the former, and very likely he served it more <lb/>
            than once. He speaks of his devotion to the duties of his <lb/>
            office as causing him to incur the ridicule of some of <lb/>
            his fellow-citizens, when they saw him engaged in the <lb/>
            humblest duties, " But," he says, in Clough's version, " the <lb/>
            story told about Antisthenes comes to my assistance. <lb/>
            When some one expressed surprise at his carrying home <lb/>
            some pickled fish from market in his own hands, It is, he <lb/>
            answered, for myself. Conversely, when I am reproached <lb/>
            with standing by and watching while tiles are measured <lb/>
            out, and stone and mortar brought up, This service, I say, is <lb/>
            not for myself it is for my country."</p>
          <p>Plutarch was for many years a priest of Apollo at <lb/>
            Delphi. The scene of some of his ‘ Table Talk' is laid there, <lb/>
            when he in his priestly capacity gives a dinner party in <lb/>
            honour of the victor in the poetic contest at the Pythian <lb/>
            games. Probably this office was a source of considerable <lb/>
            income, and as the journey from Chaeronea to Delphi, <lb/>
            across Mount Parnassus, is a very short one, it interfered <lb/>
            but little with his literary and municipal business. In <lb/>
            his essay on " Whether an old man should continue to take <lb/>
            part in public life," he says, "You know, Euphanes, that I <lb/>
            have for many Pythiads (that is, periods of four years <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxii"/>
            elapsing between the Pythian festivals), exercised the <lb/>
            office of Priest of Apollo: yet I think you would not say <lb/>
            to me, Plutarch, you have sacrificed enough; you have led <lb/>
            processions and dances enough; it is time, now that you <lb/>
            are old, to lay aside the garland from your head, and to <lb/>
            retire as superannuated from the oracle.' "</p>
          <p>Thus respected and loved by all, Plutarch's old age <lb/>
            passed peacefully away. " Notwithstanding,” as North says, <lb/>
            " that he was very old, yet he made an end of the Lives ... <lb/>
            Furthermore, Plutarch, having lived alwaies honourably <lb/>
            even to old age, he died quietly among his children and <lb/>
            friends in the city of Chaeronea, leaving his writings, an <lb/>
            immortal savour of his name, unto posterity. Besides the <lb/>
            honour his citizens did him, there was a statue set up for <lb/>
            him by ordinance of the people of Rome, in memory of his <lb/>
            virtues. Now furthermore, though time hath devoured <lb/>
            some part of the writings of this great man, and minished <lb/>
            some other: neverthelesse those which remaine, being a <lb/>
            great number, have excellent use to this day among us’</p>

          <p>I. As in books on geography, Sossius Senecio, the writers <lb/>
            crowd the countries of which they know nothing into the <lb/>
            furthest margins of their maps, and write upon them <lb/>
            legends such as, " In this direction lie waterless deserts <lb/>
            full of wild beasts;" or, “ Unexplored morasses;" or, <lb/>
            “ Here it is as cold as Scythia ;” or, “ A frozen sea so <lb/>
            I, in my writings on Parallel Lives, go through that <lb/>
            period of time where history rests on the firm basis of <lb/>
            facts, and may truly say, “ All beyond this is portentous <lb/>
            and fabulous, inhabited by poets and mythologers, and <lb/>
            there is nothing true or certain."</p>
          <p>When I had written the lives of Lykurgus the law­ <lb/>
            giver and Numa the king, it appeared to me natural to go <lb/>
            back to Romulus also, as I was engaged on the history of <lb/>
            times so close to his. So when I was reflecting, in the <lb/>
            words of AEschylus, <lb/>
            a Against this chieftain, who can best contend ? <lb/>
            Whom shall I match in fight, what trusty friend ?” <lb/>
            it occurred to me to compare the founder of the fair and <lb/>
            famous city of Athens with him, and to contrast Theseus <lb/>
            with the father of unconquered glorious Rome. Putting <lb/>
            aside, then, the mythological element, let us examine his <lb/>
            story, and wherever it obstinately defies probability, and <lb/>
            cannot be explained by natural agency, let us beg the in­ <lb/>
            dulgence of our readers, who will kindly make allowance <lb/>
            for tales of antiquity. <note type="footnote"> B </note></p><pb n="2"/>
            
          <p>II. Theseus appears to have several points of resemblance <lb/>
            to Romulus. Both were unacknowledged illegitimate <lb/>
            children, and were reputed to descend from the Gods. <lb/>
            “ Both warriors, well we all do know: <lb/>
            and both were wise as well as powerful. The one founded <lb/>
            Rome, while the other was the joint founder of Athens; <lb/>
            and these are two of the most famous of cities. Both <lb/>
            carried off women by violence, and neither of them escaped <lb/>
            domestic misfortune and retribution, but towards the end <lb/>
            of their lives both were at variance with their countrymen, <lb/>
            if we may put any trust in the least extravagant writings <lb/>
            upon the subject.</p>
          <p>III. Theseus traced his descent on the father's side from <lb/>
            Erechtheus and the original Autocthones,* while on the <lb/>
            mother's side he was descended from Pelops. For Pelops <lb/>
            surpassed all the other princes of the Peloponnesus in the <lb/>
            number of his children as well as in wealth; and of these <lb/>
            he gave many of his daughters in marriage to the chief <lb/>
            men of the country, and established many of his sons as <lb/>
            rulers in various cities. One of these, Pittheus, the grand­ <lb/>
            father of Theseus, founded Trœzen, which is indeed but <lb/>
            a little state, though he had a greater reputation than any <lb/>
            man of his time for eloquence and wisdom. The nature <lb/>
            of this wisdom of his seems to have been much of the <lb/>
            same kind as that which made the reputation of <lb/>
            Hesiod, in the collection of maxims known as the ‘ Works <lb/>
            and Days.' One of these maxims is indeed ascribed to <lb/>
            Pittheus: <lb/>
            “ Let promised pay be truly paid to friends." <lb/>
            At any rate, this is what Aristotle the philosopher has <lb/>
            recorded ; and also Euripides, when he speaks of Hippolytus <lb/>
            as “ child of holy Pittheus," shows the prevailing opinion <lb/>
            about Pittheus. Now Ægeus desired to have children, <lb/>
            and the Oracle at Delphi is said to have given him the <lb/>
            well-known response, forbidding him to have intercourse <note type="footnote"> * Autochthones was the name by which the original citizens of <lb/>
            Athens called themselves, meaning that they were sprung from the <lb/>
            soil itself, not immigrants from some other country. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            with any woman before he reached Athens, but not <lb/>
            appearing to explain this clearly. Consequently, on his <lb/>
            way home, he went to Trœzen, and asked the advice of <lb/>
            Pittheus about the response of the God, which ran thus: <lb/>
            “ Great chief, the wine-skin's foot must closed remain, <lb/>
            Till thou to Athens art returned again." <lb/>
            Pittheus clearly perceived what the oracle must mean, and <lb/>
            persuaded or cheated Ægeus into an intrigue with Æthra. <lb/>
            Afterwards, when he discovered that he had conversed <lb/>
            with the daughter of Pittheus, as he imagined that she <lb/>
            might prove with child, he left behind him his sword and <lb/>
            sandals hidden under a great stone, which had a hollow <lb/>
            inside it exactly fitting them. This he told to AEthra <lb/>
            alone, and charged her if a son of his should be born, and <lb/>
            on growing to man's estate should be able to lift the stone <lb/>
            and take from under it the deposit, that she should send <lb/>
            him at once with these things to himself, in all secrecy, <lb/>
            and as far as possible concealing his journey from obser­ <lb/>
            vation. For he greatly feared the sons of Pallas, who <lb/>
            plotted against him, and despised him on account of his <lb/>
            childlessness, they themselves being fifty brothers, all the <lb/>
            sons of Pallas.</p>
          <p>IV. When Æthra's child was born, some writers say <lb/>
            that he was at once named Theseus, from the tokens <lb/>
            placed under the stone; others say that he was afterwards <lb/>
            so named at Athens, when Ægeus acknowledged him as <lb/>
            his son. He was brought up by his grandfather Pittheus, <lb/>
            and had a master and tutor, Konnidas, to whom even to <lb/>
            the present day, the Athenians sacrifice a ram on the day <lb/>
            before the feast of Theseus, a mark of respect which is <lb/>
            much more justly due to him, than those which they pay <lb/>
            to Silanion and Parrhasius, who have only made pictures <lb/>
            and statues of Theseus.</p>
          <p>V. As it was at that period still the custom for those <lb/>
            who were coming to man's estate to go to Delphi and offer <lb/>
            to the god the first-fruits of their hair (which was then <lb/>
            cut for the first time),* Theseus went to Delphi, and they <note type="footnote">* The first cutting of the hair was always an occasion of solemnity <lb/>
            among the Greeks, the hair being dedicated to some god. The first <lb/>
            instance of this is in Homer's Iliad, where Achilles speaks of having </note> <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            say that a place there is even to this day named after him. <lb/>
            But he only cut the front part of his hair, as Homer tells <lb/>
            us the Abantes did, and this fashion of cutting the hair <lb/>
            was called Theseus's fashion because of him. The Abantes <lb/>
            first began to cut their hair in this manner, not having, as <lb/>
            some say, been taught to do so by the Arabians, nor yet <lb/>
            from any wish to imitate the Mysians, but because they <lb/>
            were a warlike race, and met their foes in close combat, <lb/>
            and studied above all to come to a hand-to-hand fight with <lb/>
            their enemy, as Archilochus bears witness in his verses: <lb/>
            “ They use no slings nor bows, <lb/>
            Eubœa's martial lords, <lb/>
            But hand to hand they close <lb/>
            And conquer with their swords.” <lb/>
            So they cut their hair short in front, that their enemies <lb/>
            might not grasp it. And they say that Alexander of <lb/>
            Macedon for the same reason ordered his generals to have <lb/>
            the beards of the Macedonians shaved, because they were <lb/>
            a convenient handle for the enemy to grasp.</p>
          <p>VI. Now while he was yet a child, Æthra concealed <lb/>
            the real parentage of Theseus, and a story was circulated <lb/>
            by Pittheus that his father was Poseidon. For the people <lb/>
            of Trœzen have an especial reverence for Poseidon; he is <lb/>
            their tutelar deity; to him they offer first-fruits of their <lb/>
            harvest, and they stamp their money with the trident <lb/>
            as their badge. But when he was grown into a youth, <lb/>
            and proved both strong in body and of good sound sense, <lb/>
            then AEthra led him to the stone, told him the truth <lb/>
            about his father, and bade him take the tokens from <lb/>
            beneath it and sail to Athens with them. He easily lifted <lb/>
            the stone, but determined not to go to Athens by sea, <lb/>
            though the voyage was a safe and easy one, and though <lb/>
            his mother and his grandfather implored him to go that <lb/>
            way. By land it was a difficult matter to react Athens, <lb/>
            as the whole way was infested with robbers and bandits. <lb/>
            That time, it seems, produced men of great and un­ <lb/>
            wearied strength and swiftness, who made no good use of <note type="footnote"> dedicated his hair to the river Spercheius. The Athenian youth <lb/>
            offered their hair to Herakles. The Roman emperor Nero, in latef <lb/>
            times, imitated this custom. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            these powers, but treated all men with overbearing inso­ <lb/>
            lence, taking advantage of their strength to overpower <lb/>
            and slay all who fell into their hands, and disregarding <lb/>
            justice and right and kindly feeling, which they said <lb/>
            were only approved of by those who dared not do injury <lb/>
            to others, or feared to be injured themselves, while men <lb/>
            who could get the upper hand by force might disregard <lb/>
            them. Of these ruffians, Herakles in his wanderings cut <lb/>
            off a good many, but others had escaped him by concealing <lb/>
            themselves, or had been contemptuously spared by him on <lb/>
            account of their insignificance. But Herakles had the mis­ <lb/>
            fortune to kill Iphitus, and thereupon sailed to Lydia and <lb/>
            was for a long time a slave in that country under Omphale, <lb/>
            which condition he had imposed upon himself as a penance <lb/>
            for the murder of his friend. During this period the <lb/>
            country of Lydia enjoyed peace and repose; but in Greece <lb/>
            the old plague of brigandage broke out afresh, as there <lb/>
            was now no one to put it down. So that the journey <lb/>
            overland to Athens from Peloponnesus was full of peril; <lb/>
            and Pittheus, by relating to Theseus who each of these <lb/>
            evildoers was, and how they treated strangers, tried to <lb/>
            prevail upon him to go by sea. But it appears that <lb/>
            Theseus had for a long time in his heart been excited by <lb/>
            the renown of Herakles for courage: he thought more <lb/>
            of him than of any one else, and loved above all to listen <lb/>
            to those who talked of him, especially if they had seen <lb/>
            and spoken to him. Now he could no longer conceal that <lb/>
            he was in the same condition as Themistokles in later <lb/>
            times, when he said that the trophy of Miltiades would <lb/>
            not let him sleep. Just so did the admiration which <lb/>
            Theseus conceived for Herakles make him dream by night <lb/>
            of his great exploits, and by day determine to equal them <lb/>
            by similar achievements of his own.</p>
          <p>VII. As it happened, they were connected, being second <lb/>
            cousins; for AEthra was the daughter of Pittheus, and <lb/>
            Alkmena the daughter of Lysidike, and Lysidike and <lb/>
            Pittheus were brother and sister, being the children of <lb/>
            Pelops and Hippodameia. So Theseus thought that it <lb/>
            would be a great and unbearable disgrace to him that his <lb/>
            cousin should go everywhere and clear the sea and land <lb/>
            of the brigands who infested them, and he should refuse <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            to undertake the adventures that came in his way; throw­ <lb/>
            ing discredit upon his reputed father by a pusillanimous <lb/>
            flight by sea, and upon his real father by bringing him <lb/>
            only the sandals and an unfleshed sword, and not proving <lb/>
            his noble birth by the evidence of some brave deed accom­ <lb/>
            plished by him. In this spirit he set out on his journey, <lb/>
            with the intention of doing wrong to no one, but of <lb/>
            avenging himself on any one who offered wrong to him.</p>
          <p>VIII. And first in Epidaurus he slew Periphetes, who <lb/>
            used a club as his weapon, and on this account was called <lb/>
            the club-bearer, because he laid hands upon him and <lb/>
            forbade him to proceed farther on his way. The club took &lt; <lb/>
            his fancy, and he adopted it as a weapon, and always used <lb/>
            it, just as Herakles used his lion's skin; for the skin was <lb/>
            a proof of how huge a beast the wearer had overcome, <lb/>
            while the club, invincible in the hands of Theseus, had <lb/>
            yet been worsted when used against him. At the Isthmus <lb/>
            he destroyed Sinis the Pine-bender by the very device by <lb/>
            which he had slain so many people, and that too without <lb/>
            having ever practised the art, proving that true valour <lb/>
            is better than practice and training. Sinis had a daughter, <lb/>
            a tall and beautiful girl, named Perigoune. When her <lb/>
            father fell she ran and hid herself. Theseus sought her <lb/>
            everywhere, but she fled into a place where wild asparagus <lb/>
            grew thick, and with a simple child-like faith besought the <lb/>
            plants to conceal her, as if they could understand her words, <lb/>
            promising that if they did so she never would destroy or <lb/>
            burn them. However, when Theseus called to her, pledging <lb/>
            himself to take care of her and do her no hurt, she came <lb/>
            out, and afterwards bore Theseus a son, named Melanippus. <lb/>
            She afterwards was given by Theseus in marriage to <lb/>
            Deioneus, the son of Eurytus of Œchalia. Ioxus, a son of <lb/>
            Melanippus, and Theseus's grandchild, took part in <lb/>
            Ornytus's settlement in Caria; and for this reason the <lb/>
            descendants of Ioxus have a family custom not to burn <lb/>
            the asparagus plant, but to reverence and worship it.</p>
          <p>IX. Now the wild sow of Krommyon, whom they called 1 <lb/>
            Phaia, was no ordinary beast, but a fierce creature and <lb/>
            hard to conquer. This animal he turned out of his way <lb/>
            to destroy, that it might not be thought that he performed <lb/>
            his exploits of necessity. Besides, he said, a brave man <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            need only punish wicked men when they came in his <lb/>
            way, but that in the case of wild beasts he must himself <lb/>
            seek them out and attack them. Some say that Phaia <lb/>
            was a murderous and licentious woman who carried on <lb/>
            brigandage at Krommyon, and was called a sow from her <lb/>
            life and habits, and that Theseus put her to death.</p>
          <p>X. Before coming to Megara he slew Skeiron by flinging <lb/>
            him down a precipice into the sea, so the story runs, <lb/>
            because he was a robber, but some say that from arrogance <lb/>
            he used to hold out his feet to strangers and bid them <lb/>
            wash them, and that then he kicked the washers into the <lb/>
            sea. But Megarian writers, in opposition to common <lb/>
            tradition, and, as Simonides says, “ warring with all <lb/>
            antiquity," say that Skeiron was not an arrogant brigand, <lb/>
            but repressed brigandage, loved those who were good and <lb/>
            just, and was related to them. For, they point out, Æakus <lb/>
            is thought to have been the most righteous of all the <lb/>
            Greeks, and Kychreus of Salamis was worshipped as a <lb/>
            god, and the virtue of Peleus and Telamon is known to <lb/>
            all. Yet Skeiron was the son-in-law of Kychreus, and <lb/>
            father-in-law of Æakus, and grandfather of Peleus and <lb/>
            Telamon, who were both of them sons of Endeis, the <lb/>
            daughter of Skeiron and his wife Chariklo. It is not then <lb/>
            reasonable to suppose that these, the noblest men of their <lb/>
            time, would make alliances with a malefactor, and give <lb/>
            and receive from him what they prized most dearly. But <lb/>
            they say that Theseus slew Skeiron, not when he first <lb/>
            went to Athens, but that afterwards he took the town of <lb/>
            Eleusis which belonged to the Megarians, by dealing <lb/>
            treacherously with Dickies, who was the chief magistrate <lb/>
            there, and that on that occasion he killed Skeiron. This <lb/>
            is what tradition says on both sides.</p>
          <p>XI. At Eleusis Theseus overcame Kerkyon of Arcadia in <lb/>
            wrestling and killed him, and after journeying a little farther <lb/>
            he killed Damastes, who was surnamed Prokroustes, by com­ <lb/>
            pelling him to fit his own body to his bed, just as he used <lb/>
            to fit the bodies of strangers to it. This he did in imita­ <lb/>
            tion of Herakles ; for he used to retort upon his aggressors <lb/>
            the same treatment which they intended for him. Thus <lb/>
            Herakles offered up Busiris as a sacrifice, and overcame <lb/>
            Antæus in wrestling, and Kyknus in single combat, and <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            killed Termerus by breaking his skull. This is, they say, <lb/>
            the origin of the proverb, “ A Termerian mischief," for <lb/>
            Termerus, it seems, struck passers-by with his head, and <lb/>
            so killed them. So also did Theseus sally forth and <lb/>
            chastise evildoers, making them undergo the same cruelties <lb/>
            which they practised on others, thus justly punishing <lb/>
            them for their crimes in their own wicked fashion.</p>
          <p>XII. As he proceeded on his way, and reached the <lb/>
            river Kephisus, men of the Phytalid race were the first to <lb/>
            meet and greet him. He demanded to be purified from <lb/>
            the guilt of bloodshed, and they purified him, made pro­ <lb/>
            pitiatory offerings, and also entertained him in their <lb/>
            houses, being the first persons from whom he had received <lb/>
            any kindness on his journey. It is said to have been on <lb/>
            the eighth day of the month Kronion, which is now called <lb/>
            Hekatombeion, that he came to his own city. On entering <lb/>
            it he found public affairs disturbed by factions, and the <lb/>
            house of Ægeus in great disorder; for Medea, who had <lb/>
            been banished from Corinth, was living with Ægeus, and <lb/>
            had engaged by her drugs to enable Ægeus to have <lb/>
            children. She was the first to discover who Theseus was, <lb/>
            while Ægeus, who was an old man, and feared every one <lb/>
            because of the disturbed state of society, did not recognise <lb/>
            him. Consequently she advised Ægeus to invite him to a <lb/>
            feast. that she might poison him. Theseus accordingly <lb/>
            came to Ægeus's table. He did not wish to be the first to <lb/>
            tell his name, but, to give his father an opportunity of <lb/>
            recognising him, he drew his sword, as if he meant to cut <lb/>
            some of the meat with it, and showed it to Ægeus. <lb/>
            Ægeus at once recognised it, overset the cup of poison, <lb/>
            looked closely at his son and embraced him. He then <lb/>
            called a public meeting and made Theseus known as his <lb/>
            son to the citizens, with whom he was already very popular <lb/>
            because of his bravery. It is said that when the cup was <lb/>
            overset the poison was spilt in the place where now there <lb/>
            is the enclosure in the Delphinium, for there Ægeus dwelt; <lb/>
            and the Hermes to the east of the temple there they call <lb/>
            the one who is “ at the door of Ægeus.”</p>
          <p>XIII. But the sons of Pallas, who had previously to <lb/>
            this expected that they would inherit the kingdom on the <lb/>
            death of Ægeus without issue, now that Theseus was <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            declared the heir, were much enraged, first that Ægeus <lb/>
            should be king, a man who was merely an adopted child <lb/>
            of Pandion, and had no blood relationship to Erechtheus, <lb/>
            and next that Theseus, a stranger and a foreigner, should <lb/>
            inherit the kingdom. They consequently declared war. <lb/>
            Dividing themselves into two bodies, the one proceeded to <lb/>
            march openly upon the city from Sphettus, under the com­ <lb/>
            mand of PaRas their father, while the other lay in ambush <lb/>
            at Gargettus, in order that they might fall upon their <lb/>
            opponents on two sides at once. But there was a herald <lb/>
            among them named Leos, of the township of Agnus, who <lb/>
            betrayed the plans of the sons of Pallas to Theseus. He <lb/>
            suddenly. attacked those who were in ambush, and killed <lb/>
            them all, hearing which the other body under Pallas <lb/>
            dispersed. From this time forth they say that the town­ <lb/>
            ship of Pallene has never intermarried with that of Agnus, <lb/>
            and that it is not customary amongst them for heralds to <lb/>
            begin a proclamation with the words " Acouete Leo," <lb/>
            (Oyez) for they hate the name of Leo* because of the <lb/>
            treachery of that man.</p>
          <p>XIV. Now Theseus, who wished for employment, and <lb/>
            also to make himself popular with the people, went to <lb/>
            attack the Lull of Marathon, who had caused no little <lb/>
            trouble to the inhabitants of Tetrapolis. He overcame <lb/>
            the beast, and drove it alive through the city for all men <lb/>
            to see, and then sacrificed it to Apollo of Delphi. Hekale, <lb/>
            too, and the legend of her having entertained Theseus, does <lb/>
            not seem altogether without foundation in fact; for the <lb/>
            people of the neighbouring townships used to assemble and <lb/>
            perform what was called the Hekalesian sacrifice to Zeus <lb/>
            Hekalus, and they also used to honour Hekale, calling her <lb/>
            by the affectionate diminutive Hekaline, because she also, <lb/>
            when feasting Theseus, who was very young, embraced <lb/>
            him in a motherly way, and used such like endearing <lb/>
            diminutives. She also made a vow on Theseus's behalf, <lb/>
            when he was going forth to battle, that if he returned <lb/>
            safe she would sacrifice to Zeus; but as she died before he <lb/>
            returned, she had the above-mentioned honours instituted <lb/>
            by command of Theseus, as a grateful return for her <lb/>
            hospitality. This is the legend as told by Philochorus. <note type="footnote"> * The Greek word leos signifies people. </note> <pb n="10"/>
            </p>
          <p>XV. Shortly after this the ship from Crete arrived for <lb/>
            the third time to collect the customary tribute. Most <lb/>
            writers agree that the origin of this was, that on the death <lb/>
            of Androgens, in Attica, which was ascribed to treachery, <lb/>
            his father Minos went to war, and wrought much evil to <lb/>
            the country, which at the same time was afflicted by <lb/>
            scourges from Heaven (for the land did not bear fruit, and <lb/>
            there was a great pestilence and the rivers sank into the <lb/>
            earth). So that as the oracle told the Athenians that, if <lb/>
            they propitiated Minos and came to terms with him, the <lb/>
            anger of Heaven would cease and they should have a <lb/>
            respite from their sufferings, they sent an embassy to <lb/>
            Minos and prevailed on him to make peace, on the con­ <lb/>
            dition that every nine years they should send him a <lb/>
            tribute of seven youths and seven maidens. The most <lb/>
            tragic of the legends states these poor children when they <lb/>
            reached Crete were thrown into the Labyrinth, and there <lb/>
            either were devoured by the Minotaur or else perished with <lb/>
            hunger, being unable to find the way out. The Minotaur, <lb/>
            as Euripides tells us, was <lb/>
            " A form commingled, and a monstrous birth, <lb/>
            Half man, half bull, in twofold shape combined."</p>
          <p>XVI. Philochorus says that the Cretans do not recog­ <lb/>
            nise this story, but say that the Labyrinth was merely a <lb/>
            prison, like any other, from which escape was impossible, <lb/>
            and that Minos instituted gymnastic games in honour of <lb/>
            Androgeus, in which the prizes for the victors were these <lb/>
            children, who till then were kept in the Labyrinth. Also <lb/>
            they say that the victor in the first contest was a man of <lb/>
            great power in the state, a general of the name of Taurus, <lb/>
            who was of harsh and savage temper, and ill-treated the <lb/>
            Athenian children. And Aristotle himself, in his treatise <lb/>
            on the constitution of the Bottiæans, evidently does not <lb/>
            believe that the children were put to death by Minos, but <lb/>
            that they lived in Crete as slaves, until extreme old age; <lb/>
            and that one day the Cretans, in performance of an ancient <lb/>
            vow, sent first-fruits of their population to Delphi. Among <lb/>
            those who were thus sent were the descendants of the <lb/>
            Athenians, and, as they could not maintain themselves <lb/>
            there, they first passed over to Italy, and there settled <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            near Iapygium, and from thence again removed to Thrace, <lb/>
            and took the name of Bottiæans. For this reason, the <lb/>
            Bottiæan maidens when performing a certain sacrifice <lb/>
            sing “ Let us go to Athens." Thus it seems to be a terrible <lb/>
            thing to incur the hatred of a city powerful in speech and <lb/>
            song ; for on the Attic stage Minos is always vilified and <lb/>
            traduced, and though he was called “ Most Kingly " by <lb/>
            Hesiod, and “ Friend of Zeus " by Homer, it gained him no <lb/>
            credit, but the playwrights overwhelmed him with abuse, <lb/>
            styling him cruel and violent. And yet Minos is said to <lb/>
            have been a king and a lawgiver, and Rhadamanthus to <lb/>
            have been a judge under him, carrying out his decrees.</p>
          <p>XVII. So when the time of the third payment of the <lb/>
            tribute arrived, and those fathers who had sons not yet <lb/>
            grown up had to submit to draw lots, the unhappy people <lb/>
            began to revile Ægeus, complaining that he, although the <lb/>
            author of this calamity, yet took no share in their afflic­ <lb/>
            tion, but endured to see them left childless, robbed of <lb/>
            their own legitimate offspring, while he made a foreigner <lb/>
            and a bastard the heir to his kingdom. This vexed <lb/>
            Theseus, and determining not to hold aloof, but to share the <lb/>
            fortunes of the people, he came forward and offered himself <lb/>
            without being drawn by lot. The people all admired <lb/>
            his courage and patriotism, and Ægeus finding that his <lb/>
            prayers and entreaties had no effect on his unalterable <lb/>
            resolution, proceeded to choose the rest by lot. Hellanikus <lb/>
            says that the city did not select the youths and maidens <lb/>
            by lot, but that Minos himself came thither and chose <lb/>
            them, and that he picked out Theseus first of all, upon <lb/>
            the usual conditions, which were that the Athenians <lb/>
            should furnish a ship, and that the youths should embark <lb/>
            in it and sail with him, not carrying with them any <lb/>
            weapon of war; and that when the Minotaur was slain, <lb/>
            the tribute should cease. Formerly, nO one had any hope <lb/>
            of safety; so they used to send out the ship with a black <lb/>
            sail, as if it were going to a certain doom; but now <lb/>
            Theseus so encouraged his father, and boasted that he <lb/>
            would overcome the Minotaur, that he gave a second sail, <lb/>
            a white one, to the steersman, and charged him on his <lb/>
            return, if Theseus were safe, to hoist the white one, if not, <lb/>
            the black one as a sign of mourning. But Simonides says <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            that it was not a white sail which was given by Ægeus, <lb/>
            but " a scarlet sail embrued in holm oak's juice," and that <lb/>
            this was agreed on by him as the signal of safety. The <lb/>
            ship was steered by Phereklus the son of Amarsyas, <lb/>
            according to Simonides.</p>
          <p>But Philochorus says that Theseus had one Nausithous <lb/>
            sent him from Skirus of Salamis, to steer the ship, and <lb/>
            Phæax to act as look-out, as the Athenians had not yet <lb/>
            turned their attention to the sea.</p>
          <p>One of the youths chosen by lot was Menestheos the <lb/>
            son of Skirus's daughter. The truth of this account is <lb/>
            attested by the shrines of Nausithous and Phæax, which <lb/>
            Theseus built at Phalerum, and by the feast called the <lb/>
            Kybernesia or pilot's festival, which is held in their <lb/>
            honour.</p>
          <p>XVIII. When the lots were drawn Theseus brought the <lb/>
            chosen youths from the Prytaneum, and proceeding to the <lb/>
            temple of the Delphian Apollo, offered the suppliants' <lb/>
            bough to Apollo on their behalf. This was a bough of <lb/>
            the sacred olive-tree bound with fillets of white wool. <lb/>
            And after praying he went to sea on the sixth day of the <lb/>
            month Munychion, on which day even now they send <lb/>
            maidens as suppliants to the temple of the Delphian <lb/>
            Apollo. And there is a legend that the Delphian oracle <lb/>
            told him that Aphrodite would be his guide and fellow­ <lb/>
            traveller, and that when he was sacrificing a she-goat to <lb/>
            her by the seaside, it became a he-goat; wherefore the <lb/>
            goddess is called Epitragia.</p>
          <p>XIX. When they reached Crete, according to most <lb/>
            historians and poets, Ariadne fell in love with him, and <lb/>
            from her he received the clue of string, and was taught <lb/>
            how to thread the mazes of the Labyrinth. He slew the <lb/>
            Minotaur, and, taking with him Ariadne and the youths, <lb/>
            sailed away. Pherekydes also says that Theseus also <lb/>
            knocked out the bottoms of the Cretan ships, to prevent <lb/>
            pursuit. But Demon says that Taurus, Minos's general, <lb/>
            was slain in a sea-fight in the harbour, when Theseus <lb/>
            sailed away. But according to Philochorus, when Minos <lb/>
            instituted his games, Taurus was expected to win every <lb/>
            prize, and was grudged this honour; for his great influence <lb/>
            and his unpopular manners made him disliked, and soandal <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            said, that he was too intimate with Pasiphae. On this <lb/>
            account, when Theseus offered to contend with him, Minos <lb/>
            agreed. And, as it was the custom in Crete for women as <lb/>
            well as men to be spectators of the games, Ariadne was <lb/>
            present, and was struck with the appearance of Theseus, <lb/>
            and his strength, as he conquered all competitors. Minos <lb/>
            was especially pleased, in the wrestling match, at Taurus's <lb/>
            defeat and shame, and, restoring the children to Theseus, <lb/>
            remitted the tribute for the future. Kleidemus tells the <lb/>
            story in his own fashion and at unnecessary length, be­ <lb/>
            ginning much farther back. There was, he says, a <lb/>
            decree passed by all the Greeks, that no ship should sail <lb/>
            from any post with more than five hands on board, but <lb/>
            Jason alone, the master of the great ship Argo, should <lb/>
            cruise about, and keep the sea free of pirates. Now when <lb/>
            Daedalus fled to Athens, Minos, contrary to the decree, <lb/>
            pursued him in long war galleys, and being driven to <lb/>
            Sicily by a storm, died there. When his son Deukalion <lb/>
            sent a warlike message to the Athenians, bidding them <lb/>
            give up Daedalus to him, or else threatening that he <lb/>
            would put to death the children whom Minos had taken <lb/>
            as hostages, Theseus returned him a gentle answer, beg­ <lb/>
            ging for the life of Dædalus, who was his own cousin <lb/>
            and blood relation, being the son of Merope, the daughter <lb/>
            of Erechtheus. But he busied himself with building a <lb/>
            fleet, some of it in Attica, in the country of the Thymai­ <lb/>
            tadae, far from any place of resort of strangers, and some <lb/>
            in Trœzen, under the management of Pittheus, as he did <lb/>
            not wish his preparations to be known. But when the <lb/>
            ships were ready to set sail, having with him as pilots, <lb/>
            Dædalus himself and some Cretan exiles, as no one <lb/>
            knew that he was coming, and the Cretans thought that it <lb/>
            was a friendly fleet that was advancing, he seized the <lb/>
            harbour, and marched at once to Knossus before his arrival <lb/>
            was known. Then he fought a battle at the gates of the <lb/>
            Labyrinth, and slew Deukalion and his body-guard. As <lb/>
            Ariadne now succeeded to the throne, he made peace with <lb/>
            her, took back the youths, and formed an alliance between <lb/>
            the Cretans and the Athenians, in which each nation <lb/>
            swore that it would not begin a war against the other.</p>
          <p>XX. There are many more stories about these events, <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            and about Ariadne, none of which agree in any particulars. <lb/>
            Some say that she hanged herself when deserted by <lb/>
            Theseus, and some, that she was taken to Naxos by his <lb/>
            sailors, and there dwelt with Œnarus, the priest of <lb/>
            Dionysus, having been deserted by Theseus, who was in <lb/>
            love with another. <lb/>
            “ For Ægle's love disturbed his breast." <lb/>
            This line, we are told by Hereas of Megara, was struck <lb/>
            out of Hesiod's poems by Peisistratus ; and again he says <lb/>
            that he inserted into Homer's description of the Shades, <lb/>
            a Peirithous and Theseus, born of gods," <lb/>
            to please the Athenians. Some writers say that Theseus <lb/>
            had by Ariadne two sons, Staphylus and Œnopion, whom <lb/>
            Ion of Chios follows when he speaks of his own native <lb/>
            city as that <lb/>
            " Which erst (Enopion stablished, Theseus' son." <lb/>
            The pleasantest of these legends are in nearly every one's <lb/>
            mouth. But Pæon of Amathus gives an account peculiar to <lb/>
            himself, that Theseus was driven by a storm to Cyprus, <lb/>
            and that Ariadne, who was pregnant, suffered much from <lb/>
            the motion of the ship, and became so ill, that she was set <lb/>
            on shore, but Theseus had to return to take charge of the <lb/>
            ship, and was blown off to sea. The women of the country <lb/>
            took care of Ariadne, and comforted her in her bereave­ <lb/>
            ment, even bringing forged letters to her as if from <lb/>
            Theseus, and rendering her assistance during her confine­ <lb/>
            ment ; and when she died in childbirth, they buried her. <lb/>
            Theseus, on his return, grieved much, and left money to <lb/>
            the people of the country, bidding them sacrifice to <lb/>
            Ariadne; he also set up two little statues, one of silver, <lb/>
            and the other of brass. And at this sacrifice, which takes <lb/>
            place on the second day of the month Gorpiæus, one of the <lb/>
            young men lies down on the ground, and imitates the cries <lb/>
            of a woman in travail; and the people of Amathus call <lb/>
            that the grove of Ariadne Aphrodite, in which they show <lb/>
            her tomb.</p>
          <p>But some writers of Naxos tell a different story, peculiar <lb/>
            to themselves, that there were two Minoses and two <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            Ariadnes, of whom one, they say, was married to Dionysus <lb/>
            in Naxos, and was the mother of Staphylus and his brother, <lb/>
            while the younger was carried off by Theseus, and came <lb/>
            to Naxos after he deserted her; and a nurse called Korkyne <lb/>
            came with her, whose tomb they point out. Then Naxians <lb/>
            also says that this Ariadne died there, and is honoured, <lb/>
            but not so much as the elder; for at the feast in honour <lb/>
            of the elder, there are merriment and revelry, but at that <lb/>
            of the younger gloomy rites are mingled with mirth.</p>
          <p>XXI. Theseus, when he sailed away from Croto, touched <lb/>
            at Delos ; here he sacrificed to the god and offered up the <lb/>
            statue of Aphrodite, which Ariadne had given him; and <lb/>
            besides this, he and the youths with him danced a measure <lb/>
            which they say is still practised by the people of Delos to <lb/>
            this day, being an imitation of the turnings and windings <lb/>
            of the Labyrinth expressed by complicated evolutions per­ <lb/>
            formed in regular order. This kind of dance is called by <lb/>
            the Delians “ the crane dance," according to Diksearchus. <lb/>
            It was danced round the altar of the Horns, which is all <lb/>
            formed of horns from the left side. They also say that he <lb/>
            instituted games at Delos, and that then for the first time <lb/>
            a palm was given by him to the victor.</p>
          <p>XXII. As he approached Attica, both he and his steers­ <lb/>
            man in their delight forgot to hoist the sail which was to <lb/>
            be a signal of their safety to Ægeus ; and he in his despair <lb/>
            flung himself down the cliffs and perished. Theseus, as <lb/>
            soon as he reached the harbour, performed at Phalerum <lb/>
            the sacrifices which he had vowed to the gods if he re­ <lb/>
            turned safe, and sent off a herald to the city with the news <lb/>
            of his safe return. This man met with many who were <lb/>
            lamenting the death of the king, and, as was natural, with <lb/>
            others who were delighted at the news of their safety, and <lb/>
            who congratulated him and wished to crown him with <lb/>
            garlands. These he received, but placed them on his <lb/>
            herald's staff, and when he came back to the seashore, <lb/>
            finding that Theseus had not completed his libation, he <lb/>
            waited outside the temple, not wishing to disturb the <lb/>
            sacrifice. When the libation was finished he announced <lb/>
            the death of Ægeus, and then they all hurried up to the <lb/>
            city with loud lamentations: wherefore to this day, at <lb/>
            the Oschophoria, they say that it is not the herald that is <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            crowned, but his staff, and that at the libations the by­ <lb/>
            standers cry out, “Eleleu, Iou, Iou;" of which cries the <lb/>
            first is used by men in haste, or raising the paean for <lb/>
            battle, while the second is used by persons in surprise and <lb/>
            trouble.</p>
          <p>Theseus, after burying his father, paid his vow to <lb/>
            Apollo, on the seventh day of the month Pyanepsion; for <lb/>
            on this day it was that the rescued youths went up into <lb/>
            the city. The boiling of pulse, which is customary on <lb/>
            this anniversary, is said to be done because the rescued <lb/>
            youths put what remained of their pulse together into one <lb/>
            pot, boiled it all, and merrily feasted on it together. And <lb/>
            on this day also, the Athenians carry about the Eiresione, <lb/>
            a bough of the olive tree garlanded with wool, just as <lb/>
            Theseus had before carried the suppliants' bough, and <lb/>
            covered with first-fruits of all sorts of produce, because the <lb/>
            barrenness of the land ceased on that day; and they sing, <lb/>
            “ Eiresione, bring us figs <lb/>
            And wheaten loaves, and oil, <lb/>
            And wine to quaff, that we may all <lb/>
            Rest merrily from toil."</p>
          <p>However, some say that these ceremonies are performed <lb/>
            in memory of the Herakleidæ, who were thus entertained <lb/>
            by the Athenians; but most writers tell the tale as I have <lb/>
            told it.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Now the thirty-oared ship, in which Theseus <lb/>
            sailed with the youths, and came back safe, was kept by <lb/>
            the Athenians up to the time of Demetrius Phalereus. <lb/>
            They constantly removed the decayed part of her timbers. <lb/>
            and renewed them with sound wood, so that the ship <lb/>
            became an illustration to philosophers of the doctrine of <lb/>
            growth and change, as some argued that it remained the <lb/>
            same, and others, that it did not remain the same. The <lb/>
            feast of the Oschophoria, or of carrying boughs, which to <lb/>
            this day the Athenians celebrate, was instituted by <lb/>
            Theseus. For he did not take with him all the maidens <lb/>
            who were drawn by lot, but he chose two youths, his <lb/>
            intimate friends, who were feminine and fair to look upon, <lb/>
            but of manly spirit; those by warm baths and avoiding <lb/>
            the heat of the sun and careful tending of their hair and <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            skin he completely metamorphosed, teaching them to <lb/>
            imitate the voice and carriage and walk of maidens. <lb/>
            These two were then substituted in the place of two of <lb/>
            the girls, and deceived every one; and when they re­ <lb/>
            turned, he and these two youths walked in procession, <lb/>
            dressed as now those who carry boughs at the Oschophoria <lb/>
            are dressed. They carry them in honour of Dionysus and <lb/>
            Ariadne, because of the legend, or rather because they <lb/>
            returned home when the harvest was being gathered in. <lb/>
            And the women called supper-carriers join in carrying <lb/>
            them and partake of the sacrifice, in imitation of the <lb/>
            mothers of those who were drawn by lot; for they used <lb/>
            continually to bring their children food. Also, old tales <lb/>
            are told, because these women used to tell their children <lb/>
            such ones, to encourage and amuse them.</p>
          <p>These things are related by the historian Demus. <lb/>
            Moreover, a sacred enclosure was dedicated to Theseus, <lb/>
            and those families out of whom the tribute of the children <lb/>
            had been gathered were bidden to contribute to sacrifices <lb/>
            to him. These sacrifices were presided over by the <lb/>
            Phytalidæ, which post Theseus bestowed upon them as a <lb/>
            recompense for their hospitality towards him.</p>
          <p>XXIV. After the death of Ægeus, Theseus conceived a <lb/>
            great and important design. He gathered together all <lb/>
            the inhabitants of Attica and made them citizens of one <lb/>
            city, whereas before they had lived dispersed, so as to be <lb/>
            hard to assemble together for the common weal, and at <lb/>
            times even fighting with one another.</p>
          <p>He visited all the villages and tribes, and won their <lb/>
            consent; the poor and lower classes gladly accepting his <lb/>
            proposals, while he gained over the more powerful by <lb/>
            promising that the new constitution should not include a <lb/>
            king, but that it should be a pure commonwealth, with <lb/>
            himself merely acting as general of its army and guardian <lb/>
            of its laws, while in other respects it would allow perfect <lb/>
            freedom and equality to every one. By these arguments <lb/>
            he convinced some of them, and the rest knowing his <lb/>
            power and courage chose rather to be persuaded than <lb/>
            forced into compliance. He therefore destroyed the pry­ <lb/>
            taneia, the senate house, and the magistracy of each <lb/>
            individual township, built one common prytaneum and <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            senate house for them all on the site of the present <lb/>
            acropolis, called the city Athens, and instituted the <lb/>
            Panathenaic festival common to all of them. He also <lb/>
            instituted a festival for the resident aliens, on the six­ <lb/>
            teenth of the month, Hekatombeion, which is still kept <lb/>
            up. And having, according to his promise, laid down his <lb/>
            sovereign power, he arranged the new constitution under <lb/>
            the auspices of the gods ; for he made inquiry at Delphi <lb/>
            as to how he should deal with the city, and received the <lb/>
            following answer: <lb/>
            “ Thou son of Ægeus and of Pittheus’ maid, <lb/>
            My father hath within thy city laid <lb/>
            The bounds of many cities ; weigh not down <lb/>
            Thy soul with thought; the bladder cannot drown."</p>
          <p>The same thing they say was afterwards prophesied by <lb/>
            the Sibyl concerning the city, in these words : <lb/>
            " The bladder may be dipped, but cannot drown."</p>
          <p>XXV. Wishing still further to increase the number of <lb/>
            his citizens, he invited all strangers to come and share <lb/>
            equal privileges, and they say that the words now used, <lb/>
            " Come hither all ye peoples," was the proclamation then <lb/>
            used by Theseus, establishing as it were a commonwealth <lb/>
            of all natiors. But he did not permit his state to fall <lb/>
            into the disorder which this influx of all kinds of people <lb/>
            would probably have produced, but divided the people into <lb/>
            three classes, of Eupatridæ or nobles, Geomori or farmers, <lb/>
            Demiurgi or artisans. To the Eupatridæ he assigned the <lb/>
            care of religious rites, the supply of magistrates for the <lb/>
            city, and the interpretation of the laws and customs sacred <lb/>
            or profane, yet he placed them on an equality with the <lb/>
            other citizens, thinking that the nobles would always excel <lb/>
            in dignity, the farmers in usefulness, and the artisans in <lb/>
            numbers. Aristotle tells us that he was the first who <lb/>
            inclined to democracy, and gave up the title of king ; and <lb/>
            Homer seems to confirm this view by speaking of the <lb/>
            people of the Athenians alone of all the states men­ <lb/>
            tioned in his catalogue of ships. Theseus also struck <lb/>
            money with the figure of a bull, either alluding to the <lb/>
            bull of Marathon, or Taurus, Minos' general, or else to <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            encourage farming among the citizens. Hence they say <lb/>
            came the words, " worth ten," or " worth a hundred oxen." <lb/>
            He permanently annexed Megara to Attica, and set up the <lb/>
            famous pillar on the Isthmus, on which he wrote the <lb/>
            distinction between the countries in two trimeter lines, of <lb/>
            which the one looking east says, <lb/>
            “ This is not Peloponnesus, but Ionia, <lb/>
            and the one looking west says, <lb/>
            “ This is Peloponnesus, not Ionia." <lb/>
            And also he instituted games there, in emulation of <lb/>
            Herakles; that, just as Herakles had ordained that the <lb/>
            Greeks should celebrate the Olympic games in honour <lb/>
            of Zeus, so by Theseus's appointment they should celebrate <lb/>
            the Isthmian games in honour of Poseidon.</p>
          <p>The festival which was previously established there in <lb/>
            honour of Melikerta used to be celebrated by night, and to <lb/>
            be more like a religious mystery than a great spectacle and <lb/>
            gathering. Some writers assert that the Isthmian games <lb/>
            were established in honour of Skeiron, and that Theseus <lb/>
            wished to make them an atonement for the murder of his <lb/>
            kinsman; for Skeiron was the son of Kanethus and of <lb/>
            Henioche the daughter of Pittheus. Others say that this <lb/>
            festival was established in honour of Sinis, not of Skeiron. <lb/>
            Be this as it may, Theseus established it, and stipulated <lb/>
            with the Corinthians that visitors from Athens who came <lb/>
            to the games should have a seat of honour in as large a space <lb/>
            as could be covered by a sail of the public ship which <lb/>
            carried them, when stretched out on the ground. This <lb/>
            we are told by Hellanikus and Andron of Halikarnassus.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Besides this, according to Philochorus and other <lb/>
            writers, he sailed with Herakles to the Euxine, took part <lb/>
            in the campaign against the Amazons, and received <lb/>
            Antiope as the reward for his valour; but most historians, <lb/>
            among whom are Pherekydes, Hellanikus, and Herodorus, <lb/>
            say that Theseus made an expedition of his own later than <lb/>
            that of Herakles, and that he took the Amazon captive, <lb/>
            which is a more reasonable story. For no one of his <lb/>
            companions is said to have captured an Amazon; while <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            Bion relates that he caught this one by treachery and <lb/>
            carried her off; for the Amazons, he says, were not averse <lb/>
            to men, and did not avoid Theseus when he touched at <lb/>
            their coast, but even offered him presents. He invited <lb/>
            the bearer of these on board his ship ; and when she had <lb/>
            embarked he set sail. But one, Menekrates, who has <lb/>
            written a history of the town of Nikæa in Bithynia, states <lb/>
            that Theseus spent a long time in that country with <lb/>
            Antiope, and that there were three young Athenians, <lb/>
            brothers, who were his companions in arms, by name <lb/>
            Euneon, Thoas, and Soloeis. Soloeis fell in love with <lb/>
            Antiope, and, without telling his brothers, confided his <lb/>
            passion to one of his comrades. This man laid the mat­ <lb/>
            ter before Antiope, who firmly rejected his pretensions, <lb/>
            but treated him quietly and discreetly, telling Theseus <lb/>
            nothing about it. Soloeis, in despair at his rejection, <lb/>
            leaped into a river and perished; and Theseus then at <lb/>
            length learned the cause of the young man's death. In <lb/>
            his sorrow he remembered and applied to himself an <lb/>
            oracle he had received from Delphi. It had been enjoined <lb/>
            upon him by the Pythia that whenever he should be <lb/>
            struck down with special sorrow in a foreign land, <lb/>
            he should found a city in that place and leave some of <lb/>
            his companions there as its chiefs. In consequence of <lb/>
            this the city which he founded was called Pythopolis, in <lb/>
            honour of the Pythian Apollo, and the neighbouring river <lb/>
            was called Soloeis, after the youth who died in it. He <lb/>
            left there the brothers of Soloeis as the chiefs and law­ <lb/>
            givers of the new city, and together, with them one <lb/>
            Hermus, an Athenian Eupatrid. In consequence of this, <lb/>
            the people of Pythopolis call a certain place in thoir city <lb/>
            the house of Hermes, by a mistaken accentuation transfer­ <lb/>
            ring the honour due to their founder, to their god Hermes.</p>
          <p>XXVII. This was the origin of the war with the <lb/>
            Amazons; and it seems to have been carried on in no <lb/>
            feeble or womanish spirit, for they never could have <lb/>
            encamped in the city nor have fought a battle close to <lb/>
            the Pnyx and the Museum unless they had conquered the <lb/>
            rest of the country, so as to be able to approach the city <lb/>
            safely. It is hard to believe, as Hellanikus relates, that <lb/>
            they crossed the Cimmerian Bosphorus on the ice; but <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            that they encamped almost in the city is borne witness <lb/>
            to by the local names, and by the tombs of the fallen. <lb/>
            For a long time both parties held aloof, unwilling to <lb/>
            engage; but at last Theseus, after sacrificing to Phobos <lb/>
            (Fear), attacked them. The battle took place in the <lb/>
            month Boedromion, on the day on which the Athenians <lb/>
            celebrate the feast Boedromia. Kleidemus gives us accurate <lb/>
            details, stating that the left wing of the Amazons stood <lb/>
            at the place now called the Amazoneum, while the right <lb/>
            reached up to the Pnyx, at the place where the gilded <lb/>
            figure of Victory now stands. The Athenians attacked <lb/>
            them on this side, issuing from the Museum, and the <lb/>
            tombs of the fallen are to be seen along the street <lb/>
            which leads to the gate near the shrine of the hero <lb/>
            Chalkodus, which is called the Peiræic gate. On this side <lb/>
            the women forced them back as far as the temple of the <lb/>
            Eumenides, but on the other side those who assailed them <lb/>
            from the temple of Pallas, Ardettus, and the Lyceum, <lb/>
            drove their right wing in confusion back to their camp <lb/>
            with great slaughter. In the fourth month of the war <lb/>
            a peace was brought about by Hippolyte; for this writer <lb/>
            names the wife of Theseus Hippolyte, not Antiope. Some <lb/>
            relate that she was slain fighting by the side of Theseus <lb/>
            by a javelin hurled by one Molpadia, and that the column <lb/>
            which stands beside the temple of Olympian Earth is <lb/>
            sacred to her memory. It is not to be wondered at that <lb/>
            history should be at fault when dealing with such ancient <lb/>
            events as these, for there is another story at variance <lb/>
            with this, to the effect that Antiope caused the wounded <lb/>
            Amazons to be secretly transported to Chalkis, where they <lb/>
            were taken care of, and some of them were buried there, <lb/>
            at what is now called the Amazoneum. However, it is <lb/>
            a proof of the war having ended in a treaty of peace, that <lb/>
            the place near the temple of Theseus where they swore <lb/>
            to observe it, is still called Horcomosium, and that the <lb/>
            sacrifice to the Amazons always has taken place before the <lb/>
            festival of Theseus. The people of Megara also show a <lb/>
            burying-place of the Amazons, as one goes from the <lb/>
            market-place to what they call Rhus, where the lozenge­ <lb/>
            shaped building stands. It is said that some others died <lb/>
            at Chaeronea, and were buried bv the little stream which <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            it seems was anciently called Thermodon, but now is <lb/>
            called Hæmon, about which we have treated in the life <lb/>
            of Demosthenes. It would appear that the Amazons <lb/>
            did not even get across Thessaly without trouble, for <lb/>
            graves of them are shown to this day at Skotussa and <lb/>
            Kynoskephalæ.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. The above is all that is worthy of mention <lb/>
            about the Amazons ; for, as to the story which the author <lb/>
            of the ‘ Theseid' relates about this attack of the Amazons <lb/>
            being brought about by Antiope to revenge herself upon <lb/>
            Theseus for his marriage with Phædra, and how she and <lb/>
            her Amazons fought, and how Herakles slew them, all this <lb/>
            is clearly fabulous. After the death of Antiope, Theseus <lb/>
            married Phædra, having a son by Antiope named Hip­ <lb/>
            polytus, or Demophoon, according to Pindar. As for his <lb/>
            misfortunes with this wife and son, as the account given <lb/>
            by historians does not differ from that which appears in <lb/>
            the plays of the tragic poets, we must believe them to <lb/>
            have happened as all these writers say.</p>
          <p>XXIX. However, there are certain other legends about <lb/>
            Theseus' marriage which have never appeared on the <lb/>
            stage, which have neither a creditable beginning nor a <lb/>
            prosperous termination: for it is said that he carried off <lb/>
            one Anaxo, a Trcezenian girl, and after slaying Sinis and <lb/>
            Kerkyon he forced their daughters, and that he married <lb/>
            Periboea the mother of Ajax and also Pherebcea and lope <lb/>
            the daughter of Iphikles : and, as has been told already, <lb/>
            it was on account of his love for Ægle the daughter of <lb/>
            Panopeus that he deserted Ariadne, which was a shameful <lb/>
            and discreditable action. And in addition to all this he <lb/>
            is charged with carrying off Helen, which brought war <lb/>
            upon Attica, and exile and destruction on himself; about <lb/>
            which we shall speak presently. But, though many <lb/>
            adventures were undertaken by the heroes of those times, <lb/>
            Herodorus is of opinion that Theseus took no part in any <lb/>
            of them, except with the Lapithae in their fight with the <lb/>
            Centaurs; though other writers say that he went to <lb/>
            Kolchis with Jason and took part with Meleager in the <lb/>
            hunt of the Kalydonian boar.</p>
          <p>From these legends arises the proverb, “ Not with­ <lb/>
            out Theseus;” also he by himself without any comrades <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            performed many glorious deeds, from which the saying <lb/>
            came into vogue, " This is another Herakles."</p>
          <p>Theseus, together with Adrastus, effected the recovery <lb/>
            of the bodies of those who fell under the walls of the <lb/>
            Cadmea at Thebes, not after conquering the Thebans, as <lb/>
            Euripides puts it in his play, but by a truce and conven­ <lb/>
            tion, according to most writers. Philochorus even states <lb/>
            that this was the first occasion on which a truce was made <lb/>
            for the recovery of those slain in battle. But we have <lb/>
            shown in our ‘ Life of Herakles' that he was the first to <lb/>
            restore the corpses of the slain to the enemy. The tombs <lb/>
            of the rank and file are to be seen at Eleutheræ, but those <lb/>
            of the chiefs at Eleusis, by favour of Theseus to Adrastus. <lb/>
            Euripides's play of the ‘ Suppliants' is contradicted by <lb/>
            that of AEschylus, the ‘ Eleusinians,' in which Theseus is <lb/>
            introduced giving orders for this to be done.</p>
          <p>XXX. His friendship for Peirithous is said to have <lb/>
            arisen in the following manner : He had a great reputa­ <lb/>
            tion for strength and courage; Peirithous, wishing to <lb/>
            make trial of these, drove his cattle away from the plain of <lb/>
            Marathon, and when he learned that Theseus was pursu­ <lb/>
            ing them, armed, he did not retire, but turned and faced <lb/>
            him. Each man then admiring the beauty and courage of <lb/>
            his opponent, refrained from battle, and first Peirithous <lb/>
            holding out his hand bade Theseus himself assess the <lb/>
            damages of his raid upon the cattle, saying that he himself <lb/>
            would willingly submit to whatever penalty the other <lb/>
            might inflict. Theseus thought no more of their quarrel, <lb/>
            and invited him to become his friend and comrade; and <lb/>
            they ratified their compact of friendship by an oath. <lb/>
            Hereupon, Peirithous, who was about to marry Deidameia, <lb/>
            begged Theseus to come and visit his country and meet <lb/>
            the Lapithæ. He also had invited the Centaurs to the <lb/>
            banquet; and as they in their drunken insolence laid <lb/>
            hands upon the women, the Lapithæ attacked them. <lb/>
            Some of them they slew, and the rest they overcame, and <lb/>
            afterwards, with the assistance of Theseus, banished from <lb/>
            their country. Herodorus, however, says that this is not <lb/>
            how these events took place, but that the war was going <lb/>
            on, and that Theseus went to help the Lapithæ and while <lb/>
            on his way thither first beheld Herakles, whom he made <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            a point of visiting at Trachis, where he was resting aftei <lb/>
            his labours and wanderings; and that they met with <lb/>
            many compliments and much good feeling on both sides. <lb/>
            But one would more incline to those writers who tell us <lb/>
            that they often met, and that Herakles was initiated by <lb/>
            Theseus's desire, and was also purified before initiation at <lb/>
            his instance, which ceremony was necessary because of <lb/>
            some reckless action.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Theseus was fifty years old, according to <lb/>
            Hellanikus, when he carried off Helen, who was a mere <lb/>
            child. For this reason some who wish to clear him of <lb/>
            this, the heaviest of all the charges against him, say that <lb/>
            it was not he who carried off Helen, but that Idas and <lb/>
            Lynkeus carried her off and deposited her in his keeping. <lb/>
            Afterwards the Twin Brethren came and demanded her <lb/>
            back, but he would not give her up; or even it is said <lb/>
            that Tyndareus himself handed her over to him, because <lb/>
            he feared that Enarsphorus the son of Hippocoon would <lb/>
            take her by force, she being only a child at the time. <lb/>
            But the most probable story and that which most writers <lb/>
            agree in is the following: The two friends, Theseus and <lb/>
            Peirithous, came to Sparta, seized the maiden, who was <lb/>
            dancing in the temple of Artemis Orthia, and carried her <lb/>
            off. As the pursuers followed no farther than Tegea, <lb/>
            they felt no alarm, but leisurely travelled through <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, and made a compact that whichever of them <lb/>
            should win Helen by lot was to have her to wife, but <lb/>
            must help the other to a marriage. They cast lots on this <lb/>
            understanding, and Theseus won. As the maiden was <lb/>
            not yet ripe for marriage he took her with him to <lb/>
            Aphidnæ, and there placing his mother with her gave <lb/>
            her into the charge of his friend Aphidnus, bidding him <lb/>
            watch over her and keep her presence secret. He himself <lb/>
            in order to repay his obligation to Peirithous went on a <lb/>
            journey with him to Epirus to obtain the daughter of <lb/>
            Aidoneus the king of the Molossians, who called his wife <lb/>
            Persephone, his daughter Kore, and his clog Cerberus. <lb/>
            All the suitors of his daughter were bidden by him to <lb/>
            fight this dog, and the victor was to receive her hand. <lb/>
            However, as he learned that Peirithous and his friend <lb/>
            were come, not as wooers, but as ravishers, he cast them <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            into prison. He put an end to Peirithous at once, by <lb/>
            means of his dog, but only guarded Theseus strictly.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Now at this period Mnestheus, the son of <lb/>
            Peteus, who was the son of Omeus, who was the son of <lb/>
            Erechtheus, first of all mankind they say took to the arts <lb/>
            of a demagogue, and to currying favour with the people. <lb/>
            This man formed a league of the nobles, who had long <lb/>
            borne Theseus a grudge for having destroyed the local <lb/>
            jurisdiction and privileges of each of the Eupatrids by <lb/>
            collecting them all together into the capital, where they <lb/>
            were no more than his subjects and slaves; and he also <lb/>
            excited the common people by telling them that although <lb/>
            they were enjoying a fancied freedom they really had been <lb/>
            deprived of their ancestral privileges and sacred rites, and <lb/>
            made to endure the rule of one foreign despot, instead of <lb/>
            that of many good kings of their own blood.</p>
          <p>While he was thus busily employed, the invasion of <lb/>
            Attica by the sons of Tyndareus greatly assisted his <lb/>
            revolutionary scheme; so that some say that it was he <lb/>
            who invited them to come. At first they abstained from <lb/>
            violence, and confined themselves to asking that their <lb/>
            sister Helen should be given up to them ; but when they <lb/>
            were told by the citizens that she was not in their hands, <lb/>
            and that they knew not where she was, they proceeded to <lb/>
            warlike measures. Akademus, who had by some means <lb/>
            discovered that she was concealed at Aphidnae, now told <lb/>
            them where she was; for which cause he was honoured <lb/>
            by the sons of Tyndareus during his life, and also the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, though they often invaded the country <lb/>
            and ravaged it unsparingly, yet never touched the place <lb/>
            called the Akademeia, for Akademus's sake. Dikæarchus <lb/>
            says that Echemus and Marathus, two Arcadians, took <lb/>
            part in that war with the sons of Tyndareus; and that from <lb/>
            the first the place now called Akademeia was then named <lb/>
            Echedemia, and that from the second the township of <lb/>
            Marathon takes its names, because he in accordance with <lb/>
            some oracle voluntarily offered himself as a sacrifice there <lb/>
            in the sight of the whole army.</p>
          <p>However, the sons of Tyndareus came to Aphidnæ, and <lb/>
            took the place after a battle, in which it is said that <lb/>
            Alykus fell, the son of Skeiron, who then was fighting on <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            the side of the Dioskuri. In memory of this man it is <lb/>
            said that the place in the territory of Megara where his <lb/>
            remains lie is called Alykus. But Hereas writes that <lb/>
            Alykus was slain by Theseus at Aphidnæ, and as evidence <lb/>
            he quotes this verse about Alykus, <lb/>
            “ Him whom Theseus slew in the spacious streets of Aphidnæ, <lb/>
            Fighting for fair-haired Helen." <lb/>
            But it is not likely that if Theseus had been there, his <lb/>
            mother and the town of Aphidnæ would have been taken.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. After the fall of Aphidnæ, the people of Athens <lb/>
            became terrified, and were persuaded by Mnestheus to admit <lb/>
            the sons of Tyndareus to the city, and to treat them as friends, <lb/>
            because, he said, they were only at war with Theseus, who <lb/>
            had been the first to use violence, and were the saviours <lb/>
            and benefactors of the rest of mankind. These words of <lb/>
            his were confirmed by their behaviour, for, victorious as <lb/>
            they were, they yet demanded nothing except initiation <lb/>
            into the mysteries, as they were, no less than Herakles, <lb/>
            connected with the city. This was permitted them, and <lb/>
            they were adopted by Aphidnus, as Herakles had been by <lb/>
            Pylius. They received divine honours, being addressed as <lb/>
            " Anakes," either because of the cessation of the war, or <lb/>
            from the care they took, when they had such a large army <lb/>
            within the walls of Athens, that no one should be wronged ; <lb/>
            for those who take care of or guard anything are said to <lb/>
            do it " anakos," and perhaps for this reason kings are called <lb/>
            “ Anaktes." Some say that they were called Anakas <lb/>
            because of the appearance of their stars in the heavens <lb/>
            above, for the Attics called " above " “ anekas."</p>
          <p>XXXIV. It is said that Æthra, the mother of Theseus, <lb/>
            was carried off as a captive to Lacedæmon, and thence to <lb/>
            Troy with Helen, and Homer supports this view, when he <lb/>
            says that there followed Helen, <lb/>
            " Aithra the daughter of Pittheus and large-eyed Klymene." <lb/>
            Others reject this verse, and the legend about Mounychus, <lb/>
            who is said to have been the bastard son of Laodike, by <lb/>
            Demophoon, and to have been brought up in Troy by <lb/>
            Aithra. But Istrus, in his thirteenth book of his ‘ History <lb/>
            of Attica,' tells quite a different and peculiar story about <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            Aithra, that he had heard that Paris was conquered by <lb/>
            Achilles and Patroklus near the river Spercheius, in <lb/>
            Thessaly, and that Hector took the city of Troezen by <lb/>
            storm, and amongst the plunder carried off Aithra, who <lb/>
            had been left there. But this seems impossible.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Now Aidoneus the Molossian king chanced to <lb/>
            be entertaining Herakles, and related to him the story of <lb/>
            Theseus and Peirithous, what they had intended to do, <lb/>
            and how they had been caught in the act and punished. <lb/>
            Herakles was much grieved at hearing how one had <lb/>
            perished ingloriously, and the other was like to perish. <lb/>
            He thought that nothing would be gained by reproaching <lb/>
            the king for his conduct to Peirithous, but he begged for <lb/>
            the life of Theseus, and pointed out that the release of his <lb/>
            friend was a favour which he deserved. Aidoneus agreed, <lb/>
            and Theseus, when set free, returned to Athens, where he <lb/>
            found that his party was not yet overpowered. Whatever <lb/>
            consecrated grounds had been set apart for him by the city, <lb/>
            he dedicated to Herakles, and called Heraklea instead of <lb/>
            Thesea, except four, according to Philochorus. But, as he <lb/>
            at once wished to preside and manage the state as before, <lb/>
            he was met by factious opposition, for he found that those <lb/>
            who had been his enemies before, had now learned not to <lb/>
            fear him, while the common people had become corrupted, <lb/>
            and now required to be specially flattered instead of doing <lb/>
            their duty in silence.</p>
          <p>He endeavoured to establish his government by force, <lb/>
            but was overpowered by faction; and at last, despairing <lb/>
            of success, he secretly sent his children to Eubœa, to <lb/>
            Elephenor, the son of Chalkodous; and he himself, after <lb/>
            solemnly uttering curses on the Athenians at Gargettus,' <lb/>
            where now is the place called Araterion, or the place of <lb/>
            curses, set sail for Skyros, where he was, he imagined, on <lb/>
            friendly terms with the inhabitants, and possessed a <lb/>
            paternal estate in the island. At that time Lykomedes <lb/>
            was king of Skyros; so he proceeded to demand from him <lb/>
            his lands, in order to live there, though some say that he <lb/>
            asked him to assist him against the Athenians. Lyko­ <lb/>
            medes, either in fear of the great reputation of Theseus, <lb/>
            or else to gain the favour of Mnestheus, led him up to <lb/>
            the highest mountain top in the country, on the pretext <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            of showing him his estate from thence, and pushed him <lb/>
            over a precipice. Some say that he stumbled and fell <lb/>
            of himself, as he was walking after supper, according <lb/>
            to his custom. As soon as he was dead, no one thought <lb/>
            any more of him, but Mnestheus reigned over the <lb/>
            Athenians, while Theseus's children were brought up as <lb/>
            private citizens by Elephenor, and followed him to <lb/>
            Ilium. When Mnestheus died at Ilium, they returned <lb/>
            home and resumed their rightful sovereignty. In sub­ <lb/>
            sequent times, among many other things which led the <lb/>
            Athenians to honour Theseus as a hero or demi-god, most <lb/>
            remarkable was his appearance at the battle of Marathon, <lb/>
            where his spirit was seen by many, clad in armour, lead­ <lb/>
            ing the charge against the barbarians.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. After the Persian war, in the archonship of <lb/>
            Phædo, the Athenians were told by the Delphian Oracle <lb/>
            to take home the bones of Theseus and keep them with <lb/>
            the greatest care and honour. There was great difficulty <lb/>
            in obtaining them and in discovering his tomb, on account <lb/>
            of the wild and savage habits of the natives of the island. <lb/>
            However, Kimon took the island, as is written in my <lb/>
            history of his Life, and making it a point of honour to dis­ <lb/>
            cover his tomb, he chanced to behold an eagle pecking <lb/>
            with its beak and scratching with its talons at a small <lb/>
            rising ground. Here he dug, imagining that the spot had <lb/>
            been pointed out by a miracle. There was found the coffin <lb/>
            of a man of great stature, and lying beside it a brazen <lb/>
            lance-head and a sword. These relics were brought to <lb/>
            Athens by Kimon, on board of his trireme, and the de­ <lb/>
            lighted Athenians received them with splendid processions <lb/>
            and sacrifices, just as if the hero himself were come to the <lb/>
            city. He is buried in the midst of the city, near where <lb/>
            the Gymnasium now stands, and his tomb is a place of <lb/>
            sanctuary for slaves, and all that are poor and oppressed, <lb/>
            because Theseus, during his life, was the champion and <lb/>
            avenger of the poor, and always kindly hearkened to their <lb/>
            prayers. Their greatest sacrifice in his honour takes <lb/>
            place on the eighth of the month of Pyanepsion, upon <lb/>
            which day he and the youths came back from Crete. But <lb/>
            besides this they hold a service in his honour on the eighth <lb/>
            of all the other months, either because it was on the <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            eighth day of Hekatombeion that he first arrived in Athens <lb/>
            from Troezen, as is related by Diodorus the topographer, <lb/>
            or else thinking that number to be especially his own, <lb/>
            because he is said to have been the son of Poseidon, and <lb/>
            Poseidon is honoured on the eighth day of every month. <lb/>
            For the number eight is the first cube of an even number, <lb/>
            and is double the first square, and therefore peculiarly <lb/>
            represents the immovable abiding power of that god whom <lb/>
            we address as " the steadfast," and the “ earth upholder.”</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF ROMULUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>HISTORIANS are not agreed upon the origin and meaning of <lb/>
            the famous name of Rome, which is so celebrated through <lb/>
            all the world. Some relate that the Pelasgi, after wander­ <lb/>
            ing over the greater part of the world, and conquering <lb/>
            most nations, settled there, and gave the city its name <lb/>
            from their own strength in battle.- Others tell us that <lb/>
            after the capture of Troy some fugitives obtained ships, <lb/>
            were carried by the winds to the Tyrrhenian or Tuscan <lb/>
            coast, and cast anchor in the Tiber. There the women, who <lb/>
            had suffered much from the sea voyage, were advised by <lb/>
            one who was accounted chief among them for wisdom and <lb/>
            noble birth, Roma by name, to burn the ships. At first the <lb/>
            men were angry at this, but afterwards, being compelled <lb/>
            to settle round about the Palatine Hill, they fared better <lb/>
            than they expected, as they found the country fertile and <lb/>
            the neighbours hospitable; so they paid great honour to <lb/>
            Roma, and called the city after her name. From this <lb/>
            circumstance, they say, arose the present habit of women <lb/>
            kissing their male relatives and connections; because <lb/>
            those women, after they had burned the ships, thus <lb/>
            embraced and caressed the men, trying to pacify their <lb/>
            rage.</p>
          <p>II. Some say that Roma, who gave the name to the <lb/>
            city, was the daughter of Italus and Leucaria, or of <lb/>
            Telephus the son of Hercules, and the wife of iEneas, <lb/>
            while others say that she was the daughter of Ascanius <lb/>
            the son of Æneas. Others relate that Romanus, the son <lb/>
            of Odysseus and Circe, founded the city, or that it was <lb/>
            Romus, the son of Hemathion, who was sent from Troy by <lb/>
            Diomedes; or Romis the despot of the Latins, who drove <note type="footnote"> * The Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥώμη</foreign> = strength. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            out of his kingdom the Tyrrhenians, who, starting from <lb/>
            Thessaly, had made their way to Lydia, and thence to <lb/>
            Italy. And even those who follow the most reasonable of <lb/>
            these legends, and admit that it was Romulus who founded <lb/>
            the city after his own name, do not agree about his birth; <lb/>
            for some say that he was the son of Æneas and Dexithea <lb/>
            the daughter of Phorbas, and with his brother Romus <lb/>
            was brought to Italy when a child, and that as the river <lb/>
            was in flood, all the other boats were swamped, but that <lb/>
            in which the children were was carried to a soft bank and <lb/>
            miraculously preserved, from which the name of Rome <lb/>
            was given to the place. Others say that Roma, the <lb/>
            daughter of that Trojan lady, married Latinus the son of <lb/>
            Telemachus and bore a son, Romulus; while others say <lb/>
            that his mother was Æmilia the daughter of Æneas and <lb/>
            Lavinia, by an intrigue with Mars; while others give a <lb/>
            completely legendary account of his birth, as follows :</p>
          <p>In the house of Tarchetius, the king of the Albani, a <lb/>
            cruel and lawless man, a miracle took place. A male <lb/>
            figure arose from the hearth, and remained there for many <lb/>
            days. Now there was in Etruria an oracle of Tethys, <lb/>
            which told Tarchetius that a virgin must be offered to the <lb/>
            figure ; for there should be born of her a son surpassing all <lb/>
            mankind in strength, valour, and good fortune. Tarchetius <lb/>
            hereupon explained the oracle to one of his daughters, and <lb/>
            ordered her to. give herself up to the figure ; but she, not <lb/>
            liking to do so, sent her servant-maid instead. Tarchetius, <lb/>
            when he learned this, was greatly incensed, and cast them <lb/>
            both into prison, meaning to put them to death. However, <lb/>
            in a dream, Vesta appeared to him, forbidding him to slay <lb/>
            them. In consequence of this he locked them up with a <lb/>
            loom, telling them that when they had woven the piece <lb/>
            of work upon it they should be married. So they wove <lb/>
            all day, and during the night other maidens sent by <lb/>
            Tarchetius undid their work again. Now when the <lb/>
            servant-maid was delivered of twins, Tarchetius gave <lb/>
            them to one Teratius, and bade him destroy them. He <lb/>
            laid them down near the river; and there they were <lb/>
            suckled by a she-wolf, while all sorts of birds brought <lb/>
            them morsels of food, until one day a cowherd saw them. <lb/>
            Filled with wonder he ventured to come up to the children <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            and bear them off. Saved from death in this manner they <lb/>
            grew up, and then attacked and slew Tarchetius. This <lb/>
            is the legend given by one Promathion, the compiler of <lb/>
            a history of Italy.</p>
          <p>III. But the most credible story, and that has most <lb/>
            vouchers for its truth, is that which was first published in <lb/>
            Greece by Dickies of Peparethos, a writer whom Fabius <lb/>
            Pictor has followed in most points. There are variations <lb/>
            in this legend also; but, generally speaking, it runs as <lb/>
            follows:</p>
          <p>The dynasty established by Æneas at Alba Longa, <lb/>
            came down to two brothers, Numitor and Amulius. <lb/>
            Amulius offered his brother the choice between the <lb/>
            sovereign power and the royal treasure, including the <lb/>
            gold brought from Troy. Numitor chose the sovereign <lb/>
            power. But Amulius, possessing all the treasure, and <lb/>
            thereby having more power than his brother, easily <lb/>
            dethroned him, and, as he feared his brother's daughter <lb/>
            might have children who would avenge him, he made her <lb/>
            a priestess of Vesta, sworn to celibacy for ever. This <lb/>
            lady is named by some Ilia, by others Rhea or Silvia. <lb/>
            After no long time she was found to be with child, against <lb/>
            the law of the Vestals. Her life was saved by the entreaties <lb/>
            of Antho, the king's daughter, but she was closely im­ <lb/>
            prisoned, that she might not be delivered without Amulius's <lb/>
            knowledge. She bore two children of remarkable beauty <lb/>
            and size, and Amulius, all the more alarmed at this, bade <lb/>
            an attendant take them and expose them. Some say that <lb/>
            this man's name was Faustulus, while others say that this <lb/>
            was not his name, but that of their rescuer. However, he <lb/>
            placed the infants in a cradle, and went down to the river <lb/>
            with the intention of throwing them into it, but seeing it <lb/>
            running strong and turbulently, he feared to approach it, <lb/>
            laid down the cradle near the bank and went away. <lb/>
            The river, which was in flood, rose, and gently floated off <lb/>
            the cradle, and carried it down to a soft place which is <lb/>
            now called Cermalus, but anciently, it seems, was called <lb/>
            Germanus, because brothers are called germani.</p>
          <p>IV. Near this place was a fig-tree, which they called <lb/>
            Ruminalius, either from Romulus, as most persons imagine, <lb/>
            or because cattle came to ruminate in its shade, or, more <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            probably, because of the suckling of the children there, <lb/>
            for the ancients called the nipple rouma. Moreover, they <lb/>
            call the goddess who appears to have watched over the <lb/>
            children Roumilia, and to her they sacrifice offerings <lb/>
            without wine, and pour milk as a libation upon her altar.</p>
          <p>It is said that while the infants were lying in this <lb/>
            place, the she-wolf suckled them, and that a woodpecker <lb/>
            came and helped to feed and watch over them. Now these <lb/>
            animals are sacred to the god Mars; and the Latins have <lb/>
            a peculiar reverence and worship for the woodpecker. <lb/>
            These circumstances, therefore, did not a little to confirm <lb/>
            the tale of the mother of the children, that their fathei <lb/>
            was Mars, though some say that she was deceived by <lb/>
            Amulius himself, who, after condemning her to a life of <lb/>
            virginity, appeared before her dressed in armour, and <lb/>
            ravished her. Others say that the twofold meaning of <lb/>
            the name of their nurse gave rise to this legend, for the <lb/>
            Latins use the word lupa for she-wolves, and also for <lb/>
            unchaste women, as was the wife of Faustulus, who <lb/>
            brought up the children, Acca Laurentia by name. To <lb/>
            her also the Romans offer sacrifice, and in the month of <lb/>
            April the priest of Mars brings libations to her, and the <lb/>
            feast is called Laurentia.</p>
          <p>V. The Romans also worship another Laurentia, for <lb/>
            this reason: The priest of Hercules, weary with idleness, <lb/>
            proposed to the god to cast the dice on the condition that, <lb/>
            if he won, he should receive something good from the god, <lb/>
            while if he lost, he undertook to provide the god with a <lb/>
            bountiful feast and a fair woman to take his pleasure with. <lb/>
            Upon these conditions he cast the dice, first for the god, <lb/>
            and then for himself, and was beaten. Wishing to settle <lb/>
            his wager properly, and making a point of keeping his <lb/>
            word, he prepared a feast for the god, and hired Laurentia, <lb/>
            then in the pride of her beauty, though not yet famous. <lb/>
            He feasted her in the temple, where he had prepared a <lb/>
            couch, and after supper he locked her in, that the god <lb/>
            might possess her. And, indeed, the god is said to have <lb/>
            appeared to the lady, and to have bidden her go early in <lb/>
            the morning into the market-place, and to embrace the <lb/>
            first man she met, and make him her friend. There met <lb/>
            her a citizen far advanced in years, possessing a fair <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            income, childless, and unmarried. His name was Tarrutius. <lb/>
            He took Laurentia to himself, and loved her, and upon <lb/>
            his death left her heiress to a large and valuable property, <lb/>
            the greater part of which she left by will to the city. <lb/>
            It is related of her, that after she had become famous, and <lb/>
            was thought to enjoy the favour of Heaven, she vanished <lb/>
            near the very same spot where the other Laurentia lay <lb/>
            buried This place is now called Velabrum, because <lb/>
            during the frequent overflowings of the river, people used <lb/>
            there to be ferried over to the market-place; now they <lb/>
            call ferrying velatura. Some say that the road from the <lb/>
            market-place to the circus, starting from this point, used <lb/>
            to be covered with sails or awnings by those who treated <lb/>
            the people to a spectacle; and in the Latin tongue a sail <lb/>
            is called velum. This is why the second Laurentia is <lb/>
            honoured by the Romans.</p>
          <p>VI. Now Faustulus, the swineherd of Amulius, kept <lb/>
            the children concealed from every one, though some say <lb/>
            that Numitor knew of it, and shared the expense of their <lb/>
            education. They were sent to Gabii to learn their letters, <lb/>
            and everything else that well-born children should know; <lb/>
            and they were called Romulus and Remus, because they <lb/>
            were first seen sucking the wolf. Their noble birth <lb/>
            showed itself while they were yet children, in their size <lb/>
            and beauty; and when they grew up they were manly <lb/>
            and high-spirited, of invincible courage and daring. <lb/>
            Romulus, however, was thought the wiser and more <lb/>
            politic of the two, and in his discussions with the neigh­ <lb/>
            bours about pasture and hunting, gave them opportunities <lb/>
            of noting that his disposition was one which led him <lb/>
            to command rather than to obey. On account of these <lb/>
            qualities they were beloved by their equals and the poor, <lb/>
            but they despised the king's officers and bailiffs as being <lb/>
            no braver than themselves, and cared neither for their <lb/>
            anger nor their threats. They led the lives and followed <lb/>
            the pursuits of nobly born men, not valuing sloth and <lb/>
            idleness, but exercise and hunting, defending the land <lb/>
            against brigands, capturing plunderers, and avenging <lb/>
            those who had suffered wrong. And thus they became <lb/>
            famous.</p>
          <p>VII. Now a quarrel arose between the herdsmen of <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            Numitor and those of Amulius, and cattle were driven <lb/>
            off by the former. Amulius's men, enraged at this, fought <lb/>
            and routed the others, and recovered a great part of the <lb/>
            booty. They cared nothing for Numitor's anger, but <lb/>
            collected together many needy persons and slaves, and <lb/>
            filled them with a rebellious spirit. While Romulus was <lb/>
            absent at a sacrifice (for he was much addicted to sacrifices <lb/>
            and divination), the herdsmen of Numitor fell in with <lb/>
            Remus, accompanied by a small band, and fought with <lb/>
            him. After many wounds had been received on both <lb/>
            sides, Numitor's men conquered and took Remus alive. <lb/>
            Remus was brought before Numitor, who did not punish <lb/>
            him, as he feared his brother's temper, but went to his <lb/>
            brother and begged for justice, saying that he had suffered <lb/>
            wrong at the hands of the king his brother's servants. <lb/>
            As all the people of Alba sympathised with Remus, and <lb/>
            feared that he would be unjustly put to death, or worse, <lb/>
            Amulius, alarmed at them, handed over Remus to his <lb/>
            brother Numitor, to deal with as he pleased. Numitor <lb/>
            took him, and as soon as he reached home, after admiring <lb/>
            the bodily strength and stature of the youth, which <lb/>
            surpassed all the rest, perceiving in his looks his courageous <lb/>
            and fiery spirit, undismayed by his present circumstances, <lb/>
            and having heard that his deeds corresponded to his <lb/>
            appearance, and above all, as seems probable, some god <lb/>
            being with him and watching over the first beginnings <lb/>
            of great events, he was struck by the idea of asking him <lb/>
            to tell the truth as to who he was, and how he was born, <lb/>
            giving him confidence and encouragement by his kindly <lb/>
            voice and looks. The young man boldly said, “ I will <lb/>
            conceal nothing from you, for you seem more like a king <lb/>
            than Amulius. You hear and judge before you punish, <lb/>
            but he gives men up to be punished without a trial. <lb/>
            Formerly we (for we are twins) understood that we were <lb/>
            the sons of Faustulus and Laurentia, the king's servants; <lb/>
            but now that we are brought before you as culprits, and <lb/>
            are falsely accused and in danger of our lives, we have <lb/>
            heard great things about ourselves. Whether they be <lb/>
            true or not, we must now put to the test. Our birth is <lb/>
            said to be a secret, and our nursing and bringing up is <lb/>
            yet stranger, for we were cast out to the beasts and the <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            birds, and were fed by them, suckled by a she-wolf, and <lb/>
            fed with morsels of food by a woodpecker as we lay in <lb/>
            our cradle beside the great river. Our cradle still exists, <lb/>
            carefully preserved, bound with brazen bands, on which <lb/>
            is an indistinct inscription, which hereafter will serve as <lb/>
            a means by which we may be recognised by our parents, <lb/>
            but to no purpose if we are dead." Numitor, considering <lb/>
            the young man's story, and reckoning up the time from <lb/>
            his apparent age, willingly embraced the hope which was <lb/>
            dawning on his mind, and considered how he might obtain <lb/>
            a secret interview with his daughter and tell her of all <lb/>
            this; for she was still kept a close prisoner.</p>
          <p>VIII. Faustulus, when he heard of Remus being captured <lb/>
            and delivered up to Numitor, called upon Romulus to help <lb/>
            him, and told him plainly all about his birth; although <lb/>
            previously he had hinted so much, that any one who paid <lb/>
            attention to his words might have known nearly all about <lb/>
            it; and he himself with the cradle ran to Numitor full of <lb/>
            hopes and fears, now that matters had come to a critical <lb/>
            point. He was viewed with suspicion by the guards at <lb/>
            the king's gate, and while they were treating him con­ <lb/>
            temptuously, and confusing him by questions, they espied <lb/>
            the cradle under his cloak. Now it chanced that one of <lb/>
            them had been one of those who had taken the children to <lb/>
            cast them away, and had been present when they were <lb/>
            abandoned. This man, seeing the cradle and recognising <lb/>
            it by its make and the inscription on it, suspected the <lb/>
            truth, and at once told the king and brought the man in <lb/>
            to be examined. Faustulus, in these dire straits, did not <lb/>
            altogether remain unshaken, and yet did not quite allow <lb/>
            his secret to be wrung from him. He admitted that the <lb/>
            boys were alive, but said that they were living far away <lb/>
            from Alba, and that he himself was bringing the cradle to <lb/>
            Ilia, who had often longed to see and touch it to confirm <lb/>
            her belief in the life of her children. Now Amulius did <lb/>
            what men generally do when excited by fear or rage. He <lb/>
            sent in a great hurry one who was a good man and a <lb/>
            friend of Numitor, bidding him ask Numitor whether he <lb/>
            had heard anything about the survival of the children. <lb/>
            This man on arrival, finding Numitor all but embracing <lb/>
            Remus, confirmed his belief that he was his grandson, and <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            bade him take his measures quickly, remaining by him <lb/>
            himself to offer assistance. Even had they wished it, <lb/>
            there was no time for delay; for Romulus was already <lb/>
            near, and no small number of the citizens, through hatred <lb/>
            and fear of Amulius, were going out to join him. He <lb/>
            himself brought no small force, arrayed in companies of a <lb/>
            hundred each. Each of these was led by a man who <lb/>
            carried a bundle of sticks and straw upon a pole. The <lb/>
            Latins called these manipla; and from this these com­ <lb/>
            panies are even at the present day called maniples in <lb/>
            the Roman army. Now as Remus raised a revolt <lb/>
            within, while Romulus assailed the palace without, <lb/>
            the despot was captured and put to death without <lb/>
            having been able to do anything, or take any measures <lb/>
            for his own safety.</p>
          <p>The greater part of the above story is told by Fabius <lb/>
            Pictor and Dickies of Peparethos, who seem to have been <lb/>
            the first historians of the foundation of Rome. The story <lb/>
            is doubted by many on account of its theatrical and arti­ <lb/>
            ficial form, yet we ought not to disbelieve it when we <lb/>
            consider what wondrous works are wrought by chance, and <lb/>
            when, too, we reflect on the Roman Empire, which, had it <lb/>
            not had a divine origin, never could have arrived at its <lb/>
            present extent.</p>
          <p>IX. After the death of Amulius, and the reorganisation <lb/>
            of the kingdom, the twins, who would not live in Alba as <lb/>
            subjects, and did not wish to reign there during the life <lb/>
            of their grandfather, gave up the sovereign power to him, <lb/>
            and, having made a suitable provision for their mother, <lb/>
            determined to dwell by themselves, and to found a city in <lb/>
            the parts in which they themselves had been reared; at <lb/>
            least, this is the most probable of the various reasons <lb/>
            which are given. It may also have been necessary, as <lb/>
            many slaves and fugitives had gathered round them, <lb/>
            either that they should disperse these men and so lose <lb/>
            their entire power, or else go and dwell alone amongst <lb/>
            them. It is clear, from the rape of the Sabine women, <lb/>
            that the citizens of Alba would not admit these outcasts <lb/>
            into their own body, since that deed was caused, not by <lb/>
            wanton insolence, but by necessity, as they could not <lb/>
            obtain wives by fair means; for after carrying the women <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            off they treated them with the greatest respect. After­ <lb/>
            wards, when the city was once founded, they made it a <lb/>
            sanctuary for people in distress to take refuge in, saying <lb/>
            that it belonged to the god Asylus; and they received in <lb/>
            it all sorts of persons, not giving up slaves to their masters, <lb/>
            debtors to their creditors, or murderers to their judges, but <lb/>
            saying that, in accordance with a Pythian oracle, the <lb/>
            sanctuary was free to all; so that the city soon became <lb/>
            full of men, for they say that at first it contained no less <lb/>
            than a thousand hearths. Of this more hereafter. When <lb/>
            they were proceeding to found the city, they at once <lb/>
            quarrelled about its site. Romulus fixed upon what is <lb/>
            now called Roma Quadrata, a square piece of ground, and <lb/>
            wished the city to be built in that place ; but Remus pre­ <lb/>
            ferred a strong position on Mount Aventine, which, in <lb/>
            memory of him, was called the Remonium, and now is <lb/>
            called Rignarium.</p>
          <p>They agreed to decide their dispute by watching the <lb/>
            flight of birds, and having taken their seats apart, it is <lb/>
            said that six vultures appeared to Remus, and afterwards <lb/>
            twice as many to Romulus. Some say that Remus really <lb/>
            saw his vultures, but that Romulus only pretended to have <lb/>
            seen them, and when Remus came to him, then the twelve <lb/>
            appeared to Romulus; for which reason the Romans at <lb/>
            the present day draw their auguries especially from <lb/>
            vultures. Herodorus of Pontus says that Hercules de­ <lb/>
            lighted in the sight of a vulture, when about to do any <lb/>
            great action. It is the most harmless of all creatures, for <lb/>
            it injures neither crops, fruit, nor cattle, and lives entirely <lb/>
            upon dead corpses. It does not kill or injure anything <lb/>
            that has life, and even abstains from dead birds from its <lb/>
            relationship to them. Now eagles, and owls, and falcons, <lb/>
            peck and kill other birds, in spite of Æschylus's line, <lb/>
            " Bird-eating bird polluted e'er must be." <lb/>
            Moreover, the other birds are, so to speak, ever before our <lb/>
            eyes, and continually remind us of their presence; but the <lb/>
            vulture is seldom seen, and it is difficult to meet with its <lb/>
            young, which has suggested to some persons the strange <lb/>
            idea that vultures come from some other world to pay us <lb/>
            their rare visits. which are like those occurrences whicli. <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            according to the soothsayers, do not happen naturally or <lb/>
            spontaneously, but by the interposition of Heaven.</p>
          <p>X. When Remus discovered the deceit he was very <lb/>
            angry, and, while Romulus was digging a trench round <lb/>
            where the city wall was to be built, he jeered at the works, <lb/>
            and hindered them. At last, as he jumped over it, he was <lb/>
            struck dead either by Romulus himself, or by Celer, one of <lb/>
            his companions. In this fight, Faustulus was slain, and <lb/>
            also Pleistinus, who is said to have been Faustulus's brother <lb/>
            and to have helped him in rearing Romulus and his <lb/>
            brother. Celer retired into Tyrrhenia, and from him the <lb/>
            Romans call quick sharp men Celeres; Quintus Metellus, <lb/>
            who, when his father died, in a very few days exhibited a <lb/>
            show of gladiators, was surnamed Celer by the Romans <lb/>
            in their wonder at the short time he had spent in his <lb/>
            preparations.</p>
          <p>XI. Romulus, after burying Remus and his foster-parents <lb/>
            in the Remurium, consecrated his city, having fetched <lb/>
            men from Etruria, who taught him how to perform it <lb/>
            according to sacred rites and ceremonies, as though they <lb/>
            were celebrating holy mysteries. A trench was dug in a <lb/>
            circle round what is now the Comitium, and into it were <lb/>
            flung first-fruits of all those things which are honourable <lb/>
            and necessary for men. Finally each man brought a little <lb/>
            of the earth of the country from which he came, and flung <lb/>
            it into one heap and mixed it all together. They call this <lb/>
            pit by the same name as the heavens, Mundus. Next, they <lb/>
            drew the outline of the city in the form of a circle, with <lb/>
            this place as its centre.. And then the founder, having <lb/>
            fitted a plough with a brazen ploughshare, and yoked to it <lb/>
            a bull and a cow, himself ploughs a deep furrow round the <lb/>
            boundaries. It is the duty of his attendants to throw the <lb/>
            clods inwards, which the plough turns up, and to let none <lb/>
            of them fall outwards. By this line they define the ex­ <lb/>
            tent of the fortifications, and it is called by contraction, <lb/>
            Pomœrium, which means behind the walls or beyond the <lb/>
            walls (post mœnia). Wherever they intend to place a gate <lb/>
            they take off the ploughshare, and carry the plough <lb/>
            over, leaving a space. After this ceremony they con. <lb/>
            sider the entire wall sacred, except the gates; but if <lb/>
            they were sacred also, they oould not without scruple <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            bring in and out necessaries and unclean things through <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>XII. It is agreed that the foundation of the city took <lb/>
            place on the eleventh day before the Kalends of May (the <lb/>
            21st of April). And on this day the Romans keep a <lb/>
            festival which they call the birthday of the city. At this <lb/>
            feast, originally, we are told, they sacrificed nothing that <lb/>
            has life, but thought it right to keep the anniversary of <lb/>
            the birth of the city pure and unpolluted by blood. How. <lb/>
            ever, before the foundation of the city, they used to keep <lb/>
            a pastoral feast called Palilia. The Roman months at the <lb/>
            present day do not in any way correspond to those of <lb/>
            Greece ; yet they (the Greeks) distinctly affirm that the <lb/>
            day upon which Romulus founded the city was the 30th <lb/>
            of the month. The Greeks likewise tell us that on that <lb/>
            day an eclipse of the sun took place, which they think was <lb/>
            that observed by Antimachus of Teos, the epic poet, which <lb/>
            occurred in the third year of the sixth Olympiad. In the <lb/>
            time of Varro the philosopher, who of all the Romans was. <lb/>
            most deeply versed in Roman history, there was one <lb/>
            Taroutius, a companion of his, a philosopher and mathe­ <lb/>
            matician, who had especially devoted himself to the art of <lb/>
            casting nativities, and was thought to have attained great <lb/>
            skill therein. To this man Varro proposed the task of <lb/>
            finding the day and hour of Romulus's birth, basing his <lb/>
            calculations on the influence which the stars were said to <lb/>
            have had upon his life, just as geometricians solve their <lb/>
            problems by the analytic method ; for it belongs, he argued, <lb/>
            to the same science to predict the life of a man from the <lb/>
            time of his birth, and to find the date of a man's birth if <lb/>
            the incidents of his life are given. Taroutius performed <lb/>
            his task, and after considering the things done and suffered <lb/>
            by Romulus, the length of his life, the manner of his death, <lb/>
            and all such like matters, he confidently and boldly asserted <lb/>
            that Romulus was conceived by his mother in the first <lb/>
            year of the second Olympiad, at the third hour of the <lb/>
            twenty-third day of the month which is called in the <lb/>
            Egyptian calendar Choiac, at which time there was a total <lb/>
            eclipse of the sun. He stated that he was born on the <lb/>
            twenty-first day of the month Thouth, about sunrise. Rome <lb/>
            was founded by him on the ninth day of the muuth <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            Pharmouthi, between the second and third hour; for it is <lb/>
            supposed that the fortunes of cities, as well as those of <lb/>
            men, have their certain periods which can be discovered <lb/>
            by the position of the stars at their nativities. The quaint <lb/>
            subtlety of these speculations may perhaps amuse the <lb/>
            reader more than their legendary character will weary <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>XIII. When the city was founded, Romulus first divided <lb/>
            all the able-bodied males into regiments, each consisting <lb/>
            of three thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry. <lb/>
            These were named legions, because they consisted of men <lb/>
            of military age selected from the population. The rest <lb/>
            of the people were now organised. They were called <lb/>
            Populus, and a hundred of the noblest were chosen from <lb/>
            among them and formed into a council. These he called <lb/>
            Patricians, and their assembly the Senate. This word <lb/>
            Senate clearly means assembly of old men; and the <lb/>
            members of it were named Patricians, according to some, <lb/>
            because they were the fathers of legitimate offspring; <lb/>
            according to others, because they were able to give an <lb/>
            account of who their own fathers were, which few of the <lb/>
            first colonists were able to do. Others say that it was <lb/>
            from their Patrocinium, as they then called, and do at the <lb/>
            present day call, their patronage of their clients. There <lb/>
            is a legend that this word arose from one Patron, a com­ <lb/>
            panion of Evander, who was kind and helpful to his <lb/>
            inferiors. But it is most reasonable to suppose that <lb/>
            Romulus called them by this name because he intended <lb/>
            the most powerful men to show kindness to their inferiors, <lb/>
            and to show the poorer classes that they ought not to fear <lb/>
            the great nor grudge them their honours, but be on friendly <lb/>
            terms with them, thinking of them and addressing them <lb/>
            as fathers (Patres). For, up to the present day, foreigners <lb/>
            address the senators as Lords, but the Romans call them <lb/>
            Conscript Fathers, using the most honourable and least <lb/>
            offensive of their titles. Originally they were merely <lb/>
            called the Fathers, but afterwards, as more were enrolled, <lb/>
            they were called Conscript Fathers. By this more <lb/>
            dignified title Romulus distinguished the Senate from the <lb/>
            People ; and he introduced another distinction between <lb/>
            the powerful and the common people by naming the <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            former patrons, which means defenders, and the latter <lb/>
            clients, which means dependants. By this means he im­ <lb/>
            planted in thorn a mutual good feeling which was the <lb/>
            source of great benefits, for the patrons acted as advocates <lb/>
            for their clients in law suits, and in all cases became their <lb/>
            advisers and friends, while the clients not only respected <lb/>
            their patrons but even assisted them, when they were <lb/>
            poor, to portion their daughters or pay their creditors. No <lb/>
            law or magistrate could compel a patron to bear witness <lb/>
            against his client, nor a client against his patron. More­ <lb/>
            over, in later times, although all their other rights remained <lb/>
            unimpaired, it was thought disgraceful for a patron to <lb/>
            receive money from a client. So much for these matters.</p>
          <p>XIV. In the fourth month after the city was founded, <lb/>
            we are told by Fabius, the reckless deed of carrying off <lb/>
            the women took place. Some say that Romulus himself <lb/>
            naturally loved war, and, being persuaded by some pro­ <lb/>
            phecies that Rome was fated to grow by wars and so <lb/>
            reach the greatest prosperity, attacked the Sabines with­ <lb/>
            out provocation ; for he did not carry off many maidens, <lb/>
            but only thirty, as though it was war that he desired more <lb/>
            than wives for his followers. This is not probable: <lb/>
            Romulus saw that his city was newly-filled with colonists, <lb/>
            few of whom had wives, while most of them were a mixed <lb/>
            multitude of poor or unknown origin, who were despised <lb/>
            by the neighouring states, and expected by them shortly <lb/>
            to fall to pieces. He intended his violence to lead to an <lb/>
            alliance with the Sabines, as soon as the damsels became <lb/>
            reconciled to their lot, and set about it as follows : First <lb/>
            he circulated a rumour that the altar of some god had been <lb/>
            discovered, hidden in the earth. This god was called. <lb/>
            Census, either because he was the god of counsel (for the <lb/>
            Romans to this day call their assembly Concilium, and their <lb/>
            chief magistrates consuls, as it were those who take counsel <lb/>
            on behalf of the people), or else it was the equestrian <lb/>
            Neptune. The altar stands in the greater hippodrome, <lb/>
            apd is kept concealed except during the horse-races, when <lb/>
            it is uncovered. Some say that, as the whole plot was <lb/>
            dark and mysterious, it was natural that the god's altar <lb/>
            should be underground. When it was brought out, he <lb/>
            proclaimed a splendid sacrifice in its honour, and games <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            and shows open to all men. Many people assembled to <lb/>
            see them, and Romulus sat among his nobles, dressed in a <lb/>
            purple robe. The signal for the assault was that he should <lb/>
            rise, unfold his cloak, and then again wrap it around him. <lb/>
            Many men armed with swords stood round him, and at the <lb/>
            signal they drew their swords, rushed forward with a <lb/>
            shout, and snatched up the daughters of the Sabines, but <lb/>
            allowed the others to escape unharmed. Some say that <lb/>
            only thirty were carried off, from whom the thirty tribes <lb/>
            were named, but Valerius of Antium says five hundred and <lb/>
            twenty-seven, and Juba six hundred and eighty-three, all <lb/>
            maidens. This is the best apology for Romulus ; for they <lb/>
            only carried off one married woman, Hersilia, which proved <lb/>
            that it was not through insolence or wickedness that they <lb/>
            carried them off, but with the intention of forcibly effect­ <lb/>
            ing a union between the two races. Some say that <lb/>
            Hersilia married Hostilius, one of the noblest Romans, <lb/>
            others that she married Romulus himself, and that he had <lb/>
            children by her; one daughter, called Prima from her being <lb/>
            the first-born, and one son, whom his father originally <lb/>
            named Aollius, because of the assembling of the citizens, <lb/>
            but whom they afterwards named Avillius. This is the <lb/>
            story as told by Zenodotus of Trœzen, but many contra­ <lb/>
            dict it.</p>
          <p>XV. Among the ravishers they say there were some <lb/>
            men of low condition who had seized a remarkably tall <lb/>
            and beautiful maiden. When any of the nobles met them <lb/>
            and endeavoured to take her away from them, they cried <lb/>
            out that they were taking her to Talasius, a young man <lb/>
            of good family and reputation. Hearing this, all agreed <lb/>
            and applauded, and some even turned and accompanied <lb/>
            them, crying out the name of Talasius through their <lb/>
            friendship for him. From this circumstance the Romans <lb/>
            up to the present day call upon Talasius in their marriage- <lb/>
            songs, as the Greeks do upon Hymen; for Talasius is <lb/>
            said to have been fortunate in his wife. Sextius Sulla of <lb/>
            Carthage, a man neither deficient in learning or taste, told <lb/>
            me that this word was given by Romulus as the signal for <lb/>
            the rape, and so that all those who carried off maidens <lb/>
            cried " Talasio." But most authors, among whom is <lb/>
            Juba, think that it is used to encourage brides to industry <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            and spinning wool (talasia), as at that time Greek words <lb/>
            had not been overpowered by Latin ones. But if this be <lb/>
            true, and the Romans at that time really used this word <lb/>
            “ talasia" for wool-spinning, as we do, we might make <lb/>
            another more plausible conjecture about it. When the <lb/>
            treaty of peace was arranged between the Romans and <lb/>
            the Sabines, a special provision was made about the <lb/>
            women, that they were to do no work for the men except <lb/>
            wool-spinning. And thus the custom remained for the <lb/>
            friends of those who were married afterwards to call upon <lb/>
            Talasius in jest, meaning to testify that the bride was to <lb/>
            do no other work than spinning. To the present day the <lb/>
            custom remains in force that the bride must not step over <lb/>
            the threshold into her house, but be lifted over it and <lb/>
            carried in, because the Sabine maidens were carried in <lb/>
            forcibly, and did not walk in.</p>
          <p>Some add that the parting of the bride's hair with the <lb/>
            point of a spear is done in memory of the first Roman <lb/>
            marriage having been effected by war and battle; on <lb/>
            which subject we have enlarged further in our treatise on <lb/>
            Causes.</p>
          <p>The rape of the Sabines took place upon the eighteenth <lb/>
            day of the month Sextilis, which is now called August, <lb/>
            on which day the feast of the Consualia is kept.</p>
          <p>XVI. The Sabines were a numerous and warlike tribe, <lb/>
            dwelling in unwalled villages, as though it was their <lb/>
            birthright as a Lacedaemonian colony to be brave and <lb/>
            fearless. Yet when they found themselves bound by such <lb/>
            hostages to keep the peace, and in fear for their daughters, <lb/>
            they sent an embassy to propose equitable and moderate <lb/>
            terms, that Romulus should give back their daughters to <lb/>
            them, and disavow the violence which had been used, and <lb/>
            that afterwards the two nations should live together in <lb/>
            amity and concord. But when Romulus refused to <lb/>
            deliver up the maidens, but invited the Sabines to accept <lb/>
            his alliance, while the other tribes were hesitating and <lb/>
            considering what was to be done, Acron, the king of the <lb/>
            Ceninetes, a man of spirit and renown in the wars, who <lb/>
            had viewed Romulus first proceeding in founding a city <lb/>
            with suspicion, now, after what he had done in carrying <lb/>
            oil the women, declared that he was becoming dangerous., <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            and would not be endurable unless he were chastised. <lb/>
            He at once began the war, and marched with a great <lb/>
            force; and Romulus marched to meet him. When they <lb/>
            came in sight of each other they each challenged the <lb/>
            other to fight, the soldiers on both sides looking on. <lb/>
            Romulus made a vow that if he should overcome and kill <lb/>
            his enemy he would himself carry his spoils to the temple <lb/>
            of Jupiter and offer them to him. He overcame his <lb/>
            adversary, and slew him, routed his army and captured <lb/>
            his city. He did not harm the inhabitants, except that <lb/>
            he ordered them to demolish their houses and follow him <lb/>
            to Rome, to become citizens on equal terms with the rest. <lb/>
            This is the policy by which Rome grew so great, namely <lb/>
            that of absorbing conquered nations into herself on terms <lb/>
            of equality.</p>
          <p>Romulus, in order to make the fulfilment of his vow as <lb/>
            pleasing to Jupiter, and as fine a spectacle for the citizens <lb/>
            as he could, cut down a tall oak-tree at his camp, and <lb/>
            fashioned it into a trophy,. upon which he hung or fastened <lb/>
            all the arms of Acron, each in its proper place. Then he <lb/>
            girded on his own clothes, placed a crown of laurel upon <lb/>
            his long hair, and, placing the trophy upright on his right <lb/>
            shoulder, marched along in his armour, singing a paean of <lb/>
            victory, with all the army following him. At Rome the <lb/>
            citizens received him with admiration and delight; and <lb/>
            this procession was the origin of all the subsequent <lb/>
            triumphs and the model which they imitated. The <lb/>
            trophy itself was called an offering to Jupiter Feretrius ; <lb/>
            for the Romans call to strike, ferire, and Romulus prayed <lb/>
            that he might strike down his enemy. The spoils were <lb/>
            called spolia opima, according to Varro, because opim <note type="footnote"> * The habit of erecting trophies on a field of battle in token of <lb/>
            victory appears to have been originally confined to the Greeks, who <lb/>
            usually, as in the text, lopped the branches off a tree, placed it in the <lb/>
            ground in some conspicuous place, and hung upon it the shields and <lb/>
            other spoils taken from the enemy. In later times the Romans <lb/>
            adopted the habit of commemorating a victory by erecting some build­ <lb/>
            in, on the field of battle. Under the emperors, victory was com­ <lb/>
            memorated by a triumphal arch at Rome, many of which now exist. <lb/>
            The Greek trophies were always formed of perishable materials, and <lb/>
            it was contrary to their custom to repair them, that they might not <lb/>
            perpetuate national enmities. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            means excellence. A more plausible interpretation would <lb/>
            be from the deed itself, for work is called in Latin opus. <lb/>
            This dedication of spolia opima is reserved as a privilege <lb/>
            for a general who has slain the opposing general with hit <lb/>
            own hand. It has only been enjoyed by three Roman <lb/>
            generals, first by Romulus, who slew Acron, king of the <lb/>
            Ceninetes, second by Cornelius Cossus, who slew the <lb/>
            Tyrrhenian Tolumnius, and, above all, by Claudius <lb/>
            Marcellus, who killed Britomart, the king of the Gauls. <lb/>
            Now Cossus and Marcellus drove into the city in chariots <lb/>
            and four, carrying the trophies in their own hands; but <lb/>
            Dionysius is in error when he says that Romulus used a <lb/>
            chariot and four, for the historians tell us that Tarquinius, <lb/>
            the son of Demaratus, was the first of the kings who <lb/>
            introduced this pomp into his triumphs. Others say that <lb/>
            Poplicola was the first to triumph in a chariot. However, <lb/>
            the statues of Romulus bearing the trophy, which are to <lb/>
            be seen in Rome, are all on foot.</p>
          <p>XVII. After the capture of the Ceninete tribe, while <lb/>
            the rest of the Sabines were still engaged in preparation <lb/>
            for war, the inhabitants of Fidenee and Crustumerium and <lb/>
            Antemna attacked the Romans. A battle took place in <lb/>
            which they were all alike worsted, after which they <lb/>
            permitted Romulus to take their cities, divide their lands, <lb/>
            and incorporate them as citizens. Romulus divided all the <lb/>
            lands among the citizens, except that which was held by <lb/>
            the fathers of any of the maidens who had been carried off, <lb/>
            which he allowed them to retain.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the Sabines, angry at these successes, <lb/>
            chose Tatius as their general and marched against Rome. <lb/>
            The city was hard to attack, as the Capitol stood as an <lb/>
            advanced fort to defend it. Here was placed a garrison, <lb/>
            and Tarpeius was its commander, not the maiden Tarpeia, <lb/>
            as some write, who make out Romulus a fool; but it was <lb/>
            this Tarpeia, the daughter of the captain of the garrison, <lb/>
            who betrayed the capital to the Sabines, for the sake of <lb/>
            the golden bracelets which she saw them wearing. She <lb/>
            asked as the price of her treachery that they should give <lb/>
            her what they wore on their left arms. After making an <lb/>
            agreement with Tatius, she opened a gate at night and let <lb/>
            in the Sabines. Now it appears that Antigonus was not <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            singular when he said that he loved men when they were <lb/>
            betraying, but hated them after they had betrayed; as <lb/>
            also Cæsar said, in the case of Rhymitalkes the Thracian, <lb/>
            that he loved the treachery but hated the traitor; but this <lb/>
            seems a common reflection about bad men by those who <lb/>
            have need of them, just as we need the poison of certain <lb/>
            venomous beasts; for they appreciate their value while they <lb/>
            are making use of them, and loathe their wickedness when <lb/>
            they have done with them. And that was how Tarpeia <lb/>
            was treated by Tatius. He ordered the Sabines to re­ <lb/>
            member their agreement, and not to grudge her what was <lb/>
            on their left arms. He himself first of all took off his <lb/>
            gold armlet, and with it flung his great oblong shield. <lb/>
            As all the rest did the like, she perished, being pelted with <lb/>
            the gold bracelets and crushed by the number and weight <lb/>
            of the shields. Tarpeius also was convicted of treachery <lb/>
            by Romulus, according to Juba's version of the history of <lb/>
            Sulpicius Galba. The other legends about Tarpeia are <lb/>
            improbable; amongst them that which is told by Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus, that she was the daughter of Tatius the Sabine <lb/>
            leader, abducted by Romulus, and treated by her father <lb/>
            as is related above. Simylus the poet talks utter nonsense <lb/>
            when he says that it was not the Sabines but the Gauls to <lb/>
            whom Tarpeia betrayed the Capitol, because she was in <lb/>
            love with their king. His verses run as follows : <lb/>
            “ And near Tarpeia, by the Capitol <lb/>
            That dwelt, betrayer of the walls of Rome. <lb/>
            She loved the chieftain of the Gauls too well, <lb/>
            To guard from treachery her father's home."</p>
          <p>And a little afterwards he speaks of her death. <lb/>
            “ Her did the Boians and the Celtic tribes <lb/>
            Bury, but not beside the stream of Po; <lb/>
            From off their warlike arms their shields they flung, <lb/>
            And what the damsel longed for laid her low."</p>
          <p>XVIII. However, as Tarpeia was buried there, the hill <lb/>
            was called the Tarpeian hill until King Tarquinius, when <lb/>
            he dedicated the place to Jupiter, removed her remains and <lb/>
            abolished the name of Tarpeia. But even to this day they <lb/>
            call the rock in the Capitol the Tarpeian Rock, down <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            which malefactors used to be flung. When the Sabines <lb/>
            held the citadel, Romulus in fury challenged them to <lb/>
            come down and fight. Tatius accepted his challenge with <lb/>
            confidence, as he saw that if overpowered his men would <lb/>
            have a strong place of refuge to retreat to. All the inter­ <lb/>
            mediate space, in which they were about to engage, was <lb/>
            surrounded by hills, and so seemed to make a desperate <lb/>
            battle necessary, as there were but narrow outlets for <lb/>
            flight or pursuit. It chanced, also, that the river had <lb/>
            been in flood a few days before, and had left a deep muddy <lb/>
            pool of water upon the level ground where the Forum now <lb/>
            stands; so that men's footing was not certain, but difficult <lb/>
            and treacherous. Here a piece of good fortune betel the <lb/>
            Sabines as they heedlessly pressed forward. Curtius, one <lb/>
            of their chiefs, a man with a reputation for dashing <lb/>
            courage, rode on horseback far before the rest. His horse <lb/>
            plunged into this morass, and he, after trying to extricate <lb/>
            him, at last finding it impossible, left him there and <lb/>
            saved himself. This place, in memory of him, is still <lb/>
            called the Gulf of Curtius. Warned of their danger, the <lb/>
            Sabines fought a stout and indecisive battle, in which <lb/>
            many fell, amongst them Hostilius. He is said to have <lb/>
            been the husband of Hersilia and the grandfather of <lb/>
            Hostilius, who became king after the reign of Numa. <lb/>
            Many combats took place in that narrow space, as we may <lb/>
            suppose; and especial mention is made of one, which <lb/>
            proved the last, in which Romulus was struck on the head <lb/>
            by a stone and like to fall, and unable to fight longer. <lb/>
            The Romans now gave way to the Sabines, and fled to the <lb/>
            Palatine hill, abandoning the level ground. Romulus, <lb/>
            now recovered from the blow, endeavoured to stay the <lb/>
            fugitives, and with loud shouts called upon them to stand <lb/>
            firm and fight. But as the stream of fugitives poured on, <lb/>
            and no one had the courage to face round, he lifted his <lb/>
            hands to heaven and prayed to Jupiter to stay the army <lb/>
            and not to allow the tottering state of Rome to fall, but to <lb/>
            help it. After his prayer many were held back from flight <lb/>
            by reverence for the king, and the fugitives suddenly <lb/>
            resumed their confidence. They made their first stand <lb/>
            where now is the temple of Jupiter Stator, which one may <lb/>
            translate “ He who makes to stand firm and then forming <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            their ranks once more they drove back the Sabines a8 far as <lb/>
            what is now called the Palace, and the Temple of Vesta.</p>
          <p>XIX. While they were preparing to fight as though the <lb/>
            battle was only now just begun, they were restrained by a <lb/>
            strange spectacle, beyond the power of words to express. <lb/>
            The daughters of the Sabines who had been carried off <lb/>
            were seen rushing from all quarters, with loud shrieks and <lb/>
            wailings, through the ranks and among the dead bodies, as <lb/>
            though possessed by some god. Some of them carried <lb/>
            infant children in their arms, and others wore their hair <lb/>
            loose and dishevelled. All of them kept addressing the <lb/>
            Romans and the Sabines alternately by the most endearing <lb/>
            names. The hearts of both armies were melted, and they <lb/>
            fell back so as to leave a space for the women between <lb/>
            them. A murmur of sorrow ran through all the ranks, <lb/>
            and a strong feeling of pity was excited by the sight of <lb/>
            the women, and by their words, which began with <lb/>
            arguments and upbraidings, but ended in entreaties and <lb/>
            tears. “ What wrong have we done to you," said they, <lb/>
            “ that we should have suffered and should even now <lb/>
            suffer such cruel treatment at your hands? We were <lb/>
            violently and wrongfully torn away from our friends, <lb/>
            and after we had been carried off we were neglected by <lb/>
            our brothers, fathers, and relatives for so long a time, <lb/>
            that now, bound by the closest of ties to our enemies, we <lb/>
            tremble for our ravishers and wrongers when they fight, <lb/>
            and weep when they fall. Ye would not come and tear <lb/>
            us from our ravishers while we were yet maidens, but <lb/>
            now ye would separate wives from their husbands, and <lb/>
            mothers from their children, a worse piece of service to <lb/>
            us than your former neglect. Even if it was not about <lb/>
            us that you began to fight, you ought to cease now that <lb/>
            you have become fathers-in-law, and grandfathers, and <lb/>
            relatives one of another. But if the war is about us, then <lb/>
            carry us off with your sons-in-law and our children, and give <lb/>
            us our fathers and relatives, but do not take our husbands <lb/>
            and children from us. We beseech you not to allow us to <lb/>
            be carried off captive a second time." Hersilia spoke aI <lb/>
            length in this fashion, and as the other women added their <lb/>
            entreaties to hers, a truce was agreed upon, and the chiefs <lb/>
            met in conference. Hereupon the women made their <note type="footnote"> A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            husbands and children known to their fathers and brothers, <lb/>
            fetched food and drink for such as needed it, and took the <lb/>
            wounded into their own houses to be attended to there. <lb/>
            Thus they let their friends see that they were mistresses <lb/>
            of their own houses, and that their husbands attended to <lb/>
            their wishes and treated them with every respect.</p>
          <p>In the conference it was accordingly determined that <lb/>
            such women as chose to do so should continue to live with <lb/>
            their husbands, free, as we have already related, from all <lb/>
            work and duties except that of spinning wool (talasia); <lb/>
            that the Romans and the Sabines should dwell together <lb/>
            in the city, and that the city should be called Rome, after <lb/>
            Romulus, but the Romans be called Quirites after the <lb/>
            native city of Tatius; and that they should both reign <lb/>
            and command the army together. The place where this <lb/>
            compact was made is even to this day called the Comitium, <lb/>
            for the Romans call meeting coire.</p>
          <p>XX. Now that the city was doubled in numbers, a <lb/>
            hundred more senators were elected from among the <lb/>
            Sabines, and the legions were composed of six thousand <lb/>
            infantry and six hundred cavalry. They also established <lb/>
            three tribes, of which they named one Rhamnenses, from <lb/>
            Romulus, another Titienses from Tatius, and the third <lb/>
            Lucerenses, after the name of a grove to which many had <lb/>
            fled for refuge, requiring asylum, and had been admitted <lb/>
            as citizens. They call a grove lucus. The very name of <lb/>
            tribe and tribune show that there were three tribes. Each <lb/>
            tribe was divided into ten centuries, which some say were <lb/>
            named after the women who were carried off; but this <lb/>
            seems to be untrue, as many of them are named after <lb/>
            places. However, many privileges were conferred upon <lb/>
            the women, amongst which were that men should make <lb/>
            way for them when they walked out, to say nothing <lb/>
            disgraceful in their presence, or appear naked before them, <lb/>
            on pain of being tried before the criminal court; and also <lb/>
            that their children should wear the bulla, which is so <lb/>
            called from its shape, which is like a bubble, and was <lb/>
            worn round the neck, and also the broad purple border of <lb/>
            their robe (prcetexta).</p>
          <p>The kings did not conduct their deliberations together, <lb/>
            but each first took counsel with his own hundred senators, <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            and then they all met together. Tatius dwelt where now <lb/>
            is the temple of Juno Moneta, and Romulus by the steps <lb/>
            of the Fair Shore, as it is called, which are at the descent <lb/>
            from the Palatine hill into the great Circus. Here they <lb/>
            say the sacred cornel-tree grew, the legend being that <lb/>
            Romulus, to try his strength, threw a spear, with cornel­ <lb/>
            wood shaft, from Mount Aventine, and when the spear-head <lb/>
            sunk into the ground, though many tried, no one was <lb/>
            able to pull it out. The soil, which was fertile, suited <lb/>
            the wood, and it budded, and became the stem of a good­ <lb/>
            sized cornel-tree. After the death of Romulus this was <lb/>
            preserved and reverenced as one of the holiest objects in <lb/>
            the city. A wall was built round it, and whenever any <lb/>
            one thought that it looked inclined to droop and wither <lb/>
            he at once raised a shout to tell the bystanders, and they, <lb/>
            just as if they were assisting to put out a fire, called for <lb/>
            water, and came from all quarters carrying pots of water <lb/>
            to the place. It is said that when Caius Cæsar repaired <lb/>
            the steps, and the workmen were digging near it, they <lb/>
            unintentionally damaged the roots, and the tree died.</p>
          <p>XXI. The Sabines adopted the Roman system of months, <lb/>
            and all that is remarkable about them will be found in <lb/>
            the 4 Life of Numa.' But Romulus adopted the largo <lb/>
            oblong Sabine shield, and gave up the round Argolic <lb/>
            shields which he and the Romans had formerly carried. <lb/>
            The two nations shared each other's festivals, not abolish­ <lb/>
            ing any which either had been wont to celebrate, but <lb/>
            introducing several new ones, among which are the <lb/>
            Matronalia, instituted in honour of the women at the <lb/>
            end of the war, and that of the Carmentalia. It is <lb/>
            thought by some that Carmenta is the ruling destiny <lb/>
            which presides over a man's birth, wherefore she is <lb/>
            worshipped by mothers. Others say that she was the <lb/>
            wife of Evander the Arcadian, a prophetess who used to <lb/>
            chant oracles in verse, and hence surnamed Carmenta (for <lb/>
            the Romans call verses carmina); whereas it is generally <lb/>
            admitted that her right name was Nicostrate. Some <lb/>
            explain the name of Carmenta more plausibly as meaning <lb/>
            that during her prophetic frenzy she was bereft of intellect; <lb/>
            for the Romans call to lack, carere; and mind, mentem.</p>
          <p>We have spoken before of the feast of the Palilia. That <note type="footnote"> s 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            of the Lupercalia would seem, from the time of its cele­ <lb/>
            bration, to be a ceremony of purification; for it is held <lb/>
            during the ominous days of February, a month whose name <lb/>
            one might translate by Purification; and that particular <lb/>
            day was originally called Febrate. The name of this feast <lb/>
            in Greek signifies that of wolves, and it is thought, on this <lb/>
            account, to be very ancient, and derived from the Arcadians <lb/>
            who came to Italy with Evander. Still this is an open <lb/>
            question, for the name may have arisen from the she-wolf, <lb/>
            as we see that the Luperci start to run their course from <lb/>
            the place where Romulus is said to have been exposed. <lb/>
            The circumstances of the ritual are such as to make it <lb/>
            hard to conjecture their meaning. They slaughter goats, <lb/>
            and then two youths of good family are brought to them. <lb/>
            Then some with a bloody knife mark the foreheads of the <lb/>
            youths, and others at once wipe the blood away with wool <lb/>
            dipped in milk. The youths are expected to laugh when <lb/>
            it is wiped away. After this they cut the skins of the <lb/>
            goats into strips and run about naked, except a girdle <lb/>
            round the middle, striking with the thongs all whom they <lb/>
            meet. Women in the prime of life do not avoid being <lb/>
            struck, as they believe that it assists them in childbirth <lb/>
            and promotes fertility. It is also a peculiarity of this <lb/>
            festival that the Luperci sacrifice a dog. One Bontes, <lb/>
            who wrote an elegiac poem on the origin of the Roman <lb/>
            myths, says that when Romulus and his party had killed <lb/>
            Amulius, they ran back in their joy to the place where <lb/>
            the she-wolf suckled them when little, and that the feast <lb/>
            is typical of this, and that the young nobles run, <lb/>
            “ As, smiting all they met, that day <lb/>
            From Alba Romulus and Remus ran." <lb/>
            The bloody sword is placed upon their foreheads in token <lb/>
            of the danger and slaughter of that day, and the wiping <lb/>
            with the milk is in remembrance of their nurse. Caius <lb/>
            Acilius tells us that, before the foundation of Rome, the <lb/>
            cattle of Romulus and Remus were missing, and they, after <lb/>
            invoking Faunus, ran out to search for them, naked, that <lb/>
            they might not be inconvenienced by sweat; and that this <lb/>
            is the reason that the Luperci ran about naked. As for the <lb/>
            dog, one would say that if the sacrifice is purificatory, it is <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            sacrificed on behalf of those who use it. The Greeks, in <lb/>
            their purificatory rites, sacrifice dogs, and often make use <lb/>
            of what is called Periskylakismos. But if this feast be in <lb/>
            honour of the she-wolf, in gratitude for her suckling and <lb/>
            preserving of Romulus, then it is very natural to sacrifice <lb/>
            a clog, for it is an enemy of wolves; unless, indeed, the <lb/>
            beast is put to death to punish it for hindering the Luperci <lb/>
            when they ran their course.</p>
          <p>XXII. It is said also that Romulus instituted the service <lb/>
            of the sacred fire of Vestæ, and the holy virgins who keep <lb/>
            it up, called Vestals. Others attribute this to Numa, <lb/>
            though they say that Romulus was a very religious prince, <lb/>
            and learned in divination, for which purpose he used to <lb/>
            carry the crooked staff called lituus, with which to divide <lb/>
            the heavens into spaces for the observation of the flight of <lb/>
            birds. This, which is preserved in the Palatium, was lost <lb/>
            when the city was taken by the Gauls; but afterwards, <lb/>
            when the barbarians had been repulsed, it was found un­ <lb/>
            harmed in a deep bed of ashes, where everything else had <lb/>
            been burned or spoiled. He also enacted some laws, the <lb/>
            most arbitrary of which is that a wife cannot obtain a <lb/>
            divorce from her husband, but that a husband may put <lb/>
            away his wife for poisoning her children, conterfeiting <lb/>
            keys, or adultery. If any one put away his wife on other <lb/>
            grounds than these, he enacted that half his property <lb/>
            should go to his wife, and half to the temple of Ceres. A <lb/>
            man who divorced his wife was to make an offering to the <lb/>
            Chthonian gods.- A peculiarity of his legislation is that, <lb/>
            while he laid down no course of procedure in case of <lb/>
            parricide, he speaks of all murder by the name of parricide, <lb/>
            as though the one were an abominable, but the other an <lb/>
            impossible crime. And for many years it appeared that <lb/>
            he had rightly judged, for no one attempted anything of <lb/>
            the kind at Rome for nearly six hundred years ; but it is <lb/>
            said that the first parricide was that of Lucius Hostilius, <lb/>
            which he committed after the war with Hannibal. Enough <lb/>
            has now been said upon these subjects.</p>
          <p>XXIII. In the fifth year of the reign of Tatius, some of <lb/>
            his relatives fell in with ambassadors from Laurentum, on <note type="footnote"> * Chthonian gods are the goda of the world below. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            their way to Rome, and endeavoured to rob them. As the <lb/>
            ambassadors would not submit to this, but defended them­ <lb/>
            selves, they slew them. Romulus at once gave it as his <lb/>
            opinion that the authors of this great and audacious crime <lb/>
            ought to be punished, but Tatius hushed the matter up, <lb/>
            and enabled them to escape. This is said to have been <lb/>
            the only occasion upon which they were openly at variance, <lb/>
            for in all other matters they acted with the greatest <lb/>
            possible unanimity. The relatives, however, of the mur­ <lb/>
            dered men, as they were hindered by Tatius from receiving <lb/>
            any satisfaction, fell upon him when he and Romulus were <lb/>
            offering sacrifice at Lavinium, and slew him, but respected <lb/>
            Romulus, and praised him as a just man. He brought home <lb/>
            the body of Tatius, and buried it honourably. It lies near <lb/>
            what is called the Armilustrium, on Mount Aventine.</p>
          <p>But Romulus neglected altogether to exact any satis­ <lb/>
            faction for the murder. Some writers say that the city of <lb/>
            Lavinium, in its terror, delivered up the murderers of <lb/>
            Tatius, but that Romulus allowed them to depart, saying <lb/>
            that blood had been atoned for by blood. This speech of <lb/>
            his gave rise to some suspicion that he was not displeased <lb/>
            at being rid of his colleague. However, it caused no dis­ <lb/>
            turbance in the state, and did not move the Sabines to <lb/>
            revolt, but partly out of regard for Homulus, and fear of <lb/>
            his power, and belief in his divine mission, they continued <lb/>
            to live under his rule with cheerfulness and respect. Many <lb/>
            foreign tribes also respected Romulus, and the more ancient <lb/>
            Latin races sent him ambassadors, and made treaties of <lb/>
            friendship and alliance.</p>
          <p>fTe took Fidenæ, a city close to Rome, according to some <lb/>
            authorities, by sending his cavalry thither on a sudden, <lb/>
            and ordering them to cut the pivots of the city gates, and <lb/>
            then unexpectedly appearing in person. Others say that <lb/>
            the people of Fidenæ first invaded the Roman territory, <lb/>
            drove off plunder from it, and insulted the neighbourhood <lb/>
            of the city itself, and that Homulus laid an ambush for <lb/>
            them. slew many, and took their city. He did not destroy it, <lb/>
            but made it a Roman colony, and sent two thousand five <lb/>
            hundred Romans thither as colonists on the Ides of April.</p>
          <p>XXIV. After this a pestilence fell upon Rome, which <lb/>
            slew men suddenly without previous sickness, and afflicted <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            the crops and cattle with barrenness. A shower of blood <lb/>
            also fell in the city, so that religious terror was added to <lb/>
            the peopled sufferings. As a similar visitation befell the <lb/>
            citizens of Laurentum, it became evident that the wrath <lb/>
            of the gods was visiting these cities because of the un­ <lb/>
            avenged murders of Tatius and of the ambassadors. The <lb/>
            guilty parties were delivered up on both sides, and duly <lb/>
            punished, after which the plague was sensibly mitigated. <lb/>
            Romulus also purified the city with lustrations, which, <lb/>
            they say, are even now practised at the Ferentine gate. <lb/>
            But before the plague ceased, the people of Camerium <lb/>
            attacked the Romans, supposing that they would be unable <lb/>
            to defend themselves on account of their misfortune, and <lb/>
            overran their country. Nevertheless, Romulus instantly <lb/>
            marched against them, slew six hundred of them in battle, <lb/>
            and took their city. Half the survivors he transplanted to <lb/>
            Rome, and settled twice as many Romans as the remainder <lb/>
            at Camerium, on the Kalends of Sextilis. So many citizens <lb/>
            had he to spare after he had only inhabited Rome for about <lb/>
            sixteen years. Among the other spoils, he carried off a <lb/>
            brazen four-horse chariot from Camerium; this he dedi­ <lb/>
            cated in the temple of Vulcan, having placed in it a figure <lb/>
            of himself being crowned by Victory.</p>
          <p>XXV. As the city was now so flourishing, the weaker <lb/>
            of the neighbouring states made submission, and were glad <lb/>
            to receive assurance that they would be unharmed; but <lb/>
            the more powerful, fearing and envying Romulus, con­ <lb/>
            sidered that they ought not to remain quiet, but ought to <lb/>
            check the growth of Rome. First the Etruscans of Veil, a <lb/>
            people possessed of wide lands and a large city, began the <lb/>
            war by demanding the surrender to them of Fidenæ, which <lb/>
            they claimed as belonging to them. This demand was not <lb/>
            only unjust, but absurd, seeing that they had not assisted <lb/>
            the people of Fidenæ when they were fighting and in <lb/>
            danger, but permitted them to be destroyed, and then de­ <lb/>
            manded their houses and lands, when they were in the <lb/>
            possession of others. Receiving a haughty answer from <lb/>
            Romulus, they divided themselves into two bodies, with <lb/>
            one of which they attacked Fidenæ, and with the other <lb/>
            went to meet Romulus. At Fidenæ they conquered the <lb/>
            Romans, and slew two thousand; but they were defeated <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            by Romulus, with a loss of eight thousand men. A second <lb/>
            battle now took place at Fidenæ, in which all agree that <lb/>
            Romulus took the most important part, showing the <lb/>
            greatest skill and courage, and a strength and swiftness <lb/>
            more than mortal. But some accounts are altogether <lb/>
            fabulous, such as that fourteen hundred were slain, more <lb/>
            than half of whom Romulus slew with his own hand. The <lb/>
            Messenians appear to use equally inflated language about <lb/>
            Aristomenes, when they tell us that he thrice offered <lb/>
            sacrifice for having slain a hundred Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            After the victory, Romulus did not pursue the beaten <lb/>
            army, but marched straight to the city of Veil. The <lb/>
            citizens, after so great a disaster, made no resistance, but <lb/>
            at their own request were granted a treaty and alliance <lb/>
            for a hundred years, giving up a large portion of their <lb/>
            territory, called the Septem Pagi, or seven districts, and <lb/>
            their saltworks by the river, and handing over fifty of <lb/>
            their leading men as hostages.</p>
          <p>For his success at Veii, Romulus enjoyed another <lb/>
            triumph, on the Ides of October, when he led in his train <lb/>
            many captives, amongst whom was the Veientine general, <lb/>
            an old man, who was thought to have mismanaged matters <lb/>
            foolishly and like a boy. On this account to this day, <lb/>
            when a sacrifice is made for victory, they lead an old man <lb/>
            through the Forum and up to the Capitol, dressed in a <lb/>
            boy's robe with wide purple border, and with a child's <lb/>
            bulla hung round his neck; and the herald calls out <lb/>
            “ Sardinians for sale." For the Tyrrhenians or Tuscans <lb/>
            are said to be of Sardinian origin, and Veil is a Tyrrhenian <lb/>
            city.</p>
          <p>XXVI. This was Romulus's last war. After it, he, like <lb/>
            nearly all those who have risen to power and fame by a <lb/>
            great and unexpected series of successes, became filled <lb/>
            with self-confidence and arrogance, and, in place of his <lb/>
            former popular manners, assumed the offensive style of a <lb/>
            despot. He wore a purple tunic, and a toga with a purple <lb/>
            border, and did business reclining instead of sitting on a <lb/>
            throne; and was always attended by the band of youths <lb/>
            called Celeres, from their quickness in service. Others <lb/>
            walked before him with staves to kepp off the crowd, and <lb/>
            were girt with thongs, with which to bind any one whom <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            he might order into custody. The Latins used formerly <lb/>
            to call to bind ligare, and now call it alligare ; wherefore <lb/>
            the staff-bearers are called lictors, and their staves are <lb/>
            called bacula,* from the rods which they then carried. It <lb/>
            is probable that these officers now called lictors by the <lb/>
            insertion of the c, were originally called litors, that is. in <lb/>
            Greek, leitourgoi (public officials). For to this day the <lb/>
            Greeks call a town-hall leitus, and the people laos.</p>
          <p>XXVII. When Romulus' grandfather Numitor died in <lb/>
            Alba, although he was evidently his heir, yet through a <lb/>
            desire for popularity he left his claim unsettled, and <lb/>
            contented himself with appointing a chief magistrate for <lb/>
            the people of Alba every year; thus teaching the Roman <lb/>
            nobles to desire a freer constitution, which should not be <lb/>
            so much encroached upon by the king. For at Rome now <lb/>
            even the so-called Fathers took no part in public affairs, <lb/>
            but had merely their name and dignity, and were called <lb/>
            into the Senate House more for form's sake than to express <lb/>
            their opinions. When there, they listened in silence to <lb/>
            Romulus's orders, and the only advantage which they <lb/>
            possessed over the commons was that they knew the king's <lb/>
            mind sooner than they. Worst of all was, that he of his <lb/>
            own authority divided the land which was obtained in <lb/>
            war amongst the soldiers, and restored the hostages to <lb/>
            the Veientines, against the will of the Senate and without <lb/>
            consulting it, by which he seemed purposely to insult it. <lb/>
            On this account the Senate was suspected, when shortly <lb/>
            after this he miraculously disappeared. His disappearance <lb/>
            took place on the Nones of the month now called July, <lb/>
            but then Quintilis, leaving nothing certain or agreed on <lb/>
            about his end except the date. Even now things happen <lb/>
            in the same fashion as then ; and we need not wonder at <lb/>
            the uncertainty about the death of Romulus, when that of <lb/>
            Scipio Africanus, in his own house after supper, proved <lb/>
            so inexplicable, some saying that it arose from an evil <lb/>
            habit of body, some that he had poisoned himself, some <lb/>
            that his enemies had suffocated him during the night. <lb/>
            And yet the corpse of Scipio lay openly exposed for all <note type="footnote"> * The Romans termed these bundles of rods fasces. The derivation <lb/>
            of lictor from the Greek ahows the utter ignorance of etymology <lb/>
            prevailing among the ancients. </note> <lb/>

            to see, and gave all who saw it some ground for their <lb/>
            conjectures; whereas Romulus suddenly disappeared, and <lb/>
            no morsel of his body or shred of his garments were ever <lb/>
            seen again. Some supposed that the Senators fell upon <lb/>
            him in the Temple of Vulcan, and, after killing, him cut <lb/>
            his body in pieces and each of them carried off one in the <lb/>
            folds of his robe. Others think that his disappearance <lb/>
            took place neither in the Temple of Vulcan, nor yet in <lb/>
            the presence of the Senators alone, but say that Romulus <lb/>
            was holding an assembly without the city, near a place <lb/>
            called the Goat's Marsh, when suddenly strange and <lb/>
            wonderful things took place in the heavens, and marvel­ <lb/>
            lous changes; for the sun's light was extinguished, and <lb/>
            night fell, not calm and quiet, but with terrible thunder­ <lb/>
            ings, gusts of wind, and driving spray from all quarters. <lb/>
            Hereupon the people took to flight in confusion, but the <lb/>
            nobles collected together by themselves. When the storm <lb/>
            was over, and the light returned, the people returned to <lb/>
            the place again, and searched in vain for Romulus, but <lb/>
            were told by the nobles not to trouble themselves to look <lb/>
            for him, but to pray to Romulus and reverence him, for <lb/>
            he had been caught up into heaven, and now would be a <lb/>
            propitious god for them instead of a good king.</p>
          <p>The people believed this story, and went their way re­ <lb/>
            joicing, and praying to him with good hope; but there <lb/>
            were some who discussed the whole question in a harsh <lb/>
            and unfriendly spirit, and blamed the nobles for encourag­ <lb/>
            ing the people to such acts of folly when they themselves <lb/>
            were the murderers of the king.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Now Julius Proculus, one of the noblest <lb/>
            patricians, and of good reputation, being one of the <lb/>
            original colonists from Alba, and a friend and companion <lb/>
            of Romulus, came into the Forum, and there upon his <lb/>
            oath, and touching the most sacred things, stated before <lb/>
            all men that as he was walking along the road Romulus <lb/>
            appeared, meeting him, more beautiful and taller than he <lb/>
            had ever appeared before, with bright and glittering arms. <lb/>
            Astonished at the vision he had spoken thus : " 0 king, <lb/>
            for what reason or with what object have you left us <lb/>
            exposed to an unjust and hateful suspicion, and left the <lb/>
            whole city desolate and plunged in the deepest grief ? " <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            He answered, “ It pleased the gods, Proculus, that I should <lb/>
            spend thus much time among mankind, and after found­ <lb/>
            ing a city of the greatest power and glory should return <lb/>
            to heaven whence I came. Fare thee well; and tell the <lb/>
            Romans that by courage and self-control they will attain <lb/>
            to the highest pitch of human power. I will ever be for <lb/>
            you the kindly deity Quirinus."</p>
          <p>This tale was believed by the Romans from the manner <lb/>
            of Proculus in relating it and from his oath: indeed a <lb/>
            religious feeling almost amounting to ecstasy seems to <lb/>
            have taken hold of all present; for no one contradicted <lb/>
            him, but all dismissed their suspicions entirely from their <lb/>
            minds and prayed to Quirinus, worshipping him as a god.</p>
          <p>This account resembles the Greek legends of Aristeas of <lb/>
            Proconnesus, and that of Kleomedes of Astypalæa. The <lb/>
            story goes that Aristeas died in a fuller's shop, and that <lb/>
            when his friends came to fetch his body it had disap­ <lb/>
            peared ; then some persons who had just returned from <lb/>
            travel said that they had met Aristeas walking along the <lb/>
            road to Kroton. Kleomedes, we are told, was a man of <lb/>
            unusual size and strength, but stupid and half-crazy, who <lb/>
            did many deeds of violence, and at last in a boy's school <lb/>
            struck and broke in two the column that supported the <lb/>
            roof, and brought it down. As the boys were killed, <lb/>
            Kleomedes, pursued by the people, got into a wooden chest, <lb/>
            and shut down the lid, holding in inside so that many <lb/>
            men together were not able to force it open. They broke <lb/>
            open the chest, and found no man in it, dead or alive. <lb/>
            Astonished at this, they sent an embassy to the oracle at <lb/>
            Delphi, to whom the Pythia answered, <lb/>
            " Last of the heroes is Kleomedes of Astypalæa.” <lb/>
            And it also related that the corpse of Alkmena when it <lb/>
            was being carried out for burial, disappeared, and a stone <lb/>
            was found lying on the bier in its place. And many such <lb/>
            stories are told, in which, contrary to reason, the earthly <lb/>
            parts of our bodies are described as being deified together <lb/>
            with the spiritual parts. It is wicked and base to deny <lb/>
            that virtue is a spiritual quality, but again it is foolish to <lb/>
            mix earthly with heavenly things.</p>
          <p>We must admit, speaking with due caution, that, <lb/>
            as Pindar has it, the bodies of all men follow over­ <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            powering Death, but there remains a living spirit, the <lb/>
            image of eternity, for it alone comes from heaven. <lb/>
            Thence it comes, and thither it returns again, not accom­ <lb/>
            panied by the body, but only when it is most thoroughly <lb/>
            separated and cleansed from it, and become pure and <lb/>
            incorporeal. This is the pure spirit which Herakleitus <lb/>
            calls the best, which darts through the body like lightning <lb/>
            through a cloud, whereas that which is clogged by the <lb/>
            body is like a dull, cloudy exhalation, hard to loose and <lb/>
            free from the bonds of the body. There is no reason, <lb/>
            therefore, for supposing that the bodies of good men rise <lb/>
            up into heaven, which is contrary to nature; but we must <lb/>
            believe that men's virtues and their spirits most certainly, <lb/>
            naturally and rightly proceed from mankind to the heroes, <lb/>
            and from them to the genii, and from thence, if they be <lb/>
            raised above and purified from all mortal and earthly <lb/>
            taint, even as is done in the holy mysteries, then, not by <lb/>
            any empty vote of the senate, but in very truth and <lb/>
            likelihood they are received among the gods, and meet <lb/>
            with the most blessed and glorious end.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Some say that the name Quirinus, which <lb/>
            Romulus received, means Mars; others that it was because <lb/>
            his people were called Quirites. Others, again, say that the <lb/>
            spear-head or spear was called by the ancients Quirts, and <lb/>
            that the statue of Juno leaning on a spear is called Juno <lb/>
            Quirites, and that the dart which is placed in the Regia <lb/>
            is addressed as Mars, and that it is customary to present <lb/>
            with a spear those who have distinguished themselves in <lb/>
            war, and therefore that it was as a warrior, or god of war, <lb/>
            that Romulus was called Quirinus. A temple dedicated <lb/>
            to him is built on the Quirinal Hill which bears his name, <lb/>
            and the day of his translation is called the People's Flight, <lb/>
            and the Nonæ Caprotinæ, because they go out of the city <lb/>
            to the Goat's Marsh on that day to sacrifice, for in Latin a <lb/>
            goat is called Capra. And as they go to the sacrifice they <lb/>
            call out many of the names of the country, as Marcus, <lb/>
            Lucius, Caius, with loud shouts, in imitation of their panic <lb/>
            on that occasion, and their calling to each other in fear <lb/>
            and confusion. But some say that this is not an imitation <lb/>
            of terror, but of eagerness, and that this is the reason of it : <lb/>
            after the Gauls had captured Rome and been driven out <lb/>
            by Camillus, and the city through weakness did not easily <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            recover itself, an army of Latins, under one Livius <lb/>
            Postumius, marched upon it. He halted his army not far <lb/>
            from Rome, and sent a herald to say that the Latins were <lb/>
            willing to renew their old domestic ties, which had fallen <lb/>
            into disuse, and to unite the races by new intermarriage. <lb/>
            If, therefore, the Romans would send out to them all their <lb/>
            maidens and unmarried women, they would live with them <lb/>
            on terms of peace and friendship, as the Romans had long <lb/>
            before done with the Sabines. The Romans, when they <lb/>
            heard this, were afraid of going to war, yet thought that <lb/>
            the surrender of their women was no better than captivity. <lb/>
            While they were in perplexity, a female slave named <lb/>
            Philotis, or according to some Tutola, advised them to do <lb/>
            neither, but by a stratagem to avoid both war and surrender <lb/>
            of the women. This stratagem was that they should dress <lb/>
            Philotis and the. best looking of the other female slaves like <lb/>
            free women, and send them to the enemy; then at night <lb/>
            Philotis said she would raise a torch, and the Romans <lb/>
            should come under arms and fall upon the sleeping enemy. <lb/>
            This was done, and terms were made with the Latins. <lb/>
            Philotis raised the torch upon a certain fig-tree with <lb/>
            leaves which spread all round and behind, in such a <lb/>
            manner that the light could not be seen by the enemy, <lb/>
            but was clearly seen by the Romans. When they saw it, <lb/>
            they immediately rushed out, calling frequently for each <lb/>
            other at the various gates in their eagerness. As they fell <lb/>
            unexpectedly upon the enemy, they routed them, and <lb/>
            keep the day as a feast. Therefore the Nones are called <lb/>
            Caprotinæ because of the fig-tree, which the Romans call <lb/>
            caprificus, and the women are feasted out of doors, under <lb/>
            the shade of fig-tree boughs. And the female slaves <lb/>
            assemble and play, and afterwards beat and throw stones <lb/>
            at each other, as they did then, when they helped the <lb/>
            Romans to fight. These accounts are admitted by but <lb/>
            few historians, and indeed the calling out one another's <lb/>
            names in the daytime, and walking down to the Goats' <lb/>
            Marsh seems more applicable to the former story, unless, <lb/>
            indeed, both of these events happened on the same day.</p>
          <p>Romulus is said to have been fifty-four years old, and <lb/>
            to be in the thirty-eighth year of his reign when he <lb/>
            disappeared from the world.</p>

            <title type="main">COMPARISON OF THESEUS AND ROMULUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>L THE above are all the noteworthy particulars which we <lb/>
            have been able to collect about Theseus and Romulus. It <lb/>
            seems, in the first place, that Theseus of his own freewill, <lb/>
            and without any compulsion, when he might have reigned <lb/>
            peacefully in Trœzen, where he was heir to the kingdom, <lb/>
            no mean one, longed to accomplish heroic deeds: whereas <lb/>
            Romulus was an exile, and in the position of a slave ; the <lb/>
            fear of death was hanging over him if unsuccessful, and <lb/>
            so, as Plato says, he was made brave by sheer terror, and <lb/>
            through fear of suffering death and torture was forced. <lb/>
            into doing great exploits. Moreover, Romulus's greatest <lb/>
            achievement was the slaying of one man, the despot of <lb/>
            Alba, whereas Skeiron, Sinis, Prokrustes, and Korynetes <lb/>
            were merely the accompaniments and prelude to the <lb/>
            greater actions of Theseus, and by slaying them he freed <lb/>
            Greece from terrible scourges, before those whom he saved <lb/>
            even knew who he was. He also might have sailed peace­ <lb/>
            fully over the sea to Athens, and had no trouble with those <lb/>
            brigands, whereas Romulus could not be free from trouble <lb/>
            while Amulius lived. And it is a great argument in <lb/>
            favour of Theseus that he attacked those wicked men for <lb/>
            the sake of others, having himself suffered no wrong <lb/>
            at their hands; whereas the twins were unconcerned at <lb/>
            Amulius's tyranny so long as it did not affect themselves. <lb/>
            And although it may have been a great exploit to receive <lb/>
            a wound in fighting the Sabines, and to slay Acron, and to <lb/>
            kill many enemies in battle, yet we may compare with <lb/>
            these, on Theseus's behalf, his battle with the Centaurs and <lb/>
            his campaign against the Amazons. As for the courage <lb/>
            which Theseus showed in the matter of the Cretan tribute, <lb/>
            when he voluntarily sailed to Crete with the youths and <lb/>
            maidens, whether the penalty was to be given to th? <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            Minotaur to eat, or be sacrificed at the tomb of Androgens, <lb/>
            or even to be cast into dishonoured slavery under an <lb/>
            insolent enemy, which is the least miserable fate mentioned <lb/>
            by any writer, what a strength of mind, what public <lb/>
            spirit and love of fame it shows I In this instance it seems <lb/>
            to me that philosophers have truly defined love as a <lb/>
            “ service designed by the gods for the care and preservation <lb/>
            of the young." For the love of Ariadne seems to have <lb/>
            been specially intended by Heaven to save Theseus; <lb/>
            nor need we blame her for her passion, but rather <lb/>
            wonder that all men and women did not share it. <lb/>
            If she alone felt it, then I say she deserved the love <lb/>
            of a god, because of her zeal for all that is best and <lb/>
            noblest.</p>
          <p>II. Both were born statesmen, yet neither behaved <lb/>
            himself as a king should do, but, from similar motives, <lb/>
            the one erred on the side of democracy, the other on that <lb/>
            of despotism. The first duty of a king is to preserve his <lb/>
            crown; and this can be effected as well by refraining <lb/>
            from improperly extending his rights as by too great <lb/>
            eagerness to keep them. For he who either gives up <lb/>
            or overstrains his prerogative ceases to be a king or <lb/>
            constitutional ruler, but becomes either a despot or dema­ <lb/>
            gogue ; and in the one case is feared, in the other despised <lb/>
            by his subjects. Still the one is the result of kindli­ <lb/>
            ness of disposition, and the other that of selfishness and <lb/>
            ferocity.</p>
          <p>III. If we are not to attribute their misfortunes to <lb/>
            chance, but to peculiarities of disposition, then we cannot <lb/>
            acquit Romulus of blame in his treatment of his brother, <lb/>
            nor Theseus in that of his son; but the greatest excuse <lb/>
            must be made for the one who acted under the greatest <lb/>
            provocation. One would not have thought that Romulus <lb/>
            would have flown into such a passion during a grave <lb/>
            deliberation on matters of state; while Theseus was misled, <lb/>
            in his treatment of his son, by love and jealousy and a <lb/>
            woman's slander, influences which few men are able to <lb/>
            withstand. And what is more, Romulus's fury resulted in <lb/>
            actual deeds of unfortunate result; whereas the anger of <lb/>
            Theseus spent itself in words and an old man's curses, and <lb/>
            the youth seems to have owed the rest of his suffering to <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            chance; so here, at any rate, one would give one'a vote for <lb/>
            Theseus.</p>
          <p>IV. Romulus, however, has the credit of having started <lb/>
            with the most slender resources, and yet of having suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded. The twins were called slaves and the sons of a <lb/>
            swineherd before they achieved their liberty; yet they <lb/>
            freed nearly all the Latin race, and at one and the same <lb/>
            time gained those titles which are the most glorious among <lb/>
            men, of slayers of their enemies, preservers of their own <lb/>
            house, kings of their own nation, and founders of a new <lb/>
            city, not by transferring the population of old ones, as <lb/>
            Theseus did, when he brought together many towns into <lb/>
            one, and destroyed many cities that bore the names of <lb/>
            kings and heroes of old. Romulus did this afterwards, <lb/>
            when he compelled his conquered enemies to cast down <lb/>
            and obliterate their own dwellings, and become fellow- <lb/>
            citizens with their conquerors; yet at first he did not <lb/>
            change the site of his city nor increase it, but starting <lb/>
            with nothing to help him, he obtained for himself terri­ <lb/>
            tory, patrimony, sovereignty, family, marriage, and rela­ <lb/>
            tives, and he killed no one, but conferred great benefits <lb/>
            on those who, instead of homeless vagrants, wished to <lb/>
            become a people and inhabitants of a city. He slew no <lb/>
            brigands or robbers, but he conquered kingdoms, took <lb/>
            cities, and triumphed over kings and princes.</p>
          <p>V. As for the misfortune of Remus, it seems doubtful <lb/>
            whether Romulus slew him with his own hand, as most <lb/>
            writers attribute the act to others. He certainly rescued <lb/>
            his mother from death, and gloriously replaced his grand­ <lb/>
            father, whom he found in an ignoble and servile position, <lb/>
            on the throne of Æneas. He did him many kindnesses, <lb/>
            and never harmed him even against his will. But I can <lb/>
            scarcely imagine that Theseus's forgetfulness and careless­ <lb/>
            ness in hoisting the black sail can, by any excuses or before <lb/>
            the mildest judges, come much short of parricide : indeed, <lb/>
            an Athenian, seeing how hard it is even for his admirers <lb/>
            to exculpate him, has made up a story that Ægeus, when <lb/>
            the ship was approaching, hurriedly ran up to the acropolis <lb/>
            to view it, and fell down, as though he were unattended, <lb/>
            or would hurry along the road to the shore without <lb/>
            servants.</p><pb n="65"/>
            
          <p>VI. The crimes of Theseus in carrying off women are <lb/>
            without any decent excuse; first, because he did it so often, <lb/>
            for he carried off Ariadne and Antiope and Anaxo of <lb/>
            Trœzen, and above ail when he was an old man he carried <lb/>
            off Helen, when she was not yet grown up, and a mere child, <lb/>
            though he was past the age for even legitimate marriage. <lb/>
            Besides, there was no reason for it, for these Troezenian, <lb/>
            Laconian, and Amazonian maidens, besides their not <lb/>
            being betrothed to him, were no worthier mothers for his <lb/>
            children than the Athenian daughters of Erechtheus and <lb/>
            Kekrops would have been, so we must suspect that these <lb/>
            acts were done out of mere riotous wantonness.</p>
          <p>Now Romulus, though he carried off nearly eight <lb/>
            hundred women, yet kept only one, Hersilia, for himself, <lb/>
            and distributed the others among the unmarried citizens ; <lb/>
            and afterwards, by the respect, love, and justice with <lb/>
            which he treated them, proved that his wrongful violence <lb/>
            was the most admirable and politic contrivance for <lb/>
            effecting the union of the two nations. By means of it <lb/>
            he welded them into one, and made it the starting-point <lb/>
            of harmony at home and strength abroad. The dignity, <lb/>
            love, and permanence with which he invested the in­ <lb/>
            stitution of marriage is proved by the fact that during <lb/>
            two hundred and thirty years no man separated from <lb/>
            his wife or woman from her husband; but, just as in <lb/>
            Greece, very exact persons can mention the first instance <lb/>
            of parricide or matricide, so all the Romans know that <lb/>
            Spurius Carvilius was the first who put away his wife, <lb/>
            upon a charge of barrenness. Events also testify to the <lb/>
            superior wisdom of Romulus, for, in consequence of that <lb/>
            intermarriage, the two kings and the two races shared the <lb/>
            empire, whereas, from the marriage of Theseus, the Athen­ <lb/>
            ians obtained no alliance or intercourse with any nation, <lb/>
            but only hatreds and wars and deaths of citizens and at <lb/>
            last the destruction of Aphidnae, and they themselves <lb/>
            escaped from the fate which Paris brought upon Troy, <lb/>
            only by the mercy of their enemies and their own <lb/>
            entreaties and supplications. The mother of Theseus, not <lb/>
            nearly but quite, suffered the fate of Hekuba, who was <lb/>
            abandoned and given up by her son, unless the story of <note type="footnote"> F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            her captivity is false, as I hope it is, together with much <lb/>
            of the rest.</p>
          <p>Also the religious part of their histories makes a great <lb/>
            distinction between them. For Romulus's success was <lb/>
            due to the great favour of Heaven, whereas the oracle <lb/>
            given to Ægeus, to refrain from all women in foreign <lb/>
            parts, seems to argue that the birth of Theseus took place <lb/>
            contrary to the will of the <unclear>gods</unclear>.</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF LYKURGUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. WITH regard to Lykurgus the lawgiver there is nothing <lb/>
            whatever that is undisputed ; as his birth, his travels, his <lb/>
            death, and, besides all this, his legislation, have all been <lb/>
            related in various ways; ant also the dates of his birth do <lb/>
            not in any way accord. Some say that he was contemporary <lb/>
            with Iphitus, and with him settled the conditions of the <lb/>
            Olympic truce; and among these is Aristotle the philoso­ <lb/>
            pher, who adduces as a proof of it the quoit which is at <lb/>
            Olympia, on which the name of Lykurgus is still preserved. <lb/>
            Others, among them Eratosthenes and Apollodorus, by <lb/>
            computing the reigns of the kings of Sparta,* prove that <lb/>
            he must have lived many years before the first Olympiad. <lb/>
            Timseus conjectures that there were two men of the name <lb/>
            of Lykurgus in Sparta at different times, and that the deeds <lb/>
            of both are attributed to one of them, on account of his <lb/>
            celebrity. The elder, he thinks, must have lived not far <lb/>
            off the time of Homer; indeed some say that he came intc <lb/>
            the presence of Homer. Xenophon gives an idea of his <lb/>
            antiquity when he speaks of him as living in the time of the <lb/>
            Herakleidæ. By descent of course the last kings of Sparta <lb/>
            are Herakleidæ, but he appears to mean by Herakleidæ <lb/>
            the earliest of all, who were next to Herakles himself.</p>
          <p>However, in spite of these discrepancies, we will <lb/>
            endeavour, by following the least inconsistent accounts <note type="footnote"> * In the Spartan constitution there were two kings, who were be­ <lb/>
            lieved to be descended from two brothers, Eurysthenes and Prokles, <lb/>
            the two sons of Aristodemus. When the descendants of Herakl* s <lb/>
            returned to Peloponnesus, and divided that country amongst them, <lb/>
            Lacedaemon fell to the lot of Aristodemus, who left his two sons joint <lb/>
            heirs to the monarchy. The kings of Sparta bad little real power, <lb/>
            and to this no doubt they owed the fact of their retaining their <lb/>
            dignity when every other Hellenic state adopted a de mocratic form of <lb/>
            government. </note> <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            and the best known authorities, to write the history of his <lb/>
            life. Simonides the poet tells us that the father of <lb/>
            Lykurgus was not Eunomus, but Prytanis. But most <lb/>
            writers do not deduce his genealogy thus, but say that <lb/>
            Soüs was the son of Prokles, and grandson of Aristodemus, <lb/>
            and that Soüs begat Euripus; Euripus, Prytanis, and <lb/>
            Prytanis, Eunomus. Eunomus had two sons, Polydektes <lb/>
            by his first wife, and Lykurgus by his second wife <lb/>
            Dionassa, which makes him, according to Dieutychides, <lb/>
            sixth in descent from Prokles, and eleventh from Herakles.</p>
          <p>II. The most remarkable of his ancestors was Soüs, in <lb/>
            whose reign the Spartans enslaved the Helots, and annexed <lb/>
            a large portion of Arcadia. It is said that Soils once was <lb/>
            besieged by the Kleitorians, in a fort where there was no <lb/>
            water, and was compelled to conclude a treaty to restore <lb/>
            the territory in dispute, if he and his men were permitted <lb/>
            to drink at the nearest spring. After this had been agreed <lb/>
            upon, he called his men together, and offered his kingdom <lb/>
            to any one who could refrain from drinking. But as no <lb/>
            one could do this, but all drank, last of all he himself came <lb/>
            down to the spring, and in the presence of the enemy <lb/>
            merely sprinkled his face with the water, and marched off, <lb/>
            refusing to restore the disputed territory, on the ground <lb/>
            that all did not drink. But though he gained great fame <lb/>
            by this, yet it was not he but his son Eurypon who gave <lb/>
            the name of Eurypontidæ to the family, because Eurypon <lb/>
            was the first to relax the despotic traditions of his family <lb/>
            and render his government more popular with the people. <lb/>
            But as a consequence of this the people were encouraged to <lb/>
            demand more freedom, and great confusion and lawlessness <lb/>
            prevailed in Sparta for a long time, because some of the <lb/>
            kings opposed the people and so became odious, while others <lb/>
            were found to yield to them, either to preserve their <lb/>
            popularity, or from sheer weakness of character. It was <lb/>
            during this period of disorder that the father of Lykurgus <lb/>
            lost his life. He was endeavouring to part two men who <lb/>
            were quarrelling, and was killed by a blow from a cook's <lb/>
            chopper, leaving the kingdom to his elder son Polydektes.</p>
          <p>III. He also died after a short time, and, as all thought, <lb/>
            Lykurgus ought to have been the next king. And he did <lb/>
            indeed reign until his brother's wife was found to be <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            pregnant; but as soon as he heard this, he surrendered the <lb/>
            crown to the child, if it should be a boy, and merely <lb/>
            administered the kingdom as guardian for the child. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian name for the guardian of a royal orphan is <lb/>
            prodiMus. Now the queen made a secret proposal to him, <lb/>
            that she should destroy her infant and that they should <lb/>
            live together as king and queen. Though disgusted at her <lb/>
            wickedness, he did not reject the proposal, but pretended <lb/>
            to approve of it. He said that she must not risk her life <lb/>
            and injure her health by procuring abortion, but that he <lb/>
            would undertake to do away with the child. Thus he <lb/>
            deluded her until her confinement, at which time he sent <lb/>
            officials and guards into her chamber with orders to hand <lb/>
            the child over to the women if it was a girl, and to bring it <lb/>
            to him, whatever he might be doing, if it was a boy. He <lb/>
            happened to be dining with the archons when a male child <lb/>
            was born, and the servants brought it to him. He is said <lb/>
            to have taken the child and said to those present, “A king <lb/>
            is born to you, 0 Spartans," and to have laid him down in <lb/>
            the royal seat and named him Charilaus, because all men <lb/>
            were full of joy admiring his spirit and justice. He was <lb/>
            king for eight months in all; and was much looked up to <lb/>
            by the citizens, who rendered a willing obedience to him, <lb/>
            rather because of his eminent virtues than because he was <lb/>
            regent with royal powers. There was, nevertheless, a <lb/>
            faction which grudged him his elevation, and tried to <lb/>
            oppose him, as he was a young man.</p>
          <p>They consisted chiefly of the relatives and friends of the <lb/>
            queen-mother, who considered that she had been insult­ <lb/>
            ingly treated, and her brother Leonidas once went so far <lb/>
            in his abusive language as to hint to Lykurgus that he <lb/>
            knew that he meant to bo king, throwing the suspicion <lb/>
            upon Lykurgus, if anything should happen to the child, <lb/>
            that he would be supposed to have managed it. This sort <lb/>
            of language was used by the queen-mother also, and he, <lb/>
            grieved and alarmed, decided to avoid all suspicion by <lb/>
            leaving the country and travelling until his nephew should <lb/>
            be grown up and have an heir born to succeed him.</p>
          <p>IV. With this intention he set sail, and first came to <lb/>
            Crete, where he studied the constitution and mixed with <lb/>
            the leading statesmen. Some part of their laws he <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            approved and made himself master of, with the intention <lb/>
            of adopting them on his return home, while with others <lb/>
            he was dissatisfied. One of the men who had a reputation <lb/>
            there for learning and state-craft he made his friend, and <lb/>
            induced him to go to Sparta. This was Thales, who was <lb/>
            thought to be merely a lyric poet, and who used this art <lb/>
            to conceal his graver acquirements, being in reality deeply <lb/>
            versed in legislation. His poems were exhortations to <lb/>
            unity and concord in verse, breathing a spirit of calm and <lb/>
            order, which insensibly civilised their hearers and by <lb/>
            urging them to the pursuit of honourable objects led them <lb/>
            to lay aside the feelings of party strife so prevalent in <lb/>
            Sparta; so that he may be said in some degree to have <lb/>
            educated the people and prepared them to receive the <lb/>
            reforms of Lykurgus.</p>
          <p>From Crete Lykurgus sailed to Asia Minor, wishing, it <lb/>
            is said, to contrast the thrifty and austere mode of life of <lb/>
            the Cretans with the extravagance and luxury of the <lb/>
            lanians, as a physician compares healthy and diseased <lb/>
            bodies, and to note the points of difference in the two <lb/>
            states. There, it seems, he first met with the poems of <lb/>
            Homer, which were preserved by the descendants of <lb/>
            Kreophylus, and observing that they were no less useful <lb/>
            for politics and education than for relaxation and pleasure, <lb/>
            he eagerly copied and compiled them, with the intention <lb/>
            of bringing them home with him. There was already <lb/>
            some dim idea of the existence of these poems among the <lb/>
            Greeks, but few possessed any portions of them, as they <lb/>
            were scattered in fragments, but Lykurgus first made them <lb/>
            known. The Egyptians suppose that Lykurgus visited <lb/>
            them also, and that he especially admired their institution <lb/>
            of a separate caste of warriors. This he transferred to <lb/>
            Sparta, and, by excluding working men and the lower <lb/>
            classes from the government, made the city a city <lb/>
            indeed, pure from all admixture. Some Greek writers <lb/>
            corroborate the Egyptians in this, but as to Lykurgus <lb/>
            having visited Libya and Iberia, or his journey to India <lb/>
            and meeting with the Gymnosophists, or naked philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, there, no one that we know of tells this except the <lb/>
            Sp irtan Aristokrates, the son of Hipparchus.</p>
          <p>V. During Lykurgus's absence the Lacedaemonians re­ <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            gretted him and sent many embassies to ask him to return, <lb/>
            telling him that their kings had indeed the royal name <lb/>
            and state, but nothing else to distinguish them from the <lb/>
            common people, and that he alone had the spirit of a ruler <lb/>
            and the power to influence men's minds. Even the kings <lb/>
            desired his presence, as they hoped that he would assist in <lb/>
            establishing their authority and would render the masses <lb/>
            less insolent. Returning to a people in this condition, he <lb/>
            at once began alterations and reforms on a sweeping scale, <lb/>
            considering that it was useless and unprofitable to do such <lb/>
            work by halves, but that, as in the case of a diseased body, <lb/>
            the original cause of the disorder must be burned out or <lb/>
            purged away, and the patient begin an entirely new life. <lb/>
            After reflecting on this, he made a journey to Delphi. <lb/>
            Here he sacrificed to the god, and, on consulting the oracle, <lb/>
            received that celebrated answer in which the Pythia speaks <lb/>
            of him as beloved by the gods, and a god rather than a <lb/>
            man, and when he asked for a good system of laws. answered <lb/>
            that the god gives him what will prove by far the best of <lb/>
            all constitutions. Elated by this he collected the leading <lb/>
            men and begged them to help him, first by talking <lb/>
            privately to his own friends, and thus little by little <lb/>
            obtaining a hold over more men and banding them together <lb/>
            for the work. When the time was ripe for the attempt, <lb/>
            he bade thirty of the nobles go into the market-place early <lb/>
            in the morning completely armed, in order to overawe the <lb/>
            opposition. The names of twenty of the most distinguished <lb/>
            of these men have been preserved by Hermippus, but the <lb/>
            man who took the greatest part in all Lykurgus's works, <lb/>
            and who helped him in establishing his laws, was Arthmia­ <lb/>
            des. At first King Charilaus was terrified at the confusion, <lb/>
            imagining that a revolt had broken out against himself, <lb/>
            and fled for refuge to the temple of Minerva of the Brazen <lb/>
            House; but, afterward reassured and having received <lb/>
            solemn pledges for his safety, returned and took part in <lb/>
            their proceedings. He was of a gentle nature, as is proved <lb/>
            by the words of his colleague, King Archelaus, who, when <lb/>
            some were praising the youth, said, " How can Charilaus <lb/>
            be a good man, if he is not harsh even to wicked men ?"</p>
          <p>Of Lykurgus's many reforms, the first and most impor­ <lb/>
            tant was the establishment of the Council of Elders, which <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            Plato says by its admixture cooled the high fever of royalty, <lb/>
            and, having an equal vote with the kings on vital points, <lb/>
            gave caution and sobriety to their deliberations. For the <lb/>
            state, which had hitherto been wildly oscillating between <lb/>
            despotism on the one hand and democracy on the other, <lb/>
            now, by the establishment of the Council of the Elders, <lb/>
            found a firm footing between these extremes, and was able <lb/>
            to preserve a most equable balance, as the eight-and-twenty <lb/>
            elders would lend the kings their support in the suppres­ <lb/>
            sion of democracy, but would use the people to suppress <lb/>
            any tendency to despotism. Twenty-eight is the number <lb/>
            of Elders mentioned by Aristotle, because of the thirty <lb/>
            leading men who took the part of Lykurgus two deserted <lb/>
            their post through fear. But Sphairus says that those <lb/>
            who shared his opinions were twenty-eight originally. A <lb/>
            reason may be found in twenty-eight being a mystic <lb/>
            number, formed by seven multiplied by four, and being <lb/>
            the first perfect number after six, for like that, it is equal <lb/>
            to all its parts.. But I think that he probably made this <lb/>
            number of elders, in order that with the two kings the <lb/>
            council might consist of thirty members in all.</p>
          <p>VI. Lykurgus was so much interested in this council as <lb/>
            to obtain from Delphi an oracle about it, called the rheira, <lb/>
            which runs as follows: " After you have built a temple <lb/>
            to Zeus of Greece and Athene of Greece, and have divided <lb/>
            the people into tribes and obes, you shall found a council <lb/>
            of thirty, including the chiefs, and shall from season <lb/>
            to season apellazein the people between Babyka and <lb/>
            Knakion, and there propound measures and divide upon <lb/>
            them, and the people shall have the casting vote and final <lb/>
            decision. In these words tribes and obes are divisions <lb/>
            into which the people were to be divided; the chiefs <lb/>
            mean the kings; apellazein means to call an assembly, in <lb/>
            allusion to Apollo, to whom the whole scheme of the con­ <lb/>
            stitution is referred. Babyka and Knakion they now call <lb/>
            Oinous; but Aristotle says that Knakion is a river and <lb/>
            Babyka a bridge. Between these they held their assemblies, <lb/>
            without any roof or building of any kind; for Lykurgus <lb/>
            did not consider that deliberations were assisted by archi­ <lb/>
            tecture, but rather hindered, as men's heads were thereby <note type="footnote"> * 14, 2, 7, 4, 1, make by addition 28; as 3, 2, and 1 make 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            filled with vain unprofitable fancies, when they assemble <lb/>
            for debate in places where they can see statues and paint­ <lb/>
            ings, or the proscenium of a theatre, or the richly orna­ <lb/>
            mented roof of a council chamber. When the people were <lb/>
            assembled, he permitted no one to express an opinion; but <lb/>
            the people was empowered to decide upon motions brought <lb/>
            forward by the kings and elders. But in later times, as <lb/>
            the people made additions and omissions, and so altered the <lb/>
            sense of the motions before them, the kings, Polydorus and <lb/>
            Theopompus, added these words to the rhetra, “ and if the <lb/>
            people shall decide crookedly, the chiefs and elders shall <lb/>
            set it right." That is, they made the people no longer <lb/>
            supreme, but practically excluded them from any voice <lb/>
            in public affairs, on the ground that they judged wrongly. <lb/>
            However these kings persuaded the city that this also was <lb/>
            ordained by the god. This is mentioned by Tyrtæus in <lb/>
            the following verses: <lb/>
            “ They heard the god, and brought from Delphi home, <lb/>
            Apollo's oracle, which thus did say : <lb/>
            That over all within fair Sparta's realm <lb/>
            The royal chiefs in council should bear sway, <lb/>
            The elders next to them, the people last; <lb/>
            If they the holy rhetra would obey."</p>
          <p>VII. Though Lykurgus had thus mixed the several <lb/>
            powers of the state, yet his successors, seeing that the <lb/>
            powers of the oligarchy were unimpaired, and that it was, <lb/>
            as Plato calls it, full of life and vigour, placed as a curb to <lb/>
            it the power of the Ephors. The first Ephors, of whom <lb/>
            Elatus was one, were elected about a hundred and thirty <lb/>
            years after Lykurgus, in the reign of Theopompus. This <lb/>
            king is said to have been blamed by his wife because he <lb/>
            would transmit to his children a less valuable crown than <lb/>
            he had received, to which he answered: " Nay, more <lb/>
            valuable, because more lasting." In truth, by losing the <lb/>
            odium of absolute power, the King of Sparta escaped all <lb/>
            danger of being dethroned, as those of Argos and Messene <lb/>
            were by their subjects, because they would abate nothing <lb/>
            of their despotic power. The wisdom of Lykurgus became <lb/>
            clearly manifest to those who witnessed the revolutions <lb/>
            and miseries of the Argives and Messenians, who were <lb/>
            neighbouring states and of the same race as the Spartans, <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            who, originally starting on equal terms with them, and <lb/>
            indeed seeming in the allotment of their territories to have <lb/>
            some advantage, yet did not long live happily, but the <lb/>
            insolent pride of the kings and the unruly temper of the <lb/>
            people together resulted in a revolution, which clearly <lb/>
            proved that the checked and balanced constitution estab­ <lb/>
            lished among the Spartans was a divine blessing for them. <lb/>
            But of this more hereafter.</p>
          <p>VIII. The second and the boldest of Lykurgus's reforms <lb/>
            was the redistribution of the land. Great inequalities <lb/>
            existed, many poor and needy people had become a burden <lb/>
            to the state, while wealth had got into a very few hands. <lb/>
            Lykurgus abolished all the mass of pride, envy, crime, and <lb/>
            luxury which flowed from those old and more terrible <lb/>
            evils of riches and poverty, by inducing all land-owners to <lb/>
            offer their estates for redistribution, and prevailing upon <lb/>
            them to live on equal terms one with another, and with <lb/>
            equal incomes, striving only to surpass each other in <lb/>
            courage and virtue, there being henceforth no social <lb/>
            inequalities among them except such as praise or blame <lb/>
            can create.</p>
          <p>Putting his proposals immediately into practice, he <lb/>
            divided the outlying lands of the state among the Perioeki, <lb/>
            in thirty thousand lots, and that immediately adjoining <lb/>
            the metropolis among the native Spartans, in nine thousand <lb/>
            lots, for to that number they then amounted. Some say <lb/>
            that Lykurgus made six thousand lots, and that Polydorus <lb/>
            added three thousand afterwards; others that he added <lb/>
            half the nine thousand, and that only half was allotted by <lb/>
            Lykurgus.</p>
          <p>Each man'a lot was of such a size as to supply a man <lb/>
            with seventy medimni of barley, and his wife with twelve, <lb/>
            and oil and wine in proportion ; for thus much he thought <lb/>
            ought to suffice them, as the food was enough to maintain <lb/>
            them in health, and they wanted nothing more. It is <lb/>
            said that, some years afterwards, as he was returning from <lb/>
            a journey through the country at harvest-time, when he <lb/>
            saw the sheaves of corn lying in equal parallel rows, he <lb/>
            smiled, and said to his companions that all Laconic seemed <lb/>
            as if it had just been divided among so many brothers.</p>
          <p>IX. He desired to distribute furniture also, in order <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            completely to do away with inequality; but, seeing that <lb/>
            actually to take away these things would be a most un­ <lb/>
            popular measure, he managed by a different method to put <lb/>
            an end to all ostentation in these matters. First of all he <lb/>
            abolished the use of gold and silver money, and made iron <lb/>
            money alone legal; and this he made of great size and <lb/>
            weight, and small value, so that the equivalent for ten <lb/>
            minæ required a great room for its stowage, and a yoke of <lb/>
            oxen to draw it. As soon as this was established, many <lb/>
            sorts of crime became unknown in Lacedæmon. For who <lb/>
            would steal or take as a bribe or deny that he possessed or <lb/>
            take by force a mass of iron which he could not conceal, <lb/>
            which no one envied him for possessing, which he could <lb/>
            not even break up and so make use of; for the iron when <lb/>
            hot was, it is said, quenched in vinegar, so as to make it <lb/>
            useless, by rendering it brittle and hard to work ?</p>
          <p>After this, he ordered a general expulsion of the workers <lb/>
            in useless trades. Indeed, without this, most of them must <lb/>
            have left the country when the ordinary currency came to <lb/>
            an end, as they would not be able to sell their wares: for <lb/>
            the iron money was not current among other Greeks, and <lb/>
            had no value, being regarded as ridiculous; so that it <lb/>
            could not be used for the purchase of foreign trumpery, <lb/>
            and no cargo was shipped for a Laconian port, and there <lb/>
            came into the country no sophists, no vagabond soothsayers, <lb/>
            no panders, no goldsmiths or workers in silver plate, <lb/>
            because there was no money to pay them with. Luxury, <lb/>
            thus cut off from all encouragement, gradually became <lb/>
            extinct; and the rich were on the same footing with <lb/>
            other people, as they could find no means of display, but <lb/>
            were forced to keep their money idle at home. For this <lb/>
            reason such things as are useful and necessary, like couches <lb/>
            and tables and chairs, were made there better than any­ <lb/>
            where else, and the Laconian cup, we are told by Kritias, <lb/>
            was especially valued for its use in the field. Its colour <lb/>
            prevented the drinker being disgusted by the look of the <lb/>
            dirty water which it is sometimes necessary to drink, and <lb/>
            it was contrived that the dirt was deposited inside the cup <lb/>
            and stuck to the bottom, so as to make the drink cleaner <lb/>
            than it would otherwise have been. These things were <lb/>
            due to the lawgiver; for the workmen, who were not allowed <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            to make useless things, devoted their best workmanship to <lb/>
            useful ones.</p>
          <p>X. Wishing still further to put down luxury and take <lb/>
            away the desire for riches, he introduced the third and <lb/>
            the most admirable of his reforms, that of the common <lb/>
            dining-table. At this the people were to meet and dine <lb/>
            together upon a fixed allowance of food, and not to live in <lb/>
            their own homes, lolling on expensive couches at rich <lb/>
            tables, fattened like beasts in private by the hands of <lb/>
            servants and cooks, and undermining their health by in­ <lb/>
            dulgence to excess in every bodily desire, long sleep, warm <lb/>
            baths, and much repose, so that they required a sort of <lb/>
            daily nursing like sick people. This was a great advantage, <lb/>
            but it was a greater to render wealth valueless, and, as <lb/>
            Theophrastus says, to neutralise it by their common dining- <lb/>
            table and the simplicity of their habits. Wealth could <lb/>
            not be used, nor enjoyed, nor indeed displayed at all in <lb/>
            costly apparatus, when the poor man dined at the same <lb/>
            table with the rich; so that the well-known saying, that <lb/>
            “ wealth is blind and lies like a senseless log," was seen to <lb/>
            be true in Sparta alone of all cities under heaven. Men <lb/>
            were not even allowed to dine previously at home, and <lb/>
            then come to the public table, but the others, watching <lb/>
            him who did not eat or drink with them, would reproach <lb/>
            him as a sensual person, too effeminate to eat the rough <lb/>
            common fare.</p>
          <p>For these reasons it is said that the rich were bitterly <lb/>
            opposed to Lykurgus on this question, and that they <lb/>
            caused a tumult and attacked him with shouts of rage. <lb/>
            Pelted with stones from many hands, he was forced to run <lb/>
            out of the market-place, and take sanctuary in a temple. <lb/>
            He outstripped all his pursuers except one, a hot-tempered <lb/>
            and spirited youth named Alkander, who came up with <lb/>
            him, and striking him with a club as he turned round, <lb/>
            knocked out his eye. Lykurgus paid no heed to the <lb/>
            pain, but stood facing the citizens and showed them his <lb/>
            face streaming with blood, and his eye destroyed. All <lb/>
            who saw him were filled with shame and remorse. They <lb/>
            gave up Alkander to his mercy, and conducted him in <lb/>
            procession to his own house, to show their sympathy. <lb/>
            Lykurgus thanked them and dismissed them, but took <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            Alkander home with him. He did him no harm and used <lb/>
            no reproachful words, but sent away all his servants and <lb/>
            bade him serve him. Alkander, being of a generous <lb/>
            nature, did as he was ordered, and, dwelling as he did <lb/>
            with Lykurgus, watching his kind unruffled temper, his <lb/>
            severe simplicity of life, and his unwearied labours, he <lb/>
            became enthusiastic in his admiration of him, and used to <lb/>
            tell his friends and acquaintances that Lykurgus, far from <lb/>
            being harsh or overbearing, was the kindest and gentlest <lb/>
            of men. Thus was Alkander tamed and subdued, so that <lb/>
            he who had been a wicked and insolent youth was made <lb/>
            into a modest and prudent man.</p>
          <p>As a memorial of his misfortune, Lykurgus built the <lb/>
            temple of Athene, whom he called Optilitis, for the <lb/>
            Dorians in that country call the eyes optiloi. Some <lb/>
            writers, however, among whom is Dioskorides, who wrote an <lb/>
            ‘ Account of the Spartan Constitution,' say that Lykurgus <lb/>
            was struck upon the eye, but not blinded, and that he <lb/>
            built this temple as a thank-offering to the goddess for his <lb/>
            recovery.</p>
          <p>At any rate, it was in consequence of his mishap that <lb/>
            the Spartans discontinued the habit of carrying staffs <lb/>
            when they met in council.</p>
          <p>XI. The Cretans call this institution of taking meals <lb/>
            in common andreia, which means men's repast; but the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians call it phiditia, which can either be ex­ <lb/>
            plained as another form of philia, friendship, putting a d <lb/>
            for an l, from the friendly feelings which prevailed at <lb/>
            them, or else because it accustomed them to frugality, <lb/>
            which is called pheido. Possibly the first letter was an <lb/>
            addition, and the word may have originally been editio, <lb/>
            from edodé, food.</p>
          <p>They formed themselves into messes of fifteen, more or <lb/>
            lees. Each member contributed per month a medimnus of <lb/>
            barley, eight measures of wine, five minas' weight of <lb/>
            cheese, and half as much of figs; and in addition to this a <lb/>
            very small sum of money to buy fish and other luxuries <lb/>
            for a relish to the bread. This was all, except when a <lb/>
            man had offered a sacrifice, or been hunting, and sent <lb/>
            a portion to the public table. For persons were allowed <lb/>
            to dine at home whenever they were late for dinner in <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            consequence of a sacrifice or a hunting expedition, but the <lb/>
            rest of the company had to be present. This custom of <lb/>
            eating in common lasted for very many years. When <lb/>
            King Agis returned from his victorious campaign against <lb/>
            the Athenians, and wished to dine at home with his wife, <lb/>
            he sent for his share of the public dinner, and the <lb/>
            polemarchs refused to let him have it. As next day, <lb/>
            through anger, he did not offer the customary sacrifice, <lb/>
            they fined him. Boys were taken to the public tables, as <lb/>
            though they were schools of good manners; and there <lb/>
            they listened to discourses on politics, and saw models of <lb/>
            gentlemanly behaviour, and learned how to jest with one <lb/>
            another, joking without vulgarity, and being made the <lb/>
            subjects of jokes without losing their temper. Indeed, it <lb/>
            was considered peculiarly Laconian to be able to take a <lb/>
            joke; however, if the victim could not, he was entitled to <lb/>
            ask that it should go no farther. As they came in, the <lb/>
            eldest present said to each man, pointing to the door, <lb/>
            " Through this no tale passes."</p>
          <p>It is said that they voted for a new member of a mess <lb/>
            in this manner. Each man took a piece of bread crumb <lb/>
            and threw it in silence into a vessel, which a servant <lb/>
            carried on his head. Those who voted for the new <lb/>
            member threw in their bread as it was, those who voted <lb/>
            against, crushed it flat in their hands. If even one of <lb/>
            these crushed pieces be found, they rejected the candidate, <lb/>
            as they wished all members of the society to be friendly. <lb/>
            The candidate was said to be rejected by the kaddichus, <lb/>
            which is their name for the bowl into which the bread is <lb/>
            thrown.</p>
          <p>The “ black broth" was the most esteemed of their <lb/>
            luxuries, insomuch that the elder men did not care for <lb/>
            any meat, but always handed it over to the young, and <lb/>
            regaled themselves on this broth. It is related that, in <lb/>
            consequence of the celebrity of this broth, one of the kings <lb/>
            of Pontus obtained a Laconian cook, but when he <lb/>
            tasted it he did not like it. His cook thereupon said, " 0 <lb/>
            king, those who eat this broth must first bathe in the <lb/>
            Eurotas." After drinking wine in moderation the guests <lb/>
            separate, without any torches; for it is not permitted to <lb/>
            walk with a light on this or any other occasion, in order <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            that they may accustom themselves to walk fearlessly and <lb/>
            safely in the dark. This then is the way in which the <lb/>
            common dining-tables are managed.</p>
          <p>XII. Lykurgus did not establish any written laws; <lb/>
            indeed, this is distinctly forbidden by one of the so-called <lb/>
            Rhetras.</p>
          <p>He thought that the principles of most importance for <lb/>
            the prosperity and honour of the state would remain most <lb/>
            securely fixed if implanted in the citizens by habit and <lb/>
            training, as they would then be followed from choice <lb/>
            rather than necessity; for his method of education made <lb/>
            each of them into a lawgiver like himself. The trifling <lb/>
            conventions of everyday life were best left undefined by <lb/>
            hard-and-fast laws, so that they might from time to time <lb/>
            receive corrections or additions from men educated in the <lb/>
            spirit of the Lacedæmonian system. On this education <lb/>
            the whole scheme of Lykurgus's laws depended. One <lb/>
            rhetra, as we have seen, forbade the use of written laws. <lb/>
            Another was directed against expenditure, and ordered <lb/>
            that the roof of every house should consist of beams <lb/>
            worked with the axe, and that the doors should be worked <lb/>
            with the saw alone, and with no other tools. Lykurgus <lb/>
            was the first to perceive the truth which Epameinondas is <lb/>
            said in later times to have uttered about his own table, <lb/>
            when he said that such a dinner has no room for treachery." <lb/>
            He saw that such a house as that has no place for luxury <lb/>
            and expense, and that there is no man so silly and taste­ <lb/>
            less as to bring couches with silver feet, purple hangings, <lb/>
            or golden goblets into a simple peasant's house, but that <lb/>
            he would be forced to make his furniture match the house, <lb/>
            and his clothes match his furniture, and so on. In <lb/>
            consequence of this it is said that the elder Leotychides <lb/>
            when dining in Corinth, after looking at a costly <lb/>
            panelled ceiling, asked his host whether the trees grew <lb/>
            square in that country. A third rhetra of Lykurgus is <lb/>
            mentioned, which forbids the Spartans to make war <lb/>
            frequently with the same people, lest by constant practice <lb/>
            they too should become warlike. And this especial accusa­ <lb/>
            tion was subsequently brought against King Agesilaus in <lb/>
            later times, that, by his frequent and long-continued <lb/>
            invasions of Bœotia, he made the Thebans a match for the <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            Lacedaemonians ; for which cause Antalkidas, when he <lb/>
            saw him wounded, said, " The Thebans pay you well for <lb/>
            having taught them to fight, which they were neither <lb/>
            willing nor able to do before."</p>
          <p>Maxims of this sort they call rhetras, which are supposed <lb/>
            -tohave a divine origin and sanction.</p>
          <p>XIII. Considering education to be the most important <lb/>
            and the noblest work of a lawgiver, he began at the very <lb/>
            beginning, and regulated marriages and the birth of <lb/>
            children. It is not true that, as Aristotle says, he en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to regulate the lives of the women, and failed, <lb/>
            being foiled by the liberty and habits of command which <lb/>
            they had acquired by the long absences of their husbands <lb/>
            on military expeditions, during which they were necessarily <lb/>
            left in sole charge at home, wherefore their husbands <lb/>
            looked up to them more than was fitting, calling them <lb/>
            Mistresses; but he made what regulations were necessary <lb/>
            for them also. He strengthened the bodies of the girls by <lb/>
            exercise in running, wrestling, and hurling quoits or <lb/>
            javelins, in order that their children might spring from a <lb/>
            healthy source and so grow up strong, and that they <lb/>
            themselves might have strength, so as easily to endure the <lb/>
            pains of childbirth. He did away with all affectation of <lb/>
            seclusion and retirement among the women, and ordained <lb/>
            that the girls, no less than the boys, should go naked in <lb/>
            processions, and dance and sing at festivals in the presence <lb/>
            of the young men. The jokes which they made upon <lb/>
            each man were sometimes of great value as reproofs for <lb/>
            ill-conduct; while, on the other hand, by reciting verses <lb/>
            written in praise of the deserving, they kindled a <lb/>
            wonderful emulation and thirst for distinction in the <lb/>
            young men: for he who had been praised by the maidens <lb/>
            for his valour went away congratulated by his friends; <lb/>
            while, on the other hand, the raillery which they used in <lb/>
            sport and jest had as keen an edge as a serious reproof; <lb/>
            because the kings and elders were present at these festivals <lb/>
            as well as all the other citizens. This nakedness of the <lb/>
            maidens had in it nothing disgraceful, as it was done <lb/>
            modestly, not licentiously, producing simplicity, and <lb/>
            teaching the women to value good health, and to love <lb/>
            honour and courage no less than the men. This it was <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            that made them speak and think as we are told, Gorgo, <lb/>
            the wife of Leonidas, did. Somo foreign lady, it seems, <lb/>
            said to her, " You Laconian women are the only ones <lb/>
            that rule men." She answered, “ Yes; for we alone bring <lb/>
            forth men."</p>
          <p>XIV. These were also incentives to marriage, I mean <lb/>
            these processions, and strippings, and exercises of the <lb/>
            maidens in the sight of the young men, who, as Plato says, <lb/>
            are more swayed by amorous than by mathematical con­ <lb/>
            siderations ; moreover, he imposed certain penalties on the <lb/>
            unmarried men. They were excluded from the festival of <lb/>
            the Gymnopædia, in honour of Athene; and the magis­ <lb/>
            trates ordered them during winter to walk naked round <lb/>
            the market-place, and while doing so to sing a song <lb/>
            written against themselves, which said that they were <lb/>
            rightly served for their disobedience to the laws; and <lb/>
            also they were deprived of the respect and observance <lb/>
            paid by the young to the elders.</p>
          <p>Thus it happened that no one blamed the young man <lb/>
            for not rising before Derkyllidas, famous general as he <lb/>
            was. This youth kept his seat, saying, “ You have not <lb/>
            begotten a son to rise before me."</p>
          <p>Their marriage custom was for the husband to carry off <lb/>
            his bride by force. They did not carry off little immature <lb/>
            girls, but grown up women, who were ripe for marriage. <lb/>
            After the bride had been carried off the bridesmaid <lb/>
            received her, cut her hair close to her head, dressed her in <lb/>
            a man's cloak and shoes, and placed her upon a couch in a <lb/>
            dark chamber alone. The bridegroom, without any feasting <lb/>
            and revelry, but as sober as usual, after dining at his mess, <lb/>
            comes into the room, looses her virgin zone, and, after <lb/>
            passing a short time with her, retires to pass the night <lb/>
            where he was wont, with the other young men. And <lb/>
            thus he continued, passing his days with his companions, <lb/>
            and visiting his wife by stealth, feeling ashamed and <lb/>
            afraid that any one in the house should hear him, she on <lb/>
            her part plotting and contriving occasions for meeting un­ <lb/>
            observed. This went on for a long time, so that some <lb/>
            even had children born to them before they ever saw <lb/>
            their wives by daylight. These connections not only <lb/>
            exercised their powers of self-restraint, but also brought <note type="footnote"> e </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            them together with their bodies in full vigour and their <lb/>
            passions unblunted by unchecked intercourse with each <lb/>
            other, so that their passion and love for each other'is <lb/>
            society remained unextinguished.</p>
          <p>Having thus honoured and dignified the married state, <lb/>
            he destroyed the vain womanish passion of jealousy, for, <lb/>
            while carefully avoiding any disorder or licentiousness, he <lb/>
            nevertheless permitted men to associate worthy persona <lb/>
            with them in the task of begetting children, and taught <lb/>
            them to ridicule those who insisted on the exclusive <lb/>
            possession of their wives, and who were ready to fight and <lb/>
            kill people to maintain their right. It was permitted to <lb/>
            an elderly husband, with a young wife, to associate with <lb/>
            himself any well-born youth whom he might fancy, and <lb/>
            to adopt the offspring as his own.</p>
          <p>And again, it was allowable for a respectable man, if he <lb/>
            felt any admiration for a virtuous mother of children, <lb/>
            married to some one else, to induce her husband to permit <lb/>
            him to have access to her, that he might as it were sow seed <lb/>
            in a fertile field, and obtain a fine son from a healthy <lb/>
            stock. Lykurgus did not view children as belonging <lb/>
            to their parents, but above all to the state; and <lb/>
            therefore he wished his citizens to be born of the best <lb/>
            possible parents; besides the inconsistency and folly <lb/>
            which he noticed in the customs of the rest of mankind, <lb/>
            who are willing to pay money, or use their influence with <lb/>
            the owners of well-bred stock, to obtain a good breed of <lb/>
            horses or dogs, while they lock up their women in seclusion <lb/>
            and permit them to have children by none but themselves, <lb/>
            even though they be mad, decrepit, or diseased; just as <lb/>
            if the good or bad qualities of children did not depend <lb/>
            entirely upon their parents, and did not affect their <lb/>
            parents more than any one else.</p>
          <p>But although men lent their wives in order to produce <lb/>
            healthy and useful citizens, yet this was so far from the <lb/>
            licence which was said to prevail in later times with <lb/>
            respect to women, that adultery was regarded amongst <lb/>
            them as an impossible crime. A story is told of one <lb/>
            Geradas, a very old Spartan, who, when asked by a <lb/>
            stranger what was done to adulterers among them, <lb/>
            answered, “ Stranger, there are no adulterers with us." <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            “ And if there were one ? " asked the stranger. " Then," <lb/>
            said Geradas, " he would have to pay as compensation a <lb/>
            bull big enough to stand on Mount Täygetus and drink <lb/>
            from the river Eurotas." The stranger, astonished, asked <lb/>
            " Where can you find so big a bull ? " " Where can you <lb/>
            find an adulterer in Sparta?" answered Geradas. This <lb/>
            is what is said about their marriage ceremonies.</p>
          <p>XV.A father had not the right of bringing up his off­ <lb/>
            spring, but had to carry it to a certain place called Lesche, <lb/>
            where the elders of the tribe sat in judgment upon the <lb/>
            child. If they thought it well-built and strong, they <lb/>
            ordered the father to bring it up, and assigned one of the <lb/>
            nine thousand plots of land to it; but if it was mean­ <lb/>
            looking or misshapen, they sent it away to the place called <lb/>
            the Exposure, a glen upon the side of Mount Täygetus ; <lb/>
            for they considered that if a child did not start in possession <lb/>
            of health and strength, it was better both for itself and for <lb/>
            the state that he should not live at all. Wherefore the <lb/>
            women used to wash their newborn infants with wine, not <lb/>
            with water, to make trial of their constitution. It was <lb/>
            thought that epileptic or diseased children shrank from <lb/>
            the wine and fell into convulsions, while healthy ones <lb/>
            were hardened and strengthened by it. A certain super­ <lb/>
            vision was exercised over the nurses, making them bring <lb/>
            up the children without swaddling clothes, so as to make <lb/>
            their movements free and unconfined, and also to make <lb/>
            them easily satisfied, not nice as to food, not afraid in the <lb/>
            dark, not frightened at being alone, not peevish and fret­ <lb/>
            ful. For this reason, many foreigners used to obtain <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian nurses for their children, and it is said that <lb/>
            Amykla, the nurse of Alkibiades, was a Lacedæmonian. <lb/>
            But Plato tells us that Perikles put him under the care of <lb/>
            one Zopyrus, who was no better than the other slaves; <lb/>
            whereas Lykurgus would not intrust the Spartan boys to <lb/>
            any bought or hired servants, nor was each man allowed <lb/>
            to bring up and educate his son as he chose, but as soon as <lb/>
            they were seven years of age he himself received them <lb/>
            from their parents, and enrolled them in companies. Here <lb/>
            they lived and messed in common, and were associated for <lb/>
            play and for work. However, a superintendent of the <lb/>
            boys was appointed, one of the best born and bravest men <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            of the state, and they themselves in their troops chose as <lb/>
            leader him who was wisest, and fiercest in fight. They <lb/>
            looked to him for orders, obeyed his commands, and en­ <lb/>
            dured his punishments, so that even in childhood they <lb/>
            learned to obey. The elder men watched them at their <lb/>
            play, and by instituting fights and trials of strength, care­ <lb/>
            fully learned which was the bravest and most enduring. <lb/>
            They learned their letters, because they are necessary, but <lb/>
            all the rest of their education was meant to teach them to <lb/>
            obey with cheerfulness, to endure labours, and to win <lb/>
            battles. As they grew older their training became more <lb/>
            severe; they were closely shorn, and taught to walk un­ <lb/>
            shod and to play naked. They wore no tunic after their <lb/>
            twelfth year, but received one garment for all the year <lb/>
            round. They were necessarily dirty, as they had no warm <lb/>
            baths and ointments, except on certain days, as a luxury. <lb/>
            They slept all together in troops and companies, on beds <lb/>
            of rushes which they themselves had picked on the banks <lb/>
            of the Eurotas with their hands, for they were not allowed <lb/>
            to use a knife. In winter they mixed the herb called <lb/>
            lycophon with the rushes, as it is thought to possess some <lb/>
            warmth.</p>
          <p>XVI. At this age the elder men took even greater <lb/>
            interest in them, frequenting the gymnasia where they <lb/>
            were, and listening to their repartees with each other, and <lb/>
            that not in a languid careless manner, but just as if each <lb/>
            thought himself the father, instructor, and captain of them <lb/>
            all.</p>
          <p>Thus no time was left unemployed, and no place was <lb/>
            left without some one to give good advice and punish <lb/>
            wrong-doing; although a regular superintendent of the <lb/>
            boys was appointed from the leading men of the city, and <lb/>
            they had their own chiefs, who were the wisest and bravest <lb/>
            of the Eirenes. This is a name given to those who have <lb/>
            begun their second year after ceasing to be children, and <lb/>
            the eldest of the children are called Melleirenes. This <lb/>
            Eiren, who is twenty years old, commands his company <lb/>
            in their battles, and in the house uses them as his servants <lb/>
            to prepare dinner. He orders the bigger boys to carry. <lb/>
            logs of wood, and the little ones to gather pot herbs. <lb/>
            They also bring him what they steal, which they do, some <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            from the gardens, and some from the men's dining-tables, <lb/>
            where they rush in very cleverly and cautiously; for if <lb/>
            one be taken, he is severely scourged for stealing carelessly <lb/>
            and clumsily. They also steal what victuals they can, <lb/>
            learning to take them from those who are asleep or off <lb/>
            their guard. Whoever is caught is punished by stripes <lb/>
            and starvation. Their meals are purposely made scanty, <lb/>
            in order that they may exercise their ingenuity and daring <lb/>
            in obtaining additions to them. This is the main object <lb/>
            of their short commons, but an incidental advantage is <lb/>
            the growth of their bodies, for they shoot up in height <lb/>
            when not weighed down and made wide and broad by <lb/>
            excess of nutriment. This also is thought to produce <lb/>
            beauty of figure; for lean and slender frames develop <lb/>
            vigour in the limbs, whereas those which are bloated and <lb/>
            over-fed cannot attain this, from their weight. This we <lb/>
            see in the case of women who take purgatives during <lb/>
            pregnancy, whose children are thin, but well-shaped and <lb/>
            slender, because from their slight build they receive more <lb/>
            distinctly the impress of their mother's form. However, <lb/>
            it may be that the cause of this phenomenon is yet to be <lb/>
            discovered.</p>
          <p>XVII. The boys steal with such earnestness that there <lb/>
            is a story of one who had taken a fox's cub and hidden it <lb/>
            under his cloak, and, though his entrails were being torn <lb/>
            out by the claws and teeth of the beast, persevered in <lb/>
            concealing it until he died. This may be believed from <lb/>
            what the young men in Lacedæmon do now, for at the <lb/>
            present day I have seen many of them perish under the <lb/>
            scourge at the altar of Diana Orthias.</p>
          <p>After dinner the Eiren would recline, and bid one of tho <lb/>
            boys sing, and ask another some questions which demand <lb/>
            a thoughtful answer, such as “ Who is the best among <lb/>
            men ? " or " How is such a thing done ? " By this teaching <lb/>
            they began even in infancy to be able to judge what is <lb/>
            right, and to be interested in politics; for not to be able <lb/>
            to answer the questions, " Who is a good citizen ? " or “ Who <lb/>
            is a man of bad repute ? " was thought to be the sign of <lb/>
            a stupid and unaspiring mind. The boy'is answer was <lb/>
            required to be well reasoned, and put into a small com­ <lb/>
            pass ; he who answered wrongly was punished by having <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            his thumb bitten by the Eiren. Often when elders and <lb/>
            magistrates were present the Eiren would punish the boys; <lb/>
            if only he showed that it was done deservedly and with <lb/>
            method, he never was checked while punishing, but <lb/>
            when the boys were gone, he was called to account if he <lb/>
            had done so either too cruelly or too remissly.</p>
          <p>The lovers of the boys also shared their honour or <lb/>
            disgrace ; it is said that once when a boy in a fight let fall <lb/>
            an unmanly word, his lover was fined by the magis­ <lb/>
            trates. Thus was love understood among them ; for even <lb/>
            fair and honourable matrons loved young maidens, but none <lb/>
            expected their feelings to be returned. Rather did those <lb/>
            who loved the same person make it a reason for friendship <lb/>
            with each other, and vie with one another in trying to <lb/>
            improve in every way the object of their love.</p>
          <p>XVIII. The boys were taught to use a sarcastic yet <lb/>
            graceful style of speaking, and to compress much thought <lb/>
            into few words; for Lykurgus made the iron money have <lb/>
            little value for its great size, but on the other hand he <lb/>
            made their speech short and compact, but full of meaning, <lb/>
            teaching the young, by long periods of silent listening, to <lb/>
            speak sententiously and to the point. For those who <lb/>
            allow themselves much licence in speech seldom say any. <lb/>
            thing memorable. When some Athenian jeered at the <lb/>
            small Laconian swords, and said that jugglers on the stage <lb/>
            could easily swallow them, King Agis answered, " And yet <lb/>
            with these little daggers we can generally reach our <lb/>
            enemies." I think that the Laconian speech, though it <lb/>
            seems so short, yet shows a great grasp of the subject and <lb/>
            has great power over the listeners. Lykurgus himself <lb/>
            seems to have been short and sententious, to judge from <lb/>
            what has been preserved of his sayings; as, for instance, <lb/>
            that remark to one who proposed to establish a democracy <lb/>
            in the state, “ First establish a democracy in your own <lb/>
            household." And when he was asked why he ordained <lb/>
            the sacrifices to be so small and cheap, he answered, “ It is <lb/>
            in order that we may never be forced to omit them." So <lb/>
            too in gymnastic exercises, he discouraged all those which <lb/>
            are not performed with the hand closed.</p>
          <p>The same class of answers are said to have been made <lb/>
            by him to his fellow-countrymen in his letters. When they <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            asked how they should keep off their enemies, he answered, <lb/>
            “ By remaining poor, and not each trying to be a greater <lb/>
            man than the other." Again, about walls, he said, “ that <lb/>
            cannot be called an open town which has courage, instead <lb/>
            of brick walls to defend it." As to the authenticity of <lb/>
            these letters, it is hard to give an opinion.</p>
          <p>XIX.—The following anecdotes show their dislike of <lb/>
            long speeches. When some one was discoursing about mat­ <lb/>
            ters useful in themselves at an unfitting time, King Leonidas <lb/>
            said, " Stranger, you speak of what is wanted when it is <lb/>
            not wanted." Charilaus the cousin of Lykurgus, when <lb/>
            asked why they had so few laws, answered, that men of <lb/>
            few words required few laws. And Archidamidas, when <lb/>
            some blamed Hekatæus the Sophist for having said <lb/>
            nothing during dinner, answered, " He who knows how <lb/>
            to speak knows when to speak also." The following are <lb/>
            some of those sarcastic sayings which I before said are not <lb/>
            ungrateful. Demaratus, when some worthless fellow <lb/>
            pestered him with unreasonable queries, and several times <lb/>
            inquired, "Who is the best man in Sparta?" answered, <lb/>
            " He who is least like you." When some were praising <lb/>
            the magnificence and justice with which the Eleans con­ <lb/>
            ducted the Olympian games, Agis said, " What is there so <lb/>
            very remarkable in the people of Elis acting justly on one <lb/>
            day in every five years ? "</p>
          <p>A stranger was vaunting his admiration of them, and <lb/>
            was saying that in his own city he was called a lover of <lb/>
            Sparta. Theopompus observed, "It would be more to <lb/>
            your credit to be called a lover of your own city.” <lb/>
            Pleistoanax the son of Pausanias, when an Athenian <lb/>
            orator reproached the Lacedaemonians for ignorance, <lb/>
            observed, " What you say is quite true, for we are the <lb/>
            only Greeks who have not learned some mischief from <lb/>
            you."</p>
          <p>When a stranger asked Archidamidas how many <lb/>
            Spartans there were, he answered, " Enough to keep off <lb/>
            bad men.”</p>
          <p>One may also discover their peculiarities in their jokes; <lb/>
            for they are taught never to talk at random, nor to utter <lb/>
            a syllable that does not contain some thought. As, when <lb/>
            one of them was invited to hear a man imitate the night­ <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            ingale, he answered, " I have heard the original and tLo <lb/>
            man who read this epigram­ <lb/>
            “ These men, to quench a tyrant's pride, <lb/>
            Before Selinus fought and died.” <lb/>
            " These men, said he, “ deserved to die; for, instead of <lb/>
            quenching it, they should have let it burn itself out." <lb/>
            When a young man was promised a present of cocks that <lb/>
            would fight till they died, he said, “ I had rather have <lb/>
            some that will fight and kill their foes." This was the <lb/>
            style of their talk; so that some have well said that <lb/>
            philosophy is more truly Laconian than gymnastic <lb/>
            exercises.</p>
          <p>XX.—Their education in poetry and music was no less <lb/>
            carefully watched over than their cleverness and purity <lb/>
            of speech, but their songs were such as rouse men's blood <lb/>
            and stir them to deeds of prowess, written in plain unaffected <lb/>
            language, upon noble and edifying subjects. For the <lb/>
            most part they consisted of panegyrics upon those who <lb/>
            had been happy enough to die for their country, reproaches <lb/>
            of cowards for living a miserable life, and encouragement <lb/>
            to bravery suitable to those of all ages. A good instance <lb/>
            of this is that on festivals when there are three choruses, <lb/>
            that of the old men first sang­ <lb/>
            “ We once were lusty youths and tan.” <lb/>
            Then that of the young men sang­ <lb/>
            “ We still are stout; come, try a fall," <lb/>
            and the third, that of the children, rejoined­ <lb/>
            u But well be stronger than you alL" <lb/>
            Indeed, if one pays any attention to such Laconian <lb/>
            poetry as is still extant, and to the march music which <lb/>
            was played on the flutes when they were going to meet <lb/>
            their enemies, it becomes clear that Terpander and Pindar <lb/>
            were right in connecting poetry with bravery. The <lb/>
            former speaks thus of the Lacedaemonians : <lb/>
            “ Where the youths are bold with the spear, <lb/>
            And the voice of the muse is clear, <lb/>
            And justice to all is dear.” <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            And Pindar says of them­ <lb/>
            “ Where the old are wise in council, <lb/>
            And the young are brave in fight; <lb/>
            Where song and dance are honoured <lb/>
            On many a festal night" <lb/>
            For they represent them as being most warlike and at the <lb/>
            same time most poetical. <lb/>
            “ The sword with song full well combines," <lb/>
            as the Laconian poet says. Even in their battles the <lb/>
            king first sacrificed to the Muses, to remind them, it <lb/>
            would appear, of their education and their former contests, <lb/>
            that they may be bold in danger, and do deeds worthy of <lb/>
            record in the fight.</p>
          <p>XXI.—In time of war, too, they relaxed their strict <lb/>
            rules and allowed their young men to dress their hair and <lb/>
            ornament their shields and costumes, taking a pride in <lb/>
            them such as one does in high-mettled horses. For this <lb/>
            reason, although they all let their hair grow long after <lb/>
            the age of puberty, yet it was especially in time of danger <lb/>
            that they took pains to have it smooth and evenly parted, <lb/>
            remembering a saying of Lykurgus about the hair, that <lb/>
            it made a well-looking man look handsomer, and an ugly <lb/>
            man look more ferocious.</p>
          <p>During a campaign they made the young men perform <lb/>
            less severe gymnastic exercises, and allowed them to live a <lb/>
            freer life in other respects, so that, for them alone of all <lb/>
            mankind, war was felt as a relief from preparation for war. <lb/>
            When their array was formed and the enemy were in <lb/>
            sight, the king used to sacrifice a kid, and bid them all <lb/>
            , put on garlands, and the pipers to play the hymn to Kastor ; <lb/>
            then he himself began to sing the pæan for the charge, so <lb/>
            that it was a magnificent and terrible spectacle to see the <lb/>
            men marching in time to the flutes, making no gap in <lb/>
            their lines, with no thought of fear, but quietly and <lb/>
            steadily moving to the sound of the music against the <lb/>
            enemy. Such men were not likely to be either panic- <lb/>
            stricken or over-confident, but had a cool and cheerful <lb/>
            confidence, believing that the gods were with them.</p><pb n="90"/>
            
          <p>With the king used to march into battle a Spartan. <lb/>
            who had won a crown in the public games of Greece. It <lb/>
            is said that one of them was offered a mighty bribe at <lb/>
            Olympia, but refused to take it, and with great trouble <lb/>
            threw his adversary in the wrestling-match. Some one <lb/>
            then asked him, " Laconian, what have you gained. <lb/>
            by your victory?" The man, smiling with delight,, <lb/>
            answered, " I shall fight in front of the king in the wars." <lb/>
            After they had routed their enemy and gained the <lb/>
            victory, they were wont to pursue so far as to render their <lb/>
            success secure, and then to draw off, as they did not think: <lb/>
            it manly or befitting a Greek to cut down and butcher <lb/>
            those who could fight no longer.</p>
          <p>This was not merely magnanimous, but very useful to <lb/>
            them, for their enemies, knowing that they slew those <lb/>
            who resisted, but spared those who gave way, often judged <lb/>
            it better for themselves to flee than to stand their ground.</p>
          <p>XXII. The sophist Hippias states that Lykurgus <lb/>
            himself was a great warrior and took part in many cam­ <lb/>
            paigns; and Philostephanus even attributed to Lykur­ <lb/>
            gus the division of the cavalry into the troops called <lb/>
            oulamo8. This, according to him, consisted of a troop <lb/>
            of fifty horsemen drawn up in a square. Demetrius Phale­ <lb/>
            reus, on the other hand, says that he had no experience in <lb/>
            war, and arranged the whole constitution in time of peace. <lb/>
            Moreover the institution of the Olympic truce seems to be <lb/>
            the idea of a man of gentle and peaceful temperament, some <lb/>
            however say, according to Hermippus, that Lykurgus had <lb/>
            at first no communication with Iphitus, but happened to <lb/>
            be present in the crowd; that he then heard a voice as it <lb/>
            were of a man behind him blaming him and wondering <lb/>
            why he did not encourage his fellow-citizens to take part <lb/>
            in the festival. As, when he turned round, there was no <lb/>
            one who could have said so, he concluded that it was a <lb/>
            divine warning, and, at once joining Iphitus and assisting <lb/>
            him in regulating the festival, he rendered it both more <lb/>
            splendid and more lasting.</p>
          <p>XXIII. The training of the Spartan youth continued <lb/>
            till their manhood. No one was permitted to live <lb/>
            according to his own pleasure, but they lived in the city <lb/>
            as if in a camp, with a fixed diet and fixed public duties, <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            thinking themselves to belong, not to themselves, but to <lb/>
            their country. Those who had nothing else to do, either <lb/>
            looked after the young, and taught them what was useful, <lb/>
            or themselves learned such things from the old. For <lb/>
            ample leisure was one of the blessings with which <lb/>
            Lykurgus provided his countrymen, seeing that they were <lb/>
            utterly forbidden to practise any mechanical art, while <lb/>
            money-making and business were unnecessary, because <lb/>
            wealth was disregarded and despised. The Helots tilled <lb/>
            the ground, and produced the regular crops for them. <lb/>
            Indeed, a Spartan who was at Athens while the courts <lb/>
            were sitting, and who learned that some man had been <lb/>
            fined for idleness, and was leaving the court in sorrow <lb/>
            accompanied by his grieving friends, asked to be shown <lb/>
            the man who had been punished for gentlemanly behaviour. <lb/>
            So slavish did they deem it to labour at trade and business. <lb/>
            In Sparta, as was natural, lawsuits became extinct, <lb/>
            together with money, as the people had neither excess nor <lb/>
            deficiency, but all were equally well off, and enjoyed <lb/>
            abundant leisure by reason of their simple habits. All <lb/>
            their time was spent in dances, feasting, hunting or <lb/>
            gymnastic exercises and conversation, when they were not <lb/>
            engaged in war.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Those who were less than thirty years old never <lb/>
            came into the market-place at all, but made their necessary <lb/>
            purchases through their friends and relations. And it was <lb/>
            thought discreditable to the older men to be seen there <lb/>
            much, and not to spend the greater part of the day in the <lb/>
            gymnasium and the leaches or places for conversation. <lb/>
            Inthese they used to collect together and pass their <lb/>
            leisure time, making no allusions to business or the affairs <lb/>
            of commerce, but their chief study being to praise what <lb/>
            was honourable, and contemn what was base in a light <lb/>
            satiric vein of talk which was instructive and edifying to <lb/>
            the hearers. Nor was Lykurgus himself a man of <lb/>
            unmixed austerity : indeed, he is said by Sosibius to have <lb/>
            set up the little statue of the god of laughter, and intro­ <lb/>
            duced merriment at proper times to enliven their wine­ <lb/>
            parties and other gatherings. In a word, he trained his <lb/>
            countrymen neither to wish nor to understand how to live <lb/>
            as private men, but, like bees, to be parts of the common­ <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            wealth, and gather round their chief, forgetting themselves <lb/>
            in their enthusiastic patriotism, and utterly devoted to <lb/>
            their country. This temper of theirs we can discern in <lb/>
            many of their sayings. Paidaretus, when not elected <lb/>
            into the three hundred, went away rejoicing that the <lb/>
            city possessed three hundred better men than himself. <lb/>
            Polykratidas, when he went with some others on a mission <lb/>
            to the generals of the great king, was asked by them, if <lb/>
            he and his party came as private persons or as ambassadors ? <lb/>
            He answered, " As ambassadors, if we succeed; as private <lb/>
            men, if we fail."</p>
          <p>And when some citizens of Amphipolis came to <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, and went to see the mother of Brasidas, <lb/>
            Argileonis, she asked them whether Brasidas died <lb/>
            bravely and worthily of Sparta. When they praised him <lb/>
            to excess, and said that he had not left his like behind, she <lb/>
            said, " Say not so, strangers ; Brasidas was a noble and a <lb/>
            gallant man, but Sparta has many better than he."</p>
          <p>XXV. Lykurgus himself composed his senate, as we <lb/>
            have seen, of the persons who took part in his plot; and <lb/>
            in future be ordained that vacancies should be filled up by <lb/>
            those men, upwards of sixty years of age, who were <lb/>
            adjudged to be the most worthy.</p>
          <p>This seemed the greatest prize in the world, and also <lb/>
            the most difficult to obtain ; for it was not merely that a <lb/>
            man should be adjudged swiftest of the swift, or strongest <lb/>
            of the strong, but he had to be chosen as the best and <lb/>
            wisest of all good and wise men, and, as a prize, was to <lb/>
            obtain power to regulate the morals of the state, as he was <lb/>
            intrusted with powers of life and death, and disfranchise­ <lb/>
            ment, and with all the highest penalties.</p>
          <p>The elections took place as follows: The citizens were <lb/>
            all assembled, and certain men were placed in a building <lb/>
            close by, where they could neither see nor be seen but <lb/>
            merely hear the shouts of the general assembly. They <lb/>
            decided these, as indeed they did other contests, by shouts <lb/>
            of approval, not of all at once, but lots were cast, and <lb/>
            each candidate in the order denoted by his lot came <lb/>
            forward and silently walked through the assembly. The <lb/>
            men locked up in the building had writing materials, and <lb/>
            noted down who was cheered most loudly, not knowing <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            who each man was, beyond that he was first, second, third, <lb/>
            and so on, of the candidates. They then told the number <lb/>
            of the man for whom there had been most voices, and he <lb/>
            crowned himself with a garland and offered sacrifice to <lb/>
            the gods, followed by many of the young men, who <lb/>
            congratulated him, and by many women, who sang songs <lb/>
            praising his virtues and his felicity. As he went from <lb/>
            one temple to another, each of his relatives used to offer <lb/>
            him food, saying, "The state honours you with this <lb/>
            banquet." But he would pass by them all, and go to his <lb/>
            usual mess-table. Here nothing uncommon took place, <lb/>
            except that he was given a second ration, which he took <lb/>
            away with him; and after dinner, the women of his own <lb/>
            family being at the doors of the mess-room, he would call <lb/>
            for the one whom he wished to honour, and give her his <lb/>
            portion, saying that he had received it as a prize, and <lb/>
            gave it to her as such. This caused her to be greatly <lb/>
            envied by the other women.</p>
          <p>XXVI.—Moreover, he made excellent regulations <lb/>
            about funerals. In the first place, he abolished all silly <lb/>
            superstition, and raised no objections to burial in the city, <lb/>
            and to placing tombs near the temples, in order to <lb/>
            accustom the young to such sights from their infancy, so <lb/>
            that they might not feel any horror of death, or have any <lb/>
            notion about being defiled by touching a dead body, or <lb/>
            walking among tombs. Next, he permitted nothing to be <lb/>
            buried with the dead, but they placed the body in the <lb/>
            grave, wrapped in a purple cloth and covered with olive- <lb/>
            leaves. It was not permitted to inscribe the name of the <lb/>
            deceased upon his tomb, except in the case of men who <lb/>
            had fallen in war, or of women who had been priestesses. <lb/>
            A short time was fixed for mourning, eleven days ; on the <lb/>
            twelfth they were to sacrifice to Demeter (Ceres) and <lb/>
            cease from their grief. For, in Sparta, nothing was left <lb/>
            without regulation, but, with all the necessary acts of life, <lb/>
            Lykurgus mingled some ceremony which might enkindle <lb/>
            virtue or discourage vice; indeed he filled his city with <lb/>
            examples of this kind, by which the citizens were in­ <lb/>
            sensibly moulded and impelled towards honourable pur­ <lb/>
            suits. For this reason he would not allow citizens to <lb/>
            leave the country at pleasure, and to wandor in foreign <lb/>
            lands, where they would contract outlandish habits, and <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            learn to imitate the untrained lives and in-regulated <lb/>
            institutions to be found abroad. Also, he banished from <lb/>
            Lacedæmon all strangers who were there for no useful <lb/>
            purpose; not, as Thucydides says, because he feared they <lb/>
            might imitate his constitution, and learn something <lb/>
            serviceable for the improvement of their own countries, <lb/>
            but rather for fear that they might teach the people some <lb/>
            mischief. Strangers introduce strange ideas; and these <lb/>
            lead to discussions of an unsuitable character, and political <lb/>
            views which would jar with the established constitution, <lb/>
            like a discord in music. Wherefore he thought that it was <lb/>
            more important to keep out evil habits than even to keep <lb/>
            the plague from coming into the city.</p>
          <p>XXVII. In all these acts of Lykurgus, we cannot find <lb/>
            any traces of the injustice and unfairness which some <lb/>
            complain of in his laws, which they say are excellent to <lb/>
            produce courage, but less so for justice. And the in­ <lb/>
            stitution called Krypteia, if indeed it is one of the laws of <lb/>
            Lykurgus, as Aristotle tells us, would agree with the idea <lb/>
            which Plato conceived about him and his system. The <lb/>
            Krypteia was this: the leaders of the young men used at <lb/>
            intervals to send the most discreet of them into different <lb/>
            parts of the country, equipped with daggers and necessary <lb/>
            food; in the daytime these men used to conceal themselves <lb/>
            in unfrequented spots, and take their rest, but at night <lb/>
            they would come down into the roads and murder any <lb/>
            Helots they found. And often they would range about <lb/>
            the fields and make away with the strongest and bravest <lb/>
            Helots they could find. Also, as Thucydides mentions in <lb/>
            his History of the Peloponnesian War, those Helots who <lb/>
            were especially honoured by the Spartans for their valour <lb/>
            were crowned as free men, and taken to the temples with <lb/>
            rejoicings ; but in a short time they all disappeared, to the <lb/>
            number of more than two thousand, and in such a way <lb/>
            that no man, either then or afterwards, could tell how they <lb/>
            perished. Aristotle says that the Ephors, when they first <lb/>
            take office, declare war against the Helots, in order that it <lb/>
            may be lawful to destroy them. And much other harsh <lb/>
            treatment used to be inflicted upon them; and they were <lb/>
            compelled to drink much unmixed wine, and then were <lb/>
            brought into the public dining-halls, to show the young <lb/>
            what drunkenness is.</p><pb n="95"/>
            
          <p>They were also forced to sing low songs, and to dance <lb/>
            low dances, and not to meddle with those of a higher <lb/>
            character. It is said that when the Thebans made their <lb/>
            celebrated campaign in Lacedaemon, they ordered the <lb/>
            Helots whom they captured to sing them the songs of <lb/>
            Terpander, and Alkman, and Spend on the Laconian; but <lb/>
            they begged to be excused, for, they said, “ the masters do <lb/>
            not like it." So it seems to have been well said that in <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, the free man was more free, and the slave <lb/>
            more a slave than anywhere else. This harsh treatment, I <lb/>
            imagine, began in later times, especially after the great <lb/>
            earthquake, when they relate that the Helots joined the <lb/>
            Messenians, ravaged the country, and almost conquered it. <lb/>
            I cannot impute this wicked act of the Krypteia to <lb/>
            Lykurgus, when I consider the gentleness and justice of <lb/>
            his general behaviour, which also we know was inspired <lb/>
            by Heaven.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. When the leading men of the city were <lb/>
            thoroughly imbued with the spirit of his institutions, and <lb/>
            the newly constituted state was able to walk by itself <lb/>
            without leading-strings, and bear its own weight alone, <lb/>
            then, as Plato says of God, that he was pleased with the <lb/>
            world that he had created, when it first began to live and <lb/>
            move, so was it with Lykurgus. He admired the spectacle of <lb/>
            his laWS in operation, and, as far as was possible by human <lb/>
            prudence, he desired to leave it eternal and unchangeable. <lb/>
            He assembled all the citizens, and told them that the city <lb/>
            was now fairly well provided with materials for happiness <lb/>
            and virtue, but that he would not bestow upon them the <lb/>
            most valuable gift of all, until he had taken counsel with <lb/>
            Heaven. It was therefore their duty to abide by the <lb/>
            already established laws, and to change and alter nothing <lb/>
            till he returned from Delphi; on his return, he would do <lb/>
            whatever the god commanded. They all assented, and <lb/>
            bade him depart, and he, after making first the kings <lb/>
            and elders, and then the rest of the citizens, swear that <lb/>
            they would keep their existing constitution till Lykurgus <lb/>
            came back, set out for Delphi. Upon reaching the temple <lb/>
            he sacrificed to the god, and inquired whether his laws <lb/>
            were good, and sufficient for the prosperity and happiness <lb/>
            of his country. Receiving answer from the oracle that his <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            laws were indeed good, and that the city would become <lb/>
            famous if it kept the constitution of Lykurgus, he wrote <lb/>
            down this prophecy and sent it to Sparta. But he himself, <lb/>
            after offering a second sacrifice to the god, and having <lb/>
            embraced his friends and his son, determined not to release <lb/>
            his countrymen from their oath, but to put an end to his <lb/>
            own life, being at an age when, though life was still <lb/>
            pleasant, it seemed time to go to his rest, after having <lb/>
            excellently arranged all his people's affairs. He departed <lb/>
            by starvation, as he thought that a true statesman ought <lb/>
            to make even his death of service to the state, and not like <lb/>
            that of a private person, the useless end of an idle life. <lb/>
            His death came in the fulness of time, after he had done <lb/>
            an excellent work, and it was left as the guardian of all <lb/>
            the good that he had done, because the citizens had sworn <lb/>
            that they would abide by his constitution until he <lb/>
            returned to them. Nor was he deceived in his expect­ <lb/>
            ations; for the state was by far the most celebrated in <lb/>
            Greece, for good government at home and renown abroad, <lb/>
            during a period of five hundred years, under his con­ <lb/>
            stitution, which was kept unaltered by fourteen kings, <lb/>
            counting from himself down to Agis the son of Archidamus. <lb/>
            For the institution of Ephors was not a relaxation, but a <lb/>
            strengthening of the original scheme, and while it seemed <lb/>
            popular it really confirmed the power of the oligarchy.</p>
          <p>XXIX. But in the reign of Agis money found its way <lb/>
            into Sparta, and, after money, selfishness and greed for <lb/>
            gain came in, on account of Lysander, who, though him­ <lb/>
            self incorruptible, yet filled his country with luxury and <lb/>
            love of gold, as he brought back gold and silver from the <lb/>
            wars, and disregarded the laws of Lykurgus. Before this, <lb/>
            when those laws were in force, Sparta was like a wise and <lb/>
            practised warrior more than a city, or rather, she with her <lb/>
            simple staff and cloak, like Herakles with his lion-skin and <lb/>
            club, ruled over a willing Greece, deposed bad kings or <lb/>
            factions, decided wars, and crushed revolutions; and that, <lb/>
            too, often without moving a single soldier, but merely by <lb/>
            Bending a commissioner, who was at once obeyed, even <lb/>
            as bees collect and rank themselves in order when their <lb/>
            queen appears. Sparta then had so much order and <lb/>
            justice as to be able to supply her neighbours; and J <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            cannot understand those who say that the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            “ knew how to obey, but not how to rule; " nor that <lb/>
            story of some one who said to king Theopompus that the <lb/>
            safety of Sparta lay in her kings knowing how to rule. <lb/>
            “ Rather," he answered, “ in her citizens knowing how <lb/>
            to obey."</p>
          <p>They would not brook an incapable commander: their <lb/>
            very obedience is a lesson in the art of command; for a <lb/>
            good leader makes good followers, and just as it is the <lb/>
            object of the horse-breaker to turn out a gentle and tract­ <lb/>
            able horse, so it is the object of rulers to implant in men <lb/>
            the spirit of obedience. But the Lacedaemonians produced <lb/>
            a desire in other states to be ruled by them and to obey <lb/>
            them; for they used to send embassies and ask not for <lb/>
            ships or money or troops, but for one Spartan for a leader ; <lb/>
            and when they obtained him, they respected him and <lb/>
            feared him, as, for instance, the Sicilians had Gylippus as <lb/>
            a general, the people of Chalkidike had Brasidas, while <lb/>
            Lysander and Kallikratidas and Agesilaus were made use <lb/>
            of by all the Greeks in Asia Minor. These men were <lb/>
            called Regulators and Pacificators in each several state, <lb/>
            and the whole city of Sparta was regarded as a school and <lb/>
            example of orderly public life and of settled political insti­ <lb/>
            tutions. This was alluded to by Stratonikus when he said <lb/>
            in jest that the Athenians ought to conduct mysteries and <lb/>
            shows, the Eleans to be stewards at the games, and the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians to be beaten if the others did not do <lb/>
            right. This was not spoken seriously; but Antisthenes, <lb/>
            the Sokratic philosopher, was serious when he said of the <lb/>
            Thebans, who were in high spirits after their victory at <lb/>
            Leuktra, that they were as pleased as schoolboys who had <lb/>
            beaten their master.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Not that this was Lykurgus's main object, that his <lb/>
            country should dominate over as many other states as pos­ <lb/>
            sible ; but seeing that, in states as in individuals, happiness <lb/>
            is derived from virtue and single-mindedness, he directed <lb/>
            all his efforts to implant in his countrymen feelings of <lb/>
            honour, self-reliance, and self-control. These were also <lb/>
            taken as the basis of their constitution by Plato, Diogenes, <lb/>
            Zeno, and all who have written with any success upon this <lb/>
            subject. But they have left mere dissertations; Lykurgus <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            produced an inimitable constitution, confuted those who <lb/>
            complained of the unreality of the ‘ Essay on the True <lb/>
            Philosopher,' by showing them the spectacle of an entire <lb/>
            city acting like philosophers, and thereby obtained for him­ <lb/>
            self a greater reputation than that of any other Greek legis­ <lb/>
            lator at any period. For this reason Aristotle says that he <lb/>
            has less honour in Lacedæmon than he deserves, although <lb/>
            his memory is greatly respected ; for he has a temple, and <lb/>
            they sacrifice to him every year as if he was a god. It is <lb/>
            also said that after his remains were carried home, his <lb/>
            tomb was struck by lightning. This distinction befell <lb/>
            scarcely any other man of note except Euripides, who died <lb/>
            long after him, and was buried at Arethusa in Macedonia. <lb/>
            It was considered a great proof and token of his fame by <lb/>
            the admirers of Euripides, that this should happen to him <lb/>
            after his death which happened before to the especial <lb/>
            favourite of Heaven. Some say that Lykurgus died at <lb/>
            Kirrha, but Apollothemis says that he was taken to Elis <lb/>
            and died there, and Timæus and Aristoxenus say that he <lb/>
            ended his days in Crete. Aristoxenus even says that the <lb/>
            Cretans show his tomb in what is called the Strangers' <lb/>
            Road in Pergamia. He is said to have left one son, <lb/>
            Antiorus, who died childless, and so ended the family. <lb/>
            His companions and relatives and their descendants kept <lb/>
            up the practice of meeting together for a long period; and <lb/>
            the days when they met were called Lykurgids. Aristo­ <lb/>
            krates the son of Hipparchus says that when Lykurgus <lb/>
            died in Crete, his friends burned his body and threw the <lb/>
            ashes into the sea, at his own request, as he feared that if <lb/>
            any remains of him should be brought back to Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            they would think themselves absolved from their oath, and <lb/>
            change the constitution. This is the story of Lykurgus.</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF NUMA.</title>
          </head>
          <p>L THERE is a considerable conflict of opinion about the <lb/>
            time of King Numa's reign, although several pedigrees seem <lb/>
            to be accurately traced to him. One Clodius, in a book on <lb/>
            the verification of dates, insists that all these old records <lb/>
            were destroyed during the Gaulish troubles, and that those <lb/>
            which are now extant were composed by interested persons, <lb/>
            by whose means men who had no right to such honours <lb/>
            claimed descent from the noblest families. Though Numa <lb/>
            is said to have been a friend of Pythagoras, yet some deny <lb/>
            that he had any tincture of Greek learning, arguing that <lb/>
            either he was born with a natural capacity for sound learn­ <lb/>
            ing, or that he was taught by some barbarian.* Others <lb/>
            say that Pythagoras was born much later, some five <lb/>
            generations after the times of Numa, but that Pythagoras <lb/>
            the Spartan, who won the Stadium race at Olympia on the <lb/>
            thirteenth Olympiad, wandered into Italy, and there meet­ <lb/>
            ing Numa, assisted him in the establishment of his consti­ <lb/>
            tution ; and that from this cause, the Roman constitution <lb/>
            in many points resembles the Laconian. The Olympic <lb/>
            games were instituted in the third year of Numa's reign. <lb/>
            Another story is that Numa was a Sabine by birth, and <lb/>
            the Sabines consider themselves to be of Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            origin. It is hard to reconcile the dates, especially those <lb/>
            which refer to Olympiads, the table of which is said to <lb/>
            have been made out by Hippias of Elis, on no trustworthy <lb/>
            basis. However, what things I have heard about Numa <lb/>
            that are worthy of mention I shall proceed to relate, <lb/>
            beginning from a starting-point of my own.</p>
          <p>II. Rome had been founded, and Romulus had reigned, <lb/>
            for thirty-seven years, when upon the fifth day of the <lb/>
            month of July, which day is now called nonce caprotince, he <note type="footnote"> * Thai is, by some one who vas not a Greek. </note> <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            was performing a public sacrifice outside the gates, at a <lb/>
            place called the Goat's Marsh, in the presence of the Senate <lb/>
            and most of the people. Suddenly a great commotion <lb/>
            began in the air, thick clouds covered the earth, with <lb/>
            violent gusts and showers. The people fled in terror, and <lb/>
            Romulus disappeared. His body could never be found, <lb/>
            but suspicion fell upon the patricians, and a report was <lb/>
            current among the populace that they had long been <lb/>
            jealous of his power as king, and had determined to get it <lb/>
            into their own hands. Indeed, he had dealt with them <lb/>
            very harshly and tyrannically. Fearing this suspicion, <lb/>
            they gave out that he was not dead, but had been caught <lb/>
            up into heaven; and Proclus, a man of mark, swore that <lb/>
            he saw Romulus ascend into heaven in his armour as he <lb/>
            was, and that he heard a voice ordering that he should be <lb/>
            called Quirinus. Another disturbance took place in Rome <lb/>
            about the election of the next king, because the new <lb/>
            citizens were not yet thoroughly amalgamated with the <lb/>
            old ones, the people were unquiet, and the patricians <lb/>
            suspicious of one another. Nevertheless they all determined <lb/>
            that they would have a king, but they disagreed not <lb/>
            merely about who, but of what race he should be.</p>
          <p>Romulus's original colonists thought it a monstrous thing <lb/>
            that the Sabines, because they had been admitted to a <lb/>
            share of the city and the country, should propose to rule <lb/>
            over it; while the Sabines not unreasonably urged that <lb/>
            because, after the death of Tatius, they had acquiesced in <lb/>
            Romulus reigning alone, now in their turn they ought to <lb/>
            furnish a king of their own nation. They had not, they <lb/>
            said, been adopted by a more powerful race than them­ <lb/>
            selves, but had, by their combination with the Romans, <lb/>
            greatly raised the power and renown of their city.</p>
          <p>The two races were at issue on these points. The <lb/>
            patricians, fearing that confusion might arise if the state <lb/>
            were left without a head, made one of their own number <lb/>
            every day assume the insignia of royalty, perform the <lb/>
            usual sacrifices to the gods, and transact business for six <lb/>
            hours by day, and six by night. This equal division of <lb/>
            their periods of rule was not only just for those in office, <lb/>
            but prevented any jealousy of them being felt by the <lb/>
            populace, each day and night, because they saw one who <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            had been a king become a private person. This form of <lb/>
            government the Romans call an interregnum.</p>
          <p>III. But, although they appeared to manage things so <lb/>
            smoothly, suspicions and threatenings of disturbance arose, <lb/>
            for men said that they meditated altering the form of <lb/>
            government to an oligarchy, in order to keep all political <lb/>
            power in their own hands, and would not therefore elect a <lb/>
            king. Hereupon the two factions agreed that one should <lb/>
            select a king from the ranks of the other. This, they <lb/>
            thought, would both put an end to their quarrels for the <lb/>
            present, and also ensure the candidate who should be <lb/>
            chosen being impartial, because he would be friendly to <lb/>
            the one party because it had chosen him, and to the other <lb/>
            because he belonged to it by birth. The Sabines gave the <lb/>
            Romans their choice which they would do; and they <lb/>
            decided that it would be better to choose a Sabine king <lb/>
            themselves, than to be ruled by a Roman chosen by the <lb/>
            Sabines. After deliberation amongst themselves, they <lb/>
            chose Numa Pompilius, a man who was not one of those <lb/>
            Sabines who had settled in Rome, but whose excellence <lb/>
            was so well-known to all, that the Sabines, as soon as they <lb/>
            heard his name, were even more eager for him than the <lb/>
            Romans who had chosen him. When they had informed <lb/>
            the people of their decision, they sent an embassy to <lb/>
            Numa, composed of the leading men of both parties, to beg <lb/>
            of him to come to Rome and assume the crown.</p>
          <p>Numa belonged to a celebrated Sabine city, Cures, from <lb/>
            which the united Romans and Sabines called themselves <lb/>
            Quirites. He was the son of Pomponius, an honourable <lb/>
            citizen, and was the youngest of four brothers. By a <lb/>
            miraculous coincidence he was born on the very day on <lb/>
            which Romulus founded Rome; that is, the tenth day <lb/>
            before the Calends of May. His naturally good disposition <lb/>
            had been so educated by sorrow and philosophic pursuits, <lb/>
            that he rose superior not merely to commonplace vices, but <lb/>
            even to the worship of brute force, so common among <lb/>
            barbarians, and considered true courage to consist in the <lb/>
            conquest of his own passions. Accordingly he banished <lb/>
            all luxury and extravagance from his house, and was known <lb/>
            as a trusty friend and counsellor, both by his countrymen <lb/>
            and by strangers. When at leisure, he disregarded sensual <lb/>
            enjoyments and money-getting, but devoted himself to the <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            service of the gods and to speculations about their nature <lb/>
            and power, so that he obtained great celebrity. Indeed <lb/>
            Tatius, when he was acting as joint-king with Romulus, <lb/>
            chose him for the husband of his only daughter Tatia. <lb/>
            But Numa was not elated by his marriage, and did not <lb/>
            remove to the town where his father-in-law was king, but <lb/>
            stayed where he was in Cures, among the Sabines, tending <lb/>
            his aged father; while Tatia also preferred the quiet of a <lb/>
            private citizen's life to the pomp which she might have <lb/>
            enjoyed in Rome. She is said to have died in the thirteenth <lb/>
            year after her marriage.</p>
          <p>IV. Now Numa was in the habit of leaving the city and <lb/>
            passing much of his time in the country, wandering alone <lb/>
            in the sacred groves and dwelling in desert places. Hence <lb/>
            the story first arose that it was not from any derangement <lb/>
            of intellect that he shunned human society, but because he <lb/>
            held converse with higher beings, and had been admitted <lb/>
            to marriage with the gods, and that, by passing his time <lb/>
            in converse with the nymph Egeria, who loved him, he <lb/>
            became blessed, and learned heavenly wisdom. It is evi­ <lb/>
            dent that this is the same as many ancient myths; such as <lb/>
            that told by the Phrygians about Attis, that of the Bithy­ <lb/>
            nians about Herodotus, that of the Arcadians about <lb/>
            Endymion, and many others. Yet it seems probable that <lb/>
            a god, who loves man better than bird or beast, should take <lb/>
            pleasure in conversing with those men who are remarkable <lb/>
            for goodness, and not despise nor disdain to hold com­ <lb/>
            munion with the wise and righteous. But it is hard to <lb/>
            believe that a god or deity could feel the passion of love <lb/>
            for a human form ; although the Egyptians not unreason­ <lb/>
            ably say, that a woman may be impregnated by the spirit <lb/>
            of a god, but that a man can have no material union with <lb/>
            a god. However it is very right to believe that a god <lb/>
            can feel friendship for a man, and from this may spring a <lb/>
            love which watches over him and guides him in the path <lb/>
            of virtue. There is truth in the myths of Phorbas, of <lb/>
            Hyacinthus, and of Admetus, who were all loved by <lb/>
            Apollo, as was also Hippolytus of Sicyon. It is said that <lb/>
            whenever he set sail from Sikyon to Kirrha on the opposite <lb/>
            coast, the Pythia would recite the verse,<lb/>
            “ Now goes oar dear Hippolytus to sea,” <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            as if the god knew that he was coming and rejoiced <lb/>
            at it.</p>
          <p>There is a also a legend that Pan loved Pindar and his <lb/>
            verses; and for the Muse's sake, Hesiod and Archilochus <lb/>
            were honoured after their deaths ; while Sophokles during <lb/>
            his life is said, by a legend which remains current at the <lb/>
            present day, to have become the friend of Æsculapius, and <lb/>
            on his death to have had the rites of burial supplied by <lb/>
            the care of another god.</p>
          <p>If, then, we believe the legends which are told about <lb/>
            these persons, why should we doubt that Zaleukus, Minos, <lb/>
            Zoroaster, Numa, and Lykurgus were inspired by Heaven, <lb/>
            when they governed their kingdoms and gave them laws ? <lb/>
            We may suppose that the gods, when in an earnest mood, <lb/>
            would hold converse with such men as these, the best of <lb/>
            their kind, to talk with and encourage them, just as they <lb/>
            visit the poets, if they do at all, when inclined for pleasure. <lb/>
            However, if any one thinks differently, as Bacchylides <lb/>
            says, “ The way is broad."</p>
          <p>The other view, which some take about Lykurgus and <lb/>
            Numa and such men, seems very plausible, that they, <lb/>
            having to deal with an obstinate and unmanageable <lb/>
            people when introducing great political changes, invented <lb/>
            the idea of their own divine mission as a means of safety <lb/>
            for themselves.</p>
          <p>V. It was in Numa's fortieth year that the envoys <lb/>
            came from Rome to ask him to be king. Their spokes­ <lb/>
            men were Proculus and Velesius, one of whom had very <lb/>
            nearly been elected king, for the Romulus people inclined <lb/>
            much to Proculus, and those of Tatius were equally in <lb/>
            favour of Velesius. These men made a short speech, <lb/>
            imagining that Numa would be delighted with his for­ <lb/>
            tune ; but it appears that it took much hard pleading to <lb/>
            induce a man who had lived all his life in peace to take <lb/>
            the command of a city which owed its origin and its <lb/>
            increase alike to war. He said, in the presence of his <lb/>
            father and of Marcius, one of his relations, " Every change <lb/>
            in a man's life is dangerous; and when a man is not in <lb/>
            want of anything needful, and has no cause for being <lb/>
            dissatisfied with his lot, it is sheer madness for him to <lb/>
            change his habits and way of life; for these, at any rate <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            have the advantage of security, while in the new state <lb/>
            all is uncertain. Not even uncertain are the perils of <lb/>
            royalty, judging from Romulus himself, who was sus­ <lb/>
            pected of having plotted against his partner Tatius, and <lb/>
            whose peers were suspected of having assassinated him. <lb/>
            Yet these men call Romulus the child of the gods, and <lb/>
            tell how he had a divinely sent nurse, and was preserved <lb/>
            by a miracle while yet a child; while I was born of <lb/>
            mortal parents, and brought up by people whom you all <lb/>
            know: even the points which you praise in my character <lb/>
            are far from those which make a good king, being <lb/>
            love of leisure and of unprofitable speculation, and also <lb/>
            a great fondness for peace and unwarlike matters, and for <lb/>
            men who meet together for the glory of the gods or for <lb/>
            cheerful converse with one another, and who at other <lb/>
            times plough their fields and feed their cattle at home. <lb/>
            But you Romans have very likely many wars left upon <lb/>
            your hands by Romulus, for the conduct of which the <lb/>
            state requires a vigorous warrior in the prime of life. <lb/>
            The people too, from their successes, are accustomed to <lb/>
            and eager for war, and are known to be longing for fresh <lb/>
            conquests and possessions; so that they would ridicule <lb/>
            me when I told them to honour the gods and act justly, <lb/>
            and if I tried to instil a hatred of wars and of brute force <lb/>
            into a city which wants a general more than a king."</p>
          <p>VI. As he refused the offered crown in such terms, the <lb/>
            Romans used every kind of entreaty to induce him to <lb/>
            accept it, begging him not to plunge the state again into <lb/>
            civil war, because there was no other man whom the two <lb/>
            parties would agree to receive as their king. In their <lb/>
            absence, his father and Marcius begged him not to refuse <lb/>
            so great and marvellous an offer. “ If," they said, " you <lb/>
            do not desire wealth, because of your simple life, and do <lb/>
            not care for the glory of royalty, because you derive more <lb/>
            glory from your own virtue, yet think that to be king <lb/>
            is to serve God, who gives you this office and will not <lb/>
            allow your righteousness to lie idle, useful only to your­ <lb/>
            self. Do not therefore shrink from assuming this office, <lb/>
            which gives you an opportunity to conduct the solemn <lb/>
            ceremonials of religion with due pomp, and to civilise the. <lb/>
            people and turn their hearts, which can be effected more <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            easily by a king than by any one else. This people loved <lb/>
            Tatius, though he was a foreigner, and they respect the <lb/>
            memory of Romulus as if he was a god. And who knows, <lb/>
            if the people, although victorious, may not have had <lb/>
            enough of wars, and, sated with triumphs and spoils, may <lb/>
            not be desirous of a gentle and just ruler under whom <lb/>
            they may enjoy rest and peace. If, however, they are <lb/>
            madly bent upon war, is it not better that you should <lb/>
            hold the reins, and direct their fury elsewhere, becoming <lb/>
            yourself a bond of union and friendship between the <lb/>
            Sabine nation and this powerful and flourishing city?" <lb/>
            Besides these arguments, it is said that the omens were <lb/>
            favourable, and that the people of the city, as soon as <lb/>
            they heard of the embassy, came and besought him to go <lb/>
            and become king, and thus unite and combine the two races.</p>
          <p>VII. When he had made up his mind, he sacrificed to <lb/>
            the gods, and started for Rome. The Senate and people <lb/>
            met him and showed great affection for him ; the matrons <lb/>
            also greeted him, and there were sacrifices in the temples, <lb/>
            and every one was as joyous as if he had received a king­ <lb/>
            dom instead of a king. When they came into the Forum, <lb/>
            the interrex or temporary king, Spurius Vettius, put it to <lb/>
            the vote, and all the people voted for Numa. When they <lb/>
            offered him the insignia of royalty, he bade them stop, <lb/>
            saying that he wished to have his crown confirmed to him <lb/>
            by God as well as by man. Taking the prophets and <lb/>
            priests he ascended the Capitol, which the Romans at that <lb/>
            time called the Tarpeian Hill. There the chief of the <lb/>
            prophets made him turn towards the south, covered his <lb/>
            bead, and then standing behind him with his hand laid <lb/>
            upon his head, he prayed, and looked for a sign or omen <lb/>
            sent from the gods in every quarter of the heavens. A <lb/>
            strange silence prevailed among the people in the Forum, <lb/>
            as they watched him eagerly, until a prosperous omen <lb/>
            was observed. Then Numa received the royal robes and <lb/>
            came down from the hill among the people. They re­ <lb/>
            ceived him with cheers and congratulations, as the most <lb/>
            pious of men, and as beloved of Heaven. When he be­ <lb/>
            came king, his first act was to disband the body-guard of <lb/>
            three hundred men, whom Romulus always had kept about <lb/>
            his person, who were called Celeres, that is, swift; for <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            Numa would not distrust a loyal people nor reign over <lb/>
            a disloyal one. Next he instituted a third high priest, <lb/>
            in addition to the existing priests of Jupiter and Mars, <lb/>
            whom, in honour of Romulus, he called the Flamen <lb/>
            Quirinalis. The elder priests are called Flamens from <lb/>
            the skull-caps which they wear, and the word is derived <lb/>
            from the Greek word for felt; for at that time Greek <lb/>
            words were mingled with Latin ones more than now. <lb/>
            For instance, the lœna worn by the priests is said by <lb/>
            Juba to be the Greek chlaina, and the boy, whose parents <lb/>
            must be both alive, who is servant to the priest of Jupiter, <lb/>
            is called Camillus, just as the Greeks sometimes call <lb/>
            Hermes (Mercury) Cadmilus, from his being the servant <lb/>
            of the gods.</p>
          <p>VIII. Numa, after confirming his popularity by these <lb/>
            measures, proceeded at once to attempt to convert the city <lb/>
            from the practice of war and the strong hand, to that of <lb/>
            right and justice, just as a man tries to soften and mould <lb/>
            a mass of iron. The city at that time was indeed what <lb/>
            Plato calls inflamed and angry," for it owed its very <lb/>
            existence to the reckless daring by which it had thrust <lb/>
            aside the most warlike races of the country, and had <lb/>
            recruited its strength by many campaigns and ceaseless <lb/>
            war, and, as carpentry becomes more fixed in its place by <lb/>
            blows, so the city seemed to gain fresh power from its <lb/>
            dangers. Thinking that it would be a very difficult task <lb/>
            to change the habits of this excited and savage people, <lb/>
            and to teach them the arts of peace, he looked to the gods <lb/>
            for help, and by sacrifices, processions, and choral dances, <lb/>
            which he himself organised and arranged, he awed, in­ <lb/>
            terested, and softened the manners of the Romans, artfully <lb/>
            beguiling them out of their warlike ferocity. Sometimes <lb/>
            he spoke of supernatural terrors, evil omens, and unpro­ <lb/>
            pitious voices, so as to influence them by means of super­ <lb/>
            stition. These measures proved his wisdom, and showed <lb/>
            him a true disciple of Pythagoras, for the worship of the <lb/>
            gods was an important part of his state policy, as it is of <lb/>
            Pythagoras's system of philosophy. His love of outward <lb/>
            show and stratagem was also said to be derived from <lb/>
            Pythagoras, for as the latter tamed an eagle and made it <lb/>
            alight upon him, and when walking through the crowd <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            at Olympia showed his golden thigh, and did all the <lb/>
            other surprising devices which made Timon of Phlius <lb/>
            write the epigram­ <lb/>
            " Pythagoras by magic arts, <lb/>
            And mystic talk deludes men's hearts,” <lb/>
            so did Numa invent the story of his amour with a wood­ <lb/>
            nymph and his secret converse with her, and of his en­ <lb/>
            joying the society of the Muses. He referred most of his <lb/>
            prophetic utterances to the Muses, and taught the Romans <lb/>
            to worship one of them especially, whom he called Tacita, <lb/>
            which means silent or dumb. This seems to have been <lb/>
            done in imitation of Pythagoras, who especially revered <lb/>
            silence. His legislation about images was also connected <lb/>
            with the Pythagorean doctrine, which says that first <lb/>
            principles cannot be touched or seen, but are invisible <lb/>
            spiritual essences; for Numa forbade the Romans to wor­ <lb/>
            ship any likenesses of men or of beasts. Among them <lb/>
            there was no image of a god, either carved or moulded, in <lb/>
            the early times. For a hundred and seventy years they <lb/>
            built temples, and placed shrines in them, but made no <lb/>
            image of any living thing, considering that it was wrong <lb/>
            to make the worse like the better, and that God cannot <lb/>
            be comprehended otherwise than by thought. Their <lb/>
            sacrifices also were connected with the Pythagorean <lb/>
            doctrine; they were for the most part bloodless, and <lb/>
            performed with flour, libations of wine, and all the com­ <lb/>
            monest things. But besides these, there are other distinct <lb/>
            proofs of the connection of these two men with one <lb/>
            another. One of these is that the Romans enrolled <lb/>
            Pythagoras as a citizen, as we are told by Epicharmus <lb/>
            the comic poet, in a letter which he wrote to Antenor. <lb/>
            He was a man who lived in old times and underwent the <lb/>
            Pythagorean training. Another proof is that of his four <lb/>
            sons, King Numa named one Mamercus after the son of <lb/>
            Pythagoras; from whom sprung the ancient patrician <lb/>
            house of the Æmilii. This name was originally given <lb/>
            him in sport by the king, who used to call him aimulos or <lb/>
            wily. I myself have heard many Romans narrate that an <lb/>
            oracle once bade the Romans establish the wisest and <lb/>
            the bravest of the Greeks in their own city, and that in <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            consequence of it they set up two brazen statues in the <lb/>
            Forum, one of Alkibiades and one of Pythagoras. But <lb/>
            all this can be so easily disputed that it is not worth <lb/>
            while to pursue it farther or to put any trust in it.</p>
          <p>IX. To Numa also is referred the institution of the <lb/>
            Pontifices, or high priests; and he himself is said to have <lb/>
            been one of the first. The Pontifices are so called, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to some authorities, because they worship the <lb/>
            gods, who are powerful and almighty; for powerful in <lb/>
            Latin is potens. Others say that it refers to an exception <lb/>
            made in favour of possibilities, meaning that the legislator <lb/>
            ordered the priests to perform what services lay in their <lb/>
            power, and did not deny that there are some which they <lb/>
            cannot. But the most usually received and most absurd <lb/>
            derivation is that the word means nothing more than <lb/>
            bridge builders, and that they were so named from the <lb/>
            sacrifices which are offered upon the sacred bridge, which <lb/>
            are of great sanctity and antiquity. The Latins call a <lb/>
            bridge pontem. This bridge is intrusted to the care of the <lb/>
            priests, like any other immovable holy relic; for the <lb/>
            Romans think that the removal of the wooden bridge <lb/>
            would call down the wrath of Heaven. It is said to be <lb/>
            entirely composed of wood, in accordance with some <lb/>
            oracle, without any iron whatever.</p>
          <p>The stone bridge was built many years afterwards, <lb/>
            when AEmilius was Quaestor. However, it is said that <lb/>
            the wooden bridge itself does not date from the time of <lb/>
            Numa, but that it was finished by Marcius, the grandson <lb/>
            of Numa, when he was king.</p>
          <p>The chief priest, or Pontifex Maximus, is an interpreter <lb/>
            and prophet or rather expounder of the will of Heaven. <lb/>
            He not only sees that the public sacrifices are properly <lb/>
            conducted, but even watches those who offer private <lb/>
            sacrifices, opposes all departure from established custom, <lb/>
            and points out to each man how to honour the gods and <lb/>
            how to pray to them. He also presides over the holy <lb/>
            maidens called vestals.</p>
          <p>The consecration of the vestal virgins, and the worship <lb/>
            and watching of the eternal flame by them, are entirely <lb/>
            attributed to Numa, and explained either by the pure <lb/>
            and uncorruptible essence of fire being intrusted to the <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            keeping of those who are stainless and undefiled, or by <lb/>
            that which is barren and without fruit being associated <lb/>
            with maidens.</p>
          <p>Indeed, in Greece, wherever an eternal fire is kept up, <lb/>
            as at Delphi and Athens, it is not maidens, but widows, <lb/>
            past the age to wed, that tend it. When any of these <lb/>
            fires chance to go out, as, for instance, the sacred lamp <lb/>
            went out at Athens when Aristion was despot, and the fire <lb/>
            went out at Delphi when the temple was burned by the <lb/>
            Persians, and at Rome in the revolutions during the time <lb/>
            of the wars with King Mithridates the fire, and even the <lb/>
            altar upon which it burned, was swept away; then they <lb/>
            say that it must not be lighted from another fire, but that <lb/>
            an entirely new fire must be made, lighted by a pure and <lb/>
            undefiled ray from the sun. They usually light it with <lb/>
            mirrors made by hollowing the surface of an isosceles right­ <lb/>
            angled triangle, which conducts all the rays of light into <lb/>
            one point. Now when it is placed opposite to the sun, so <lb/>
            that all the rays coming from all quarters are collected <lb/>
            together into that point, the ray thus formed passes <lb/>
            through the thin air, and at once lights the dryest and <lb/>
            lightest of the objects againt which it strikes, for that ray <lb/>
            has the strength and force of fire itself.</p>
          <p>Some say that the only duty of the vestal virgins is <lb/>
            to watch that eternal fire, but others say they perform <lb/>
            certain secret rites, about which we have written as much <lb/>
            as it is lawful to divulge, in the Life of Camillus.</p>
          <p>X. The first maidens who were consecrated by Numa <lb/>
            were named Gegania and Yerenia; and afterwards <lb/>
            Canuleia and Tarpeia were added. Servius subsequently <lb/>
            added two more to their number, which has remained six <lb/>
            ever since his reign. Numa ordained that the maidens <lb/>
            should observe celibacy for thirty years, during the first <lb/>
            ten years of which they were to learn their duties, during <lb/>
            the next perform them, and during the last to teach <lb/>
            others. After this period any of them who wished might <lb/>
            marry and cease to be priestesses; but it is said that very <lb/>
            few availed themselves of this privilege, and that those <lb/>
            few were not happy, but, by their regrets and sorrow for <lb/>
            the life they had left, made the others scruple to leave it, <lb/>
            and prefer so remain virgins till their death. They had <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            great privileges, such as that of disposing of their property <lb/>
            by will when their fathers were still alive, like women who <lb/>
            have borne three children. When they walk abroad they <lb/>
            are escorted by lictors with the fasces; and if they happen <lb/>
            to meet any criminal who is being taken to execution, he <lb/>
            is not put to death; but the vestal must swear that she <lb/>
            met him accidentally, and not on purpose. When they use <lb/>
            a litter, no one may pass under it on pain of death. The <lb/>
            vestals are corrected by stripes for any faults which they <lb/>
            commit, sometimes by the Pontifex Maximus, who flogs <lb/>
            the culprit without her clothes, but with a curtain drawn <lb/>
            before her. She that breaks her vow of celibacy is buried <lb/>
            alive at the Colline Gate, at which there is a mound of <lb/>
            earth which stretches some way inside the city wall. In <lb/>
            it they construct an underground chamber, of small size, <lb/>
            which is entered from above. In it is a bed with bedding, <lb/>
            and a lamp burning; and also some small means of sup­ <lb/>
            porting life, such as bread, a little water in a vessel, <lb/>
            milk, and oil, as though they wished to avoid the pollu­ <lb/>
            tion of one who had been consecrated with such holy <lb/>
            ceremonies dying of hunger. The guilty one is placed <lb/>
            in a litter, covered in, and gagged with thongs so that she <lb/>
            cannot utter a sound. Then they carry her through the <lb/>
            Forum. All make way in silence, and accompany her <lb/>
            passage with downcast looks, without speaking. There <lb/>
            is no more fearful sight than this, nor any day when the <lb/>
            city is plunged into deeper mourning. When the litter <lb/>
            reaches the appointed spot, the servants loose her bonds, <lb/>
            and the chief priest, after private prayer and lifting his <lb/>
            hands to Heaven before his dreadful duty, leads her out, <lb/>
            closely veiled, places her upon a ladder which leads down <lb/>
            into the subterranean chamber. After this he turns away <lb/>
            with the other priests; the ladder is drawn up after she <lb/>
            has descended, and the site of the chamber is obliterated <lb/>
            by masses of earth which are piled upon it, so that the <lb/>
            place looks like any other part of the mound. Thus are <lb/>
            the vestals punished who lose their chastity.</p>
          <p>XI. Numa is said to have built the Temple of Veda, <lb/>
            which was to contain the sacred fire, in a circular form, <lb/>
            imitating thereby not the shape of the earth, but that of <lb/>
            the entire universe, in the midst of which the Pythagoreans <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            place the element of fire, which they call Vesta and the <lb/>
            Unit. The earth they say is not motionless, and not in <lb/>
            the centre of its orbit, but revolves round the central fire, <lb/>
            occupying by no means the first or the most honourable <lb/>
            place in the system of the universe. These ideas are said <lb/>
            to have been entertained by Plato also in his old age; for <lb/>
            he too thought that the earth was in a subordinate <lb/>
            position, and that the centre of the universe was occupied <lb/>
            by some nobler body.</p>
          <p>XII. The Pontifices also explain, to those who inquire <lb/>
            of them, the proper ceremonies at funerals. For Numa <lb/>
            taught them not to think that there was any pollution in <lb/>
            death, but that we must pay due honours to the gods <lb/>
            below, because they will receive all that is noblest on <lb/>
            earth. Especially he taught them to honour the goddess <lb/>
            Libitina, the goddess who presides over funeral rites, <lb/>
            whether she be Proserpine, or rather Venus, as the most <lb/>
            learned Romans imagine, not unnaturally referring our <lb/>
            birth and our death to the same divinity.</p>
          <p>He also defined the periods of mourning, according to <lb/>
            the age of the deceased. He allowed none for a child <lb/>
            under three years of age, and for one older the mourning <lb/>
            was only to last as many months as he lived years, pro­ <lb/>
            vided those were not more than ten. The longest mourn­ <lb/>
            ing was not to continue above ten months, after which <lb/>
            space widows were permitted to marry again; but she that <lb/>
            took another husband before that term was out was obliged <lb/>
            by his decree to sacrifice a cow with calf.</p>
          <p>Of Numa's many other institutions I shall only mention <lb/>
            two, that of the Salii and of the Feciales, which especially <lb/>
            show his love of justice. The Feciales are, as it were, <lb/>
            guardians of peace, and in my opinion obtain their name <lb/>
            from their office; for they were to act as mediators, and <lb/>
            not to permit an appeal to arms before all hope of obtain­ <lb/>
            ing justice by fair means had been lost. The Greeks call <lb/>
            it peace when two states settle their differences by negotia­ <lb/>
            tion and not by arms ; and the Roman Feciales frequently <lb/>
            went to states that had done wrong and begged them to <lb/>
            think better of what they had done. If they rejected their <lb/>
            offers, then the Feciales called the gods to witness, invoked <lb/>
            dreadful curses upon themselves and their country, if they <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            were about to fight in an unjust cause, and so declared <lb/>
            war. Against the will of the Feciales, or without their <lb/>
            approval, no Roman, whether king or common soldier, was <lb/>
            allowed to take up arms, but the general was obliged first <lb/>
            to have it certified to him by the Feciales that the right <lb/>
            was on his side, and then to take his measures for a <lb/>
            campaign. It is said that the great disaster with the <lb/>
            Gauls befell the city in consequence of this ceremony <lb/>
            having been neglected. The barbarians were besieging <lb/>
            Clusium ; Fabius Ambustus was sent as an ambassador <lb/>
            to their camp to make terms on behalf of the besieged. <lb/>
            His proposals met with a harsh reply, and he, thinking <lb/>
            that his mission- was at an end, had the audacity to appear <lb/>
            before the ranks of the men of Clusium in arms, and to <lb/>
            challenge the bravest of the barbarians to single combat. <lb/>
            He won the fight, slew his opponent and stripped his <lb/>
            body; but the Gauls recognised him, and sent a herald to <lb/>
            Rome, complaining that Fabius had broken faith and not <lb/>
            kept his word, and had waged war against them without <lb/>
            its being previously declared. Hereupon the Feciales <lb/>
            urged the Senate to deliver the man up to the Gauls, but <lb/>
            he appealed to the people, and by their favour escaped his <lb/>
            just doom. Soon after the Gauls came and sacked Rome, <lb/>
            except the Capitol. But this is treated of more at length <lb/>
            in the ‘ Life of Camillus.'</p>
          <p>XIII. The priests called Salii are said to owe their origin <lb/>
            to the following circumstances: In the eighth year of <lb/>
            Numa's reign an epidemic raged throughout Italy, and <lb/>
            afflicted the city of Rome. Now amidst the general distress <lb/>
            it is related that a brazen shield fell from heaven into the <lb/>
            hands of Numa. Upon this the king made an inspired <lb/>
            speech, which he had learned from Egeria and the Muses. <lb/>
            The shield, he said, came for the salvation of the city, and <lb/>
            they must guard it, and make eleven more like it, so that <lb/>
            no thief could steal the one that fell from heaven, because <lb/>
            he could not tell which it was. Moreover the place and <lb/>
            the meadows round about it, where he was wont to con­ <lb/>
            verse with the Muses, must be consecrated to them, and <lb/>
            the well by which it was watered must be pointed out as <lb/>
            holy water to the vestal virgins, that they might daily <lb/>
            take some thence to purify and sprinkle their temple. <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            The truth of this is said to have been proved by the im­ <lb/>
            mediate cessation of the plague. He bade workmen <lb/>
            compete in imitating the shield, and, when all others <lb/>
            refused to attempt it, Veturius Mamurius, one of the best <lb/>
            workmen of the time, produced so admirable an imitation, <lb/>
            and made all the shields so exactly alike, that even Numa <lb/>
            himself could not tell which was the original. He next <lb/>
            appointed the Salii to guard and keep them. These priests <lb/>
            were called Salii, not, as some say, after a man of Samothrace <lb/>
            or of Mantinea named Salius, who first taught the art of <lb/>
            dancing under arms, but rather from the springing dance <lb/>
            itself, which they dance through the city when they carry <lb/>
            out the shields in the month of March, dressed in scarlet <lb/>
            tunics, girt with brazen girdles, with brazen helmets on <lb/>
            their heads and little daggers with which they strike the <lb/>
            shields. The rest of their dance is done with their feet; <lb/>
            they move gracefully, whirling round, swiftly and airily <lb/>
            counter-changing their positions with light and vigorous <lb/>
            motions according to rhythm and measure. The shields are <lb/>
            called ancilia, because of their shape; for they are not <lb/>
            round, nor with a perfect circumference, but are cut out <lb/>
            of a wavy line, and curl in at the thickest part towards <lb/>
            each other; or they may be called ancilia after the name <lb/>
            of the elbow, anlcon, on which they are carried; at least so <lb/>
            Juba conjectures in his endeavours to find a Greek deriva <lb/>
            tion for the word. The name may be connected with the <lb/>
            fall of the shield from above (anekathen), or with the heal­ <lb/>
            ing (akesis) of the plague, and the cessation of that terrible <lb/>
            calamity, if we must refer the word to a Greek root.</p>
          <p>It is related that, to reward Mamurius for his workman­ <lb/>
            ship, his name is mentioned in the song which the Salii <lb/>
            sing while they dance their Pyrrhic dance; others, how­ <lb/>
            ever, say that it is not Veturium Mamurium that they say, <lb/>
            but Veterem Memoriam, which means ancient memory.</p>
          <p>XIV. After he had arranged all religious ceremonies, he <lb/>
            built, near the temple of Vesta, the Regia, as a kind of <lb/>
            royal palace; and there he spent most of his time, engaged <lb/>
            in religious duties, instructing the priests, or awaiting <lb/>
            some divine colloquy. He had also another house on the <lb/>
            hill of Quirinus, the site of which is even now pointed out.</p>
          <p>In all religious processions through the city the heralds <note type="footnote"> A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="114"/>
            went first to bid the people cease their work, and attend <lb/>
            to the ceremony ; for just as the Pythagoreans are said to <lb/>
            forbid the worship of the gods in a cursory manner, and to <lb/>
            insist that men shall set out from their homes with this <lb/>
            purpose and none other in their minds, so Numa thought <lb/>
            it wrong that the citizens should see or hear any religious <lb/>
            ceremony in a careless, half-hearted manner, and made them <lb/>
            cease from all worldly cares and attend with all their <lb/>
            hearts to the most important of all duties, religion ; so he <lb/>
            cleared the streets of all the hammering, and cries, and <lb/>
            noises which attend the practice of ordinary trades and <lb/>
            handicrafts, before any holy ceremony. Some trace of <lb/>
            this custom still survives in the practice of crying out <lb/>
            Hoc age when the consul is taking the auspices or making <lb/>
            a sacrifice. These words mean " Do this thing," and are <lb/>
            used to make the bystanders orderly and attentive. Many <lb/>
            of his other precepts are like those of the Pythagoreans; <lb/>
            for just as they forbid men to sit upon a quart measure, or <lb/>
            to stir the fire with a sword, or to turn back when they <lb/>
            set out upon a journey, and bid them sacrifice an odd <lb/>
            number to the gods above, and an even one to those below, <lb/>
            all of which things had a mystical meaning, which was <lb/>
            hidden from the common mass of mankind, so also some of <lb/>
            Numa's rites can only be explained by reference to some <lb/>
            secret legend, such as his forbidding men to make a libation <lb/>
            to the gods with wine made from an unpruned vine, and <lb/>
            his ordering that no sacrifice should be made without flour, <lb/>
            and that men should turn round while worshipping and <lb/>
            sit after they had worshipped. The first two of these <lb/>
            seem to point to cultivation of the fruits of the earth, as a <lb/>
            part of righteousness; the turning round of the worship­ <lb/>
            pers is said to be in imitation of the revolution of the globe, <lb/>
            but it seems more probable that, as all temples look <lb/>
            towards the east, the worshipper who enters with his back <lb/>
            to the sun turns round towards this god also, and begs of <lb/>
            them both, as he makes his circuit, to fulfil his prayer. <lb/>
            Unless indeed there is an allusion to the symbolical wheel <lb/>
            of the Egyptians, and the change of posture means that <lb/>
            nothing human is constant, and that, however God may <lb/>
            turn about our lives, it is our duty to be content. The <lb/>
            act of sitting after prayer was said to portend that such <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            as were good would obtain a solid and lasting fulfilment of <lb/>
            their prayers. Or again, this attitude of rest marks the <lb/>
            division between different periods of prayer; so that after <lb/>
            the end of one prayer they seat themselves in the presence <lb/>
            of the gods, in order that under their auspices they may <lb/>
            begin the next. This fully agrees with what has been <lb/>
            said above, and shows that the lawgiver intended to ac­ <lb/>
            custom his countrymen not to offer their prayers in a <lb/>
            hurry, or in the intervals of doing something else, but when <lb/>
            they were at leisure and not pressed for time.</p>
          <p>XV. By this religious training the city became so easily <lb/>
            managed by Numa, and so impressed by his power, as to <lb/>
            believe stories of the wildest character about him, and to <lb/>
            think nothing incredible or impossible if he wished to do <lb/>
            it. For instance, it is related that once he invited many <lb/>
            of the citizens to dine with him, and placed before them <lb/>
            common vessels and poor fare; but, as they were about to <lb/>
            begin dinner, he suddenly said that his familiar goddess <lb/>
            was about to visit him, and at once displayed abundance <lb/>
            of golden cups and tables covered with costly delicacies. <lb/>
            The strangest story of all is that of his conversation with <lb/>
            Jupiter. The legend runs that Mount Aventine was not <lb/>
            at this time enclosed within the city, but was full of <lb/>
            fountains and shady glens, and haunted by two divinities, <lb/>
            Picus and Faunus, who may be compared to Satyrs or to <lb/>
            Pan, and who, in knowledge of herbs and magic, seem <lb/>
            equal to what the Greeks call the Daktyli of Mount Ida. <lb/>
            These creatures roamed about Italy playing their tricks, <lb/>
            but Numa caught them by filling the spring at which they <lb/>
            drank with wine and honey. They turned into all kinds <lb/>
            of shapes, and assumed strange and terrible forms, but <lb/>
            when they found that they were unable to escape, they <lb/>
            told Numa much of the future, and showed him how to <lb/>
            make a charm against thunder-bolts, which is used to this <lb/>
            day, and is made of onions and hair and sprats. Some say <lb/>
            that it was not these deities who told him the charm, but <lb/>
            that they by magic arts brought down Jupiter from <lb/>
            heaven, and he, in a rage, ordered Numa to make the <lb/>
            charm of “ Heads ” ; and when Numa added, “ Of onions," <lb/>
            he said “ Of men’s”—“ Hair," said Numa, again taking away <lb/>
            the terrible part of thee imprecation. When then Jupiter <note type="footnote"> i 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            said " With living "—" Sprats," said Numa, answering as <lb/>
            Egeria had taught him. The god went away appeased, <lb/>
            and the place was in consequence called Ilicius. This was <lb/>
            how the charm was discovered.</p>
          <p>These ridiculous legends show the way in which the <lb/>
            people had become accustomed to regard the gods. <lb/>
            Indeed Numa is said to have placed all his hopes in <lb/>
            religion, to such an extent that even when a message was <lb/>
            brought him, saying, “ The enemy are approaching," he <lb/>
            smiled and said, " And I am sacrificing."</p>
          <p>XVI. The first temples that he founded are said to have <lb/>
            been those of Fides or Faith, and Terminus. Fides is said <lb/>
            to have revealed to the Romans the greatest of all oaths, <lb/>
            which they even now make use of; while Terminus is the <lb/>
            god of boundaries, to whom they sacrifice publicly, and <lb/>
            also privately at the divisions of men's estates; at the <lb/>
            present time with living victims, but in old days this <lb/>
            was a bloodless sacrifice, for Numa argued that the god <lb/>
            of boundaries must be a lover of peace, and a witness of <lb/>
            righteousness, and therefore averse to bloodshed.</p>
          <p>Indeed Numa was the first king who defined the <lb/>
            boundaries of the country, since Romulus was unwilling, <lb/>
            by measuring what was really his own, to show how much <lb/>
            he had taken from other states : for boundaries, if preserved, <lb/>
            are barriers against violence ; if disregarded, they become <lb/>
            standing proofs of lawless injustice. The city had origi­ <lb/>
            nally but a small territory of its own, and Romulus gained <lb/>
            the greater part of its possessions by the sword. All this <lb/>
            Numa distributed among the needy citizens, thereby re­ <lb/>
            moving the want which urged them to deeds of violence, <lb/>
            and, by turning the people's thoughts to husbandry, he made <lb/>
            them grow more civilised as their land grew more cultivated. <lb/>
            No profession makes men such passionate lovers of peace as <lb/>
            that of a man who farms his own land; for he retains <lb/>
            enough of the warlike spirit to fight fiercely in defence <lb/>
            of his own property, but has lost all desire to despoil and <lb/>
            wrong his neighbours. It was for this reason that Numa <lb/>
            encouraged agriculture among the Romans, as a spell to <lb/>
            charm away war, and loved the art more because of its <lb/>
            influence on men's minds than because of the wealth <lb/>
            which it produced. He divided the whole country into <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            districts, which he called pagi, and appointed a head man <lb/>
            for each, and a patrol to guard it. And sometimes he <lb/>
            himself would inspect them, and, forming an opinion of <lb/>
            each man's character from the condition of his farm, would <lb/>
            raise some to honours and offices of trust, and blaming <lb/>
            others for their remissness, would lead them to do better <lb/>
            in future.</p>
          <p>XVII. Of his other political measures, that which is most <lb/>
            admired is his division of the populace according to their <lb/>
            trades. For whereas the city, as has been said, originally <lb/>
            consisted of two races, which stood aloof one from the <lb/>
            other and would not combine into one, which led to end­ <lb/>
            less quarrels and rivalries, Numa, reflecting that substances <lb/>
            which are hard and difficult to combine together, can <lb/>
            nevertheless be mixed and formed into one mass if they <lb/>
            are broken up into small pieces, because then they more <lb/>
            easily fit into each other, determined to divide the whole <lb/>
            mass of the people of Rome into many classes, and thus, <lb/>
            by creating numerous petty rivalries, to obliterate their <lb/>
            original and greatest cause of variance.</p>
          <p>His division was according to their trades, and consisted <lb/>
            of the musicians, the goldsmiths, the builders, the dyers, <lb/>
            the shoemakers, the carriers, the coppersmiths, and the <lb/>
            potters. All the other trades he united into one guild. He <lb/>
            assigned to each trade its special privileges, common to <lb/>
            all the members, and arranged that each should have its <lb/>
            own times of meeting, and worship its own special patron <lb/>
            god, and by this means he did away with that habit, <lb/>
            which hitherto had prevailed among the citizens, of some <lb/>
            calling themselves Sabines, and some Romans; one boast­ <lb/>
            ing that they were Tatius's men, and other Romulus's. <lb/>
            So this division produced a complete fusion and unity. <lb/>
            Moreover he has been much praised for another of his <lb/>
            measures, that, namely, of correcting the old law which <lb/>
            allows fathers to sell their sons for slaves. He abolished <lb/>
            this power in the case of married men, who had married <lb/>
            with their father's consent; for he thought it a monstrous <lb/>
            injustice that a woman, who had married a free man, <lb/>
            should be compelled to be the wife of a slave.</p>
          <p>XVIII. He also dealt with astronomical matters, not <lb/>
            with perfect accuracy, and yet not altogether without <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            knowledge. During the reign of Romulus the months <lb/>
            had been in a state of great disorder, some not containing <lb/>
            twenty days, some five-and-thirty, and some even more, <lb/>
            because the Romans could not reconcile the discrepancies <lb/>
            which arise from reckoning by the sun and the moon, <lb/>
            and only insisted upon one thing, that the year should <lb/>
            consist of three hundred and sixty days.</p>
          <p>Numa reckoned the variation to consist of eleven days, <lb/>
            as the lunar year contains three hundred and fifty-four <lb/>
            days, and the solar year three hundred and sixty-five. He <lb/>
            doubled these eleven days and introduced them every other <lb/>
            year, after February, as an intercalary month, twenty­ <lb/>
            two days in duration, which was called by the Romans <lb/>
            Mercedinus. This was a remedy for the irregularities of <lb/>
            the calendar which itself required more extensive remedies.</p>
          <p>He also altered the order of the months, putting March, <lb/>
            which used to be the first month, third, and making <lb/>
            January the first, which in the time of Romulus had been <lb/>
            the eleventh, and February the second, which then had <lb/>
            been the twelfth. There are many writers who say that <lb/>
            these months, January and February, were added to the <lb/>
            calendar by Numa, and that originally there had only <lb/>
            been ten months in the year, just as some barbarians have <lb/>
            three, and in Greece the Arcadians have four, and the <lb/>
            Acarnanians six. The Egyptians originally had but one <lb/>
            month in their year, and afterwards are said to have <lb/>
            divided it into four months ; wherefore, though they live <lb/>
            in the newest of all countries, they appear to be the most <lb/>
            ancient of all nations, and in their genealogies reckon an <lb/>
            incredible number of years, because they count their <lb/>
            months as years.</p>
          <p>XIX. One proof that the Romans used to reckon ten <lb/>
            months and not twelve in the year is the name of the <lb/>
            last month; for up to the present day it is called December, <lb/>
            the tenth, and the order of the months shows that March <lb/>
            was the first, for the fifth month from it they called <lb/>
            Quintilis, the fifth; and the sixth month Sextilis, and so <lb/>
            on for the others, although, by their putting January and <lb/>
            February before March, it resulted that the month which <lb/>
            they number fifth is really seventh in order. Moreover, <lb/>
            there is a legend that the month of March, being the first. <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            was dedicated by Romulus to Mars, and the second, April, <lb/>
            to Aphrodite (Venus); in which month they sacrifice to <lb/>
            this goddess, and the women bathe on the first day of it <lb/>
            crowned with myrtle. Some, however, say that April <lb/>
            is not named after Aphrodite, because the word April does <lb/>
            not contain the letter A, and that it comes from the Latin <lb/>
            word aperio, and means the month in which the spring­ <lb/>
            time opens the buds of plants; for that is what the word <lb/>
            signifies. Of the following months, May is named after <lb/>
            Maia, the mother of Hermes or Mercury, for it is dedicated <lb/>
            to her, and Juno from Juno. Some say that these names <lb/>
            signify old age and youth, for old men are called by the <lb/>
            Latins majores, and young men juniores. The remaining <lb/>
            months they named, from the order in which they came, <lb/>
            the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth: Quintilis, <lb/>
            Sextilis, September, October, November, December. Then <lb/>
            Quintilis was called Julius after Julius Cæsar, who con­ <lb/>
            quered Pompeius ; and Sextilis was called Augustus, after <lb/>
            the second of the Roman Emperors. The next two months <lb/>
            Domitian altered to his own titles, but not for any long <lb/>
            time, as after his death they resumed their old names of <lb/>
            September and October. The last two alone have pre­ <lb/>
            served their original names without change. Of the <lb/>
            months, added or altered by Numa, Februarius means the <lb/>
            month of purification, for that is as nearly as possible the <lb/>
            meaning of the word, and during it they sacrifice to <lb/>
            the dead, and hold the festival of the Lupercalia, which <lb/>
            resembles a ceremony of purification. The first month, <lb/>
            Januarius, is named after Janus. My opinion is, that <lb/>
            Numa moved the month named after Mars from its prece­ <lb/>
            dence, wishing the art of good government to be honoured <lb/>
            before that of war. For Janus in very ancient times was <lb/>
            either a deity or a king, who established a social polity, <lb/>
            and made men cease from a savage life like that of wild <lb/>
            beasts. And for this reason his statues are made with <lb/>
            a double face, because he turned men'a way of life from <lb/>
            one form to another.</p>
          <p>XX. There is a temple to him in Rome, which has two <lb/>
            doors, and which they call the gate of war. It is the <lb/>
            custom to open the temple in time of war, and to close it <lb/>
            during peace. This scarcely ever took place, as the empire <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            was almost always at war with some state, being by its <lb/>
            very greatness continually brought into collision with <lb/>
            the neighbouring tribes. Only in the time of Cæsar <lb/>
            Augustus, after he had conquered Antonius, it was closed; <lb/>
            and before that, during the consulship of Marcus Atilius <lb/>
            and Titus Manlius, for a short time, and then was almost <lb/>
            immediately reopened, as a new war broke out. But <lb/>
            during Numa's reign no one raw it open for a single day, <lb/>
            and it remained closed for forty-three years continuously, <lb/>
            so utterly had he made wars to cease on all sides. Not <lb/>
            only was the spirit of the Romans subdued and pacified <lb/>
            by the gentle and just character of their king, but even <lb/>
            the neighbouring cities, as if some soothing healthful air <lb/>
            was breathed over them from Rome, altered their habits <lb/>
            and longed to live quiet and well-governed, cultivating <lb/>
            the earth, bringing up their families in peace, and wor­ <lb/>
            shipping the gods. And gay festivals and entertainments, <lb/>
            during which the people of the various states fearlessly <lb/>
            mixed with one another, prevailed throughout Italy, for <lb/>
            Numa's knowledge of all that was good and noble was <lb/>
            shed abroad like water from a fountain, and the atmo­ <lb/>
            sphere of holy calm by which he was surrounded spread <lb/>
            over all men. The very poets when they wrote of that <lb/>
            peaceful time were unable to find adequate expressions for <lb/>
            it, as one writes­ <lb/>
            “ Across the shields are cobwebs laid, <lb/>
            Rust eats the lance and keen edged blade; <lb/>
            No more we hear the trumpets bray, <lb/>
            And from our eyes no more is slumber chased away." <lb/>
            No war, revolution, or political disturbance of any kind <lb/>
            is recorded during Numa's reign, neither was there any <lb/>
            envy or hatred of him or any attempt by others to obtain <lb/>
            the crown; but either fear of the gods who visibly pro­ <lb/>
            tected hint, or reverence for his virtues, or the special <lb/>
            grace of Heaven, made men's lives innocent and untainted <lb/>
            with evil, and formed a striking proof of the truth of <lb/>
            what Plato said many years afterwards, that the only <lb/>
            escape from misery for men is when by Divine Providence <lb/>
            philosophy is combined with royal power, and used to <lb/>
            exalt virtue over vice. Blessed indeed is the truly wise <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            man, and blessed are they who hear the words of his <lb/>
            mouth. Indeed his people require no restraints or punish­ <lb/>
            ments, but seeing a plain example of virtue in the life of <lb/>
            their chief, they themselves of their own accord reform <lb/>
            their lives, and model them upon that gentle and blessed <lb/>
            rule of love and just dealing one with another which it <lb/>
            is the noblest work of politicians to establish. He is most <lb/>
            truly a king who can teach such lessons as these to his <lb/>
            subjects, and Numa beyond all others seems to have clearly <lb/>
            discerned this truth.</p>
          <p>XXI. Historians differ in their accounts of his wives <lb/>
            and children. Some say that he married Tatia alone, and <lb/>
            was the father of one daughter only, named Pompilia; <lb/>
            but others, besides her, assign to him four sons, named <lb/>
            Pompo, Pinus, Calpus, and Mamercus, from whom de­ <lb/>
            scended the four noble families of the Pomponii, Pinarii, <lb/>
            Calphurnii, and Mamerci, which for this reason took the <lb/>
            title of Rex, that is, king. Others again say that these <lb/>
            pedigrees were invented to flatter these families, and state <lb/>
            that the Pompilian family descends not from Tatia, but <lb/>
            from Lucretia, whom he married after he became king. <lb/>
            All, however, agree that Pompilia married Marcius, the <lb/>
            son of that Marcius who encouraged Numa to accept the <lb/>
            crown. This man accompanied Numa to Rome, was made <lb/>
            a member of the Senate, and after Numa's death laid <lb/>
            claim to the crown, but was worsted by Tullus Hostilius <lb/>
            and made away with himself. His son Marcius, who <lb/>
            married Pompilia, remained in Rome, and became the <lb/>
            father of Ancus Marcius, who was king after Tullus <lb/>
            Hostilius, and who was only five years old when Numa <lb/>
            died.</p>
          <p>We are told by Piso that Numa died, not by a sudden <lb/>
            death, but by slow decay from sheer old age, having lived <lb/>
            a little more than eighty years.</p>
          <p>XXII. He was enviable even in death, for all the <lb/>
            friendly and allied nations assembled at his funeral with <lb/>
            national offerings. The senators bore his bier, which was <lb/>
            attended by the chief priests, while the crowd of men, <lb/>
            women and children who were present, followed with <lb/>
            such weeping and wailing, that one would have thought <lb/>
            that, instead of an aged king, each man was about to bury <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            his own dearest friend, who had died in the prime of life. <lb/>
            At his own wish, it is said, the body was not burned, but <lb/>
            placed in two stone coning and buried on the Janiculum <lb/>
            Hill. One of these contained his body, and the other the <lb/>
            sacred books which he himself had written, as Greek <lb/>
            legislators write their laws upon tablets. During his <lb/>
            life he had taught the priests the contents of these books, <lb/>
            and their meaning and spirit, and ordered them to be <lb/>
            buried with his corpse, because it was right that holy <lb/>
            mysteries should be contained, not in soulless writings, <lb/>
            but in the minds of living men. For the same reason <lb/>
            they say that the Pythagoreans never reduced their maxims <lb/>
            to writing, but implanted them in the memories of worthy <lb/>
            men; and when some of their difficult processes in geo­ <lb/>
            metry were divulged to some unworthy men, they said <lb/>
            that Heaven would mark its sense of the wickedness <lb/>
            which had been committed by some great public calamity; <lb/>
            so that, as Numa's system so greatly resembled that of <lb/>
            Pythagoras, we can easily pardon those who endeavour <lb/>
            to establish a connection between them.</p>
          <p>Valerius of Antium says that twelve sacred books and <lb/>
            twelve books of Greek philosophy were placed in the <lb/>
            coffin. Four hundred years afterwards, when Publius <lb/>
            Cornelius and Marcus Bæbius were consuls, a great fall of <lb/>
            rain took place, and the torrent washed away the earth <lb/>
            and exposed the coffins. When the lids were removed, <lb/>
            one of the coffins was seen by all men to be empty, and <lb/>
            without any trace of a corpse in it; the other contained <lb/>
            the books, which were read by Petilius the prætor, who <lb/>
            reported to the Senate that in his opinion it was not right <lb/>
            that their contents should be made known to the people, <lb/>
            and they were therefore carried to the Comitium and <lb/>
            burned there.</p>
          <p>All good and just men receive most praise after their <lb/>
            death, because their unpopularity dies with them or even <lb/>
            before them ; but Numa's glory was enhanced by the <lb/>
            unhappy reigns of his successors. Of five kings who <lb/>
            succeeded him, the last was expelled and died an exile, <lb/>
            and of the other four, not one died a natural death, but <lb/>
            three were murdered by conspirators, and Tullus Hostilius, <lb/>
            who was king next after Numa, and who derided and <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            insulted his wise ordinances, especially those connected <lb/>
            with religion, as lazy and effeminate, and who urged the <lb/>
            people to take up arms, was cut down in the midst of his <lb/>
            boastings by a terrible disease, and became subject to <lb/>
            superstitious fears in no way resembling Numa's piety. <lb/>
            His subjects were led to share these terrors, more especially <lb/>
            by the manner of his death, which is said to have been by <lb/>
            the stroke of a thunderbolt.</p>

            <title type="main">COMPARISON OF NUMA WITH LYKURGUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. Now that we have gone through the lives of Numa and <lb/>
            Lykurgus, we must attempt, without being daunted <lb/>
            by difficulties, to reconcile the points in which they <lb/>
            appear to differ from each other. Much they appear to <lb/>
            have had in common, as, for example, their self-control, <lb/>
            their piety, and their political and educational ability; <lb/>
            and while the peculiar glory of Numa is his acceptance of <lb/>
            the throne, that of Lykurgus is his abdication. Numa re­ <lb/>
            ceived it without having asked for it; Lykurgus when, in <lb/>
            full possession gave it up. Numa, though a private man and <lb/>
            not even a Roman, was chosen by the Romans as their <lb/>
            king; but Lykurgus from being a king reduced himself <lb/>
            to a private station. It is honourable to obtain a crown <lb/>
            by righteousness, but it is also honourable to prefer right­ <lb/>
            eousness to a crown. Numa's virtue made him so cele­ <lb/>
            brated that he was judged worthy to be king, Lykurgus' <lb/>
            made him so great that he did not care to be king.</p>
          <p>Again, like those who tune the strings of a lyre, <lb/>
            Lykurgus drew tighter the relaxed and licentious Sparta, <lb/>
            while Numa merely slackened the highly strung and war­ <lb/>
            like Rome, so that here Lykurgus had the more difficult <lb/>
            task. He had to persuade his countrymen, not to take <lb/>
            off their armour and lay aside their swords, but to leave <lb/>
            off using gold and silver, and to lay aside costly hangings <lb/>
            and furniture; he had not to make them exchange wars <lb/>
            for sacrifices and gay festivals, but to cease from feasts <lb/>
            and drinking-parties, and work hard both in the field and <lb/>
            in the palæstra to train themselves for war.</p>
          <p>For this reason, Numa was able to effect his purpose <lb/>
            without difficulty, and without any loss of popularity and <lb/>
            respect; while Lykurgus was struck and pelted, and in <lb/>
            danger of his life, and even so could scarcely carry out his <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            reforms. Yet the genius of Numa was kindly and gentle, <lb/>
            and so softened and changed the reckless fiery Romans <lb/>
            that they became peaceful, law-abiding citizens; and if <lb/>
            we must reckon Lykurgus' treatment of the Helots as part of <lb/>
            his system, it cannot be denied that Numa was a far more <lb/>
            civilised lawgiver, seeing that he allowed even to actual <lb/>
            slaves some taste of liberty, by his institution of feasting <lb/>
            them together with their masters at the festival of Saturn.</p>
          <p>For this custom of allowing the labourers to share in <lb/>
            the harvest-feast is traced to Numa. Some say that this <lb/>
            is in remembrance of the equality which existed in the <lb/>
            time of Saturn, when there was neither master nor <lb/>
            slave, but all were kinsmen and had equal rights.</p>
          <p>II. Both evidently encouraged the spirit of inde­ <lb/>
            pendence and self-control among their people, while of <lb/>
            other virtues, Lykurgus loved bravery, and Numa loved <lb/>
            justice best; unless indeed we should say that, from the <lb/>
            very different temper and habits of the two states, they <lb/>
            required to be treated in a different manner. It was not <lb/>
            from cowardice, but because he scorned to do an injustice, <lb/>
            that Numa did not make war; while Lykurgus made his <lb/>
            countrymen warlike, not in order that they might do <lb/>
            wrong, but that they might not be wronged. Each found <lb/>
            that the existing system required very important altera­ <lb/>
            tions to check its excesses and supply its defects. Numa's <lb/>
            reforms were all in favour of the people, whom he classified <lb/>
            into a mixed and motley multitude of goldsmiths and <lb/>
            musicians and cobblers; while the constitution introduced <lb/>
            by Lykurgus was severely aristocratic, driving all handi­ <lb/>
            crafts into the hands of slaves and foreigners, and con­ <lb/>
            fining the citizens to the use of the spear and shield, as <lb/>
            men whose trade was war alone, and who knew nothing <lb/>
            but how to obey their leaders and to conquer their enemies. <lb/>
            In Sparta a free man was not permitted to make money in <lb/>
            business, in order that he might be truly free.</p>
          <p>Each thing connected with the business of making <lb/>
            money, like that of preparing food for dinner, was left in <lb/>
            the hands of slaves and helots. Numa made no regulations <lb/>
            of this kind, but, while he put an end to military plun­ <lb/>
            dering, raised no objection to other methods of making <lb/>
            money, nor did he try to reduce inequalities of fortune. <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            but allowed wealth to increase unchecked, and disregarded <lb/>
            the influx of poor men into the city and the increase of <lb/>
            poverty there, whereas he ought at the very outset, like <lb/>
            Lykurgus, while men's fortunes were still tolerably equal, <lb/>
            to have raised some barrier against the encroachments of <lb/>
            wealth, and to have restrained the terrible evils which <lb/>
            take their rise and origin in it. As for the division of the <lb/>
            land among the citizens, in my opinion, Lykurgus cannot <lb/>
            be blamed for doing it, nor yet can Numa for not doing it. <lb/>
            The equality thus produced was the very foundation and <lb/>
            corner-stone of the Lacedaemonian constitution, while <lb/>
            Numa had no motive for disturbing the Roman lands, which <lb/>
            had only been recently distributed among the citizens, or <lb/>
            to alter the arrangements made by Romulus, which we <lb/>
            may suppose were still in force throughout the country.</p>
          <p>III. With regard to a community of wives and children, <lb/>
            each took a wise and statesman-like course to prevent <lb/>
            jealousy, although the means employed by each wore <lb/>
            different. A Roman who possessed a sufficient family of <lb/>
            his own might be prevailed upon by a friend who had no <lb/>
            children to transfer his wife to him, being fully empowered <lb/>
            to give her away, by divorce, for this purpose; but a <lb/>
            Lacedaemonian was accustomed to lend his wife for inter­ <lb/>
            course with a friend, while she remained living in his <lb/>
            house, and without the marriage being thereby dissolved. <lb/>
            Many, we are told, even invited those who, they thought, <lb/>
            would beget fine and noble children, to converse with the ir <lb/>
            wives. The distinction between the two customs seems to <lb/>
            be this : the Spartans affected an unconcern and insensi­ <lb/>
            bility about a matter which excites most men to violent <lb/>
            rage and jealousy; the Romans modestly veiled it by a <lb/>
            legal contract which seems to admit how hard it is for <lb/>
            a man to give up his wife to another. Moreover Numa's <lb/>
            regulations about young girls were of a much more <lb/>
            feminine and orderly nature, while those of Lykurgus <lb/>
            were so highflown and unbecoming to women, as to have <lb/>
            been the subject of notice by the poets, who call them <lb/>
            Phainomerides, that is with bare thighs, as Ibykus says ; <lb/>
            and they accuse them of lust, as Euripides says— <lb/>
            “ They stay not, as befits a maid, at home, <lb/>
            But with young men in shameless dresses room.” <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            For in truth the sides of the maiden's tunic were not <lb/>
            fastened together at the skirt, and so flew open and <lb/>
            exposed the thigh as they walked, which is most clearly <lb/>
            alluded to in the lines of Sophokles— <lb/>
            “ She that wanders nigh, <lb/>
            With scanty skirt that shows the thigh, <lb/>
            A Spartan maiden fair and free, <lb/>
            Hermione." <lb/>
            On this account they are said to have become bolder than <lb/>
            they should be, and to have first shown this spirit towards <lb/>
            their husbands, ruling uncontrolled over their households, <lb/>
            and afterwards in public matters, where they freely ex­ <lb/>
            pressed their opinions upon the most important subjects. <lb/>
            On the other hand, Numa preserved that respect and <lb/>
            honour due from men to matrons which they had met <lb/>
            with under Romulus, who paid them these honours to <lb/>
            atone for having carried them off by force, but he im­ <lb/>
            planted in them habits of modesty, sobriety, and silence, <lb/>
            forbidding them even to touch wine, or to speak even <lb/>
            when necessary except in their husbands' presence. It is <lb/>
            stated that once, because a woman pleaded her own cause <lb/>
            in the Forum, the Senate sent to ask the oracle what this <lb/>
            strange event might portend for the state.</p>
          <p>A great proof of the obedience and modesty of the most <lb/>
            part of them is the way in which the names of those who <lb/>
            did any wrong is remembered. For, just as in Greece, <lb/>
            historians record the names of those who first made war <lb/>
            against their own kindred or murdered their parents, so <lb/>
            the Romans tell us that the first man who put away his <lb/>
            wife was Spurius Carvilius, nothing of the kind having <lb/>
            happened in Rome for two hundred and thirty years from <lb/>
            its foundation; and that the wife of Pinarius, Thaisea by <lb/>
            name, was the first to quarrel with her mother-in-law <lb/>
            Gegania in the reign of Tarquinius Superbus—so well <lb/>
            and orderly were marriages arranged by this lawgiver.</p>
          <p>IV. The rest of their laws for the training and marriage <lb/>
            of maidens agree with one another, although Lykurgus <lb/>
            put off the time of marriage till they were full-grown, in <lb/>
            order that their intercourse, demanded as it was by nature, <lb/>
            mig1t produce love and friendship in the married pair <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            rather than the dislike often experienced by aL immature <lb/>
            child towards her husband, and also that their bodies <lb/>
            might be better able to support the trials of child-bearing, <lb/>
            which he regarded as the sole object of marriage ; whereas <lb/>
            the Romans gave their daughters in marriage at the age <lb/>
            of twelve years or even younger, thinking thus to hand <lb/>
            over a girl to her husband pure and uncorrupt both in <lb/>
            body and mind. It is clear that the former system is best <lb/>
            for the mere production of children, and the latter for <lb/>
            moulding consorts for life. But by his superintendence <lb/>
            of the young, his collecting them into companies, his <lb/>
            training and drill, with the table and exercises common <lb/>
            to all, Lykurgus showed that he was immensely superior <lb/>
            to Numa, who, like any commonplace lawgiver, left the <lb/>
            whole training of the young in the hands of their fathers, <lb/>
            regulated only by their caprice or needs ; so that whoever <lb/>
            chose might bring up his son as a shipwright, a copper­ <lb/>
            smith, or a musician, as though the citizens ought not <lb/>
            from the very outset to direct their attention to one object, <lb/>
            but were like people who have embarked in the same <lb/>
            ship for various causes, who only in time of danger act <lb/>
            together for the common advantage of all, and at other <lb/>
            times pursue each his own private ends. Allowance must <lb/>
            be made for ordinary lawgivers, who fail through want of <lb/>
            power or of knowledge in establishing such a system; <lb/>
            but no such excuse can be made for Numa, who was a <lb/>
            wise man, and who was made king of a newly-created <lb/>
            state which would not have opposed any of his designs. <lb/>
            What could be of greater importance than to regulate the <lb/>
            education of the young and so to train them that they <lb/>
            might all become alike in their lives and all bear the same <lb/>
            impress of virtue ? It was to this that Lykurgus owed <lb/>
            the permanence of his laws; for he could not have trusted <lb/>
            to the oaths which he made them take, if he had not by <lb/>
            education and training so steeped the minds of the young <lb/>
            in the spirit of his laws, and by his method of bringing <lb/>
            them up implanted in them such a love for the state, that <lb/>
            the most important of his enactments remained in force <lb/>
            for more than five hundred years; for the lives of all <lb/>
            Spartans seem to have been coloured by these laws. That <lb/>
            which was the aim and end of Numa's policy, that Rome <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            should be at peace and friendly with her neighbours, <lb/>
            ceased immediately upon his death; at once the double­ <lb/>
            gated temple, which he kept closed as if he really kept <lb/>
            war locked up in it, had both its gates thrown open and <lb/>
            filled Italy with slaughter. His excellent and righteous <lb/>
            policy did not last for a moment, for the people were not <lb/>
            educated to support it, and therefore it could not be <lb/>
            lasting. But, it may be asked, did not Rome flourish by <lb/>
            her wars? It is hard to answer such a question, in an <lb/>
            age which values wealth, luxury, and dominion more than <lb/>
            a gentle peaceful life that wrongs no one and suffices for <lb/>
            itself. Yet this fact seems to tell for Lykurgus, that the <lb/>
            Romans gained such an enormous increase of power by <lb/>
            departing from Numa's policy, while the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            as soon as they fell away from the discipline of Lykurgus, <lb/>
            having been the haughtiest became the most contemptible <lb/>
            of Greeks, and not only lost their supremacy, but had <lb/>
            even to struggle for their bare existence. On the other <lb/>
            hand, it was truly glorious for Numa that he was a <lb/>
            stranger and sent for by the Romans to be their king; <lb/>
            that he effected all his reforms without violence, and ruled <lb/>
            a city composed of discordant elements without any armed <lb/>
            force such as Lykurgus had to assist him, winning over <lb/>
            all men and reducing them to order by his wisdom and <lb/>
            justice. <note type="footnote"> It </note></p>

            laws which he wrote in answer to Asklepiades, quotes a <lb/>
            saying of one Philokles, that Solon was the son of <lb/>
            Euphorion, which is quite at variance with the testimony <lb/>
            of all other writers who have mentioned Solon: for they <lb/>
            all say that he was the son of Exekestides, a man whose <lb/>
            fortune and power were only moderate, but whose family <lb/>
            was of the noblest in Athens ; for he was descended from <lb/>
            Kodrus the last Athenian king. Herakleides of Pontus <lb/>
            relates that the mother of Solon was first cousin to the <lb/>
            mother of Peisistratus. The two boys, we are told, were <lb/>
            friends when young, and when in after years they differed <lb/>
            in politics they still never entertained harsh or angry <lb/>
            feelings towards one another, but kept alive the sacred <lb/>
            flame of their former intimate friendship. Peisistratus <lb/>
            is even said to have dedicated the statue of Love in the <lb/>
            Academy where those who are going to run in the sacred <lb/>
            torch-race light their torches.</p>
          <p>II. According to Hermippus, Solon, finding that his <lb/>
            father had by his generosity diminished his fortune, and <lb/>
            feeling ashamed to be dependent upon others, when he <lb/>
            himself was come of a house more accustomed to give <lb/>
            than to receive, embarked in trade, although his friends <lb/>
            were eager to supply him with all that he could wish for. <lb/>
            Some, however, say that Solon travelled more with a view <lb/>
            to gaining experience and learning than to making <lb/>
            money. lie was indeed eager to learn, as he wrote when <lb/>
            an old man, <lb/>
            " Old to grow, but ever learning," <lb/>
            but disregarded wealth, for he wrote that he regarded as <lb/>
            equally rich the man who owned <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            “ Gold and broad acres, corn and wine ; <lb/>
            And he that hath but clothes and food, <lb/>
            A wife, and youthful strength divine." <lb/>
            Yet elsewhere he has written, but <lb/>
            “ I long for wealth, not by fraud obtained, <lb/>
            For curses wait on riches basely gained.” <lb/>
            There is no reason for an upright statesman either to be <lb/>
            over anxious for luxuries or to despise necessaries. At <lb/>
            that period, as Hesiod tells us, “ Work was no disgrace," <lb/>
            nor did trade carry any reproach, while the profession of <lb/>
            travelling merchant was even honourable, as it civilised <lb/>
            barbarous tribes, and gained the friendship of kings, and <lb/>
            learned much in many lands. Some merchants founded <lb/>
            great cities, as, for example, Protis, who was beloved by the <lb/>
            Gauls living near the Rhone, founded Marseilles. It is <lb/>
            also said that Thales the sage, and Hippocrates the mathe­ <lb/>
            matician, travelled as merchants, and that Plato defrayed <lb/>
            the expenses of his journey to Egypt by the oil which he <lb/>
            disposed of in that country.</p>
          <p>III. Solon's extravagance and luxurious mode of life, <lb/>
            and his poems, which treat of pleasure more from a <lb/>
            worldly than a philosophic point of view, are attributed <lb/>
            to his mercantile training; for the great perils of a <lb/>
            merchants life require to be paid in corresponding <lb/>
            pleasures. Yet it is clear that he considered himself as <lb/>
            belonging to the class of the poor, rather than that of the <lb/>
            rich, from the following verses : <lb/>
            “ The base are rich, the good are poor; and yet <lb/>
            Our virtue for their gold we would not change; <lb/>
            For that at least is ours for evermore, <lb/>
            While wealth we see from hand to hand doth range." <lb/>
            His poetry was originally written merely for his own <lb/>
            amusement in his leisure hours ; but afterwards he intro­ <lb/>
            duced into it philosophic sentiments, and interwove <lb/>
            political events with his poems, not in order to record <lb/>
            them historically, but in some cases to explain his own <lb/>
            conduct, and in others to instruct, encourage, or rebuke <lb/>
            the Athenians. Some say that he endeavoured to throw <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            his laws into an epic form, and tell us that the poem <lb/>
            began­ <lb/>
            “ To Jove I pray, great Saturn's son divine, <lb/>
            To grant his favour to these laws of mine.” <lb/>
            Of ethical philosophy, he, like most of the sages of <lb/>
            antiquity, was most interested in that branch which deals <lb/>
            with political obligations. As to natural science, his <lb/>
            views are very crude and antiquated, as we see from the <lb/>
            following verses: <lb/>
            “ From clouds the snow and hail descend, <lb/>
            And thunderbolts the lightnings send; <lb/>
            The waves run high when gales do blow, <lb/>
            Without the wind they're still enow." <lb/>
            Indeed, of all the sages of that time, Thales alone seems <lb/>
            to have known more of physics than was necessary to <lb/>
            supply man's every-day needs; all the others having <lb/>
            gained their reputation for political wisdom.</p>
          <p>IV. These wise men are said to have met at Delphi, and <lb/>
            again at Corinth, where they were entertained by the <lb/>
            despot Periander. Their reputation was greatly increased <lb/>
            by the tripod which was sent to all of them and refused <lb/>
            by all with a gracious rivalry. The story goes that some <lb/>
            men of Cos were casting a net, and some strangers from <lb/>
            Miletus bought the haul of them before it reached the <lb/>
            surface.</p>
          <p>The net brought up a golden tripod, the same which, it <lb/>
            is said, Helen threw into the sea at that spot, in accordance <lb/>
            with some ancient oracle, when she was sailing away <lb/>
            from Troy. A dispute arose at first between the strangers <lb/>
            and the fishermen; afterwards it was taken up by their <lb/>
            respective cities, who even came to blows about it. <lb/>
            Finally they consulted the oracle at Delphi, which <lb/>
            ordered it to be given to the wisest. Now it was first <lb/>
            sent to Miletus, to Thales, as the men of Cos willingly gave <lb/>
            it to that one man, although they had fought with all the <lb/>
            Milesians together about it. Thales said that Bias was <lb/>
            wiser than himself, and sent it to him ; and by him it was <lb/>
            again sent to another man, as being wiser yet. So it <lb/>
            went on, being sent from one to another until it came to <lb/>
            Thales a second time, and at last was sent from Miletus to <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            Thebes and consecrated to Apollo Ismenius. As Theo­ <lb/>
            phrastus tells the story, the tripod was first sent to Bias at <lb/>
            Priene, and secondly to Thales at Miletus, and so on <lb/>
            through all of the wise men until it again reached Bias, <lb/>
            and was finally offered at Delphi. This is the more <lb/>
            common version of the story, although some say that it <lb/>
            was not a tripod but a bowl sent by Crœsus, others that <lb/>
            it was a drinking-cup left behind by one Bathykles.</p>
          <p>V. Anacharsis is said to have met Solon, and after­ <lb/>
            wards Thales in private, and to have conversed with them. <lb/>
            The story goes that Anacharsis came to Athens, went to <lb/>
            Solon's door, and knocked, saying that he was a stranger <lb/>
            and had come to enter into friendship with him. When <lb/>
            Solon answered that friendships were best made at home, <lb/>
            Anacharsis said, " Well then, do you, who are at home, <lb/>
            enter into friendship with me." Solon, admiring the <lb/>
            man's cleverness, received him kindly, and kept him for <lb/>
            some time in his house. He was at this time engaged in <lb/>
            politics, and was composing his laws. Anacharsis, when <lb/>
            he discovered this, laughed at Solon's undertaking, if he <lb/>
            thought to restrain the crimes and greed of the citizens by <lb/>
            written laws, which he said were just like spiders' webs; <lb/>
            for, like them, they caught the weaker criminals, but <lb/>
            were broken through by the stronger and more important.</p>
          <p>To this Solon answered, that men keep covenants, <lb/>
            because it is to the advantage of neither party to break <lb/>
            them; and that he so suited his laws to his countrymen, <lb/>
            that it was to the advantage of every one to abide by <lb/>
            them rather than to break them. Nevertheless, things <lb/>
            turned out more as Anacharsis thought than as Solon <lb/>
            wished. Anacharsis said too, when present at an as­ <lb/>
            sembly of the people, that he was surprised to see that in <lb/>
            Greece wise men spoke upon public affairs, and ignorant <lb/>
            men decided them.</p>
          <p>VI. When Solon went to Thales at Miletus, he expressed <lb/>
            his wonder at his having never married and had a family. <lb/>
            Thales made no answer at the time, but a few days <lb/>
            afterwards arranged that a man should come to him and <lb/>
            say that he left Athens ten days before. When Solon <lb/>
            inquired of him, whether anything new had happened at <lb/>
            Athens, the man answered, as Thales had instructed him, <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            that" there was no news, except the death of a young man <lb/>
            who had been escorted to his grave by the whole city. <lb/>
            He was the son, they told him, of a leading citizen of <lb/>
            great repute for his goodness, but the father was not <lb/>
            present, for they said he had been travelling abroad for <lb/>
            some years." " Unhappy man," said Solon, " what was his <lb/>
            name ? " u I heard his name," answered the man, it but I <lb/>
            cannot remember it; beyond that there was much talk of <lb/>
            his wisdom and justice." Thus by each of his answers he <lb/>
            increased Solon's alarm, until he at last in his excitement <lb/>
            asked the stranger whether it were not Solon's son that <lb/>
            was dead. The stranger said that it was. Solon was <lb/>
            proceeding to beat his head and show all the other marks <lb/>
            of grief, when Thales stopped him, saying with a smile, <lb/>
            “ This, Solon, which has the power to strike down so strong <lb/>
            a man as you, has ever prevented my marrying and <lb/>
            having children. But be of good courage, for this tale <lb/>
            which you have been told is untrue." This story is said <lb/>
            by Hermippus to have been told by Pataikos, he who said <lb/>
            that he had inherited the soul of Æsop.</p>
          <p>VII. It is a strange and unworthy feeling that prompts <lb/>
            a man not to claim that to which he has a right, for fear <lb/>
            that he may one day lose it; for by the same reasoning he <lb/>
            might refuse wealth, reputation, or wisdom, for fear of <lb/>
            losing them hereafter. We see even virtue, the greatest <lb/>
            and most dear of all possessions, can be destroyed by <lb/>
            disease or evil drugs; and Thales by avoiding marriage <lb/>
            still had just as much to fear, unless indeed he ceased to <lb/>
            love his friends, his kinsmen, and his native land. But even <lb/>
            he adopted his sister's son Kybisthus; for the soul has <lb/>
            a spring of affection within it, and is formed not only to <lb/>
            perceive, to reflect, and to remember, but also to love. If <lb/>
            it finds nothing to love at home, it will find something <lb/>
            abroad; and when affection, like a desert spot, has no <lb/>
            legitimate possessors, it is usurped by bastard children or <lb/>
            even servants, who when they have obtained our love, <lb/>
            make us fear for them and be anxious about them. So <lb/>
            that one may often see men, in a cynical temper, inveighing <lb/>
            against marriage and children, who themselves shortly <lb/>
            afterwards will be plunged into unmanly excesses of grief, <lb/>
            at the loss of their child by some slave or concubine. <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            Some have even shown terrible grief at. the death of dogs <lb/>
            and horses; whereas others, who have lost noble sons, made <lb/>
            no unusual or unseemly exhibition of sorrow, but passed <lb/>
            the remainder of their lives calmly and composedly. <lb/>
            Indeed it is weakness, not affection, which produces such <lb/>
            endless misery and dread to those who have not learned to <lb/>
            take a rational view of the uncertainty of life, and who <lb/>
            cannot enjoy the presence of their loved ones because of <lb/>
            their constant agony for fear of losing them. We should <lb/>
            not make ourselves poor for fear of losing our property, <lb/>
            nor should we guard ourselves against a possible loss of <lb/>
            friends by making none ; still less ought we to avoid <lb/>
            having children for fear that our child might die. But <lb/>
            we have already dwelt too much upon this subject.</p>
          <p>VIII. After a long and harassing war with the <lb/>
            Megarians about the possession of the Island of Salamis, <lb/>
            the Athenians finally gave up in sheer weariness, and <lb/>
            passed a law forbidding any one for the future, either to <lb/>
            speak or to write in favour of the Athenian claim to Salamis, <lb/>
            upon pain of death. Solon, grieved at this dishonour, and <lb/>
            observing that many of the younger men were eager for <lb/>
            an excuse to fight, but dared not propose to do so because <lb/>
            of this law, pretended to have lost his reason. His family <lb/>
            gave out that he was insane, but he meanwhile composed <lb/>
            a poem, and when he had learned it by heart, rushed out <lb/>
            into the market-place wearing a small felt cap, and having <lb/>
            assembled a crowd, mounted the herald's stone and recited <lb/>
            the poem which begins with the lines­ <lb/>
            “ A herald I from Salamis am come, <lb/>
            My verse will tell you what should there be done." <lb/>
            The name of this poem is Salamis; it consists of a <lb/>
            hundred beautifully written lines. After he had sung it, <lb/>
            his friends began to commend it, and Peisistratus made a <lb/>
            speech to the people, which caused such enthusiasm that <lb/>
            they abrogated the law and renewed the war, with Solon as <lb/>
            their leader. The common version of the story runs thus : <lb/>
            Solon sailed with Peisistratus to Kolias, where he found <lb/>
            all the women of the city performing the customary sacrifice <lb/>
            to Demeter (Ceres). At the same time, he sent a trusty man <lb/>
            to Salamis, who represented himself as a deserter, and bade <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            the Megarians follow him at once to Kolias, if they wished <lb/>
            to capture all the women of the first Athenian families. <lb/>
            The Megarians were duped, and sent off a force in a ship. <lb/>
            As soon as Solon saw this ship sail away from the island, he <lb/>
            ordered the women out of the way, dressed up those young <lb/>
            men who were still beardless in their clothes, headdresses, <lb/>
            and shoes, gave them daggers, and ordered them to <lb/>
            dance and disport themselves near the seashore until the <lb/>
            enemy landed, and their ship was certain to be captured, <lb/>
            So the Megarians, imagining them to be women, fell upon <lb/>
            them, struggling which should first seize them, but they <lb/>
            were cut off to a man by the Athenians, who at once sailed <lb/>
            to Salamis and captured it.</p>
          <p>IX. Others say that the island was not taken in this <lb/>
            way, but that first of all Solon received the following <lb/>
            oracular response from Apollo at Delphi: <lb/>
            “ Appease the land's true lords, the heroes blest, <lb/>
            Who near Asopia's fair margin rest, <lb/>
            And from their tombs still look towards the West.” <lb/>
            After this, Solon is said to have sailed by night, un­ <lb/>
            noticed by the Megarians, and to have sacrificed to the <lb/>
            heroes Periphemus and Kychreus. His next act was to <lb/>
            raise five hundred Athenian volunteers, who by a public <lb/>
            decree were to be absolute masters of the island if they <lb/>
            could conquer it. With these he set sail in a number of <lb/>
            fishing-boats, with a triaconter or ship of war of thirty <lb/>
            oars, sailing in company, and anchored off a certain cape <lb/>
            which stretches towards Eubœa. The Megarians in <lb/>
            Euboea heard an indistinct rumour of this, and at once <lb/>
            ran to arms, and sent a ship to reconnoitre the enemy. <lb/>
            This ship, when it came near Solon's fleet, was captured and <lb/>
            its crew taken prisoners. On board of it Solon placed <lb/>
            some picked men, and ordered them to make sail for the <lb/>
            city of of Salamis, and to conceal themselves as far as they <lb/>
            could. Meanwhile he with the remaining Athenians <lb/>
            attacked the Megarian forces by land; and while the <lb/>
            battle was at its hottest, the men in the ship succeeded in <lb/>
            surprising the city.</p>
          <p>This story appears to be borne out by the proceedings <lb/>
            which were instituted in memory of the capture. In this <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            ceremony an Athenian ship used to sail to Salamis, at first <lb/>
            in silence, and then as they neared the shore with warlike <lb/>
            shouts. Then a man completely armed used to leap out <lb/>
            and run, shouting as he went, up to the top of the hill <lb/>
            called Skiradion, where he met those who came by land. <lb/>
            Close by this place stands the temple of Ares, which Solon <lb/>
            built; for he conquered the Megarians in the battle, and <lb/>
            sent away the survivors with a flag of truce.</p>
          <p>X. However, as the Megarians still continued the war, <lb/>
            to the great misery of both sides, they agreed to make the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians arbitrators and judges between them. <lb/>
            Most writers say that Solon brought the great authority <lb/>
            of Homer's Iliad' to his aid, by interpolating in the <lb/>
            catologue of ships the two verses-­ <lb/>
            “Ajax from Salamis twelve vessels good <lb/>
            Brought, and he placed them where th' Athenians stood," <lb/>
            which he had read as evidence before the court.</p>
          <p>The Athenians, however, say that all this is nonsense, <lb/>
            but that Solon proved to the arbitrators that Philæus and <lb/>
            Eurysakes, the sons of Ajax, when they were enrolled as <lb/>
            Athenian citizens, made over the island to Athens, and <lb/>
            dwelt, one at Brauron, in Attica, and the other at Melite ; <lb/>
            moreover, there is an Athenian tribe which claims descent <lb/>
            from Philæus, to which Peisistratus belonged. Wishing, <lb/>
            however, yet more thoroughly to prove his case against <lb/>
            the Megarians, he based an argument on the tombs in the <lb/>
            island, in which the corpses were buried, not in the <lb/>
            Megarian, but in the Athenian manner. For the Megarians <lb/>
            bury their dead looking towards the east, and the Athenians <lb/>
            towards the west. But Hereas of Megara denies this, and <lb/>
            frays that the Megarians also bury their dead looking to­ <lb/>
            wards the west, and moreover, that each Athenian had a <lb/>
            coffin to himself, while the Megarians place two or three <lb/>
            bodies in one coffin. However, Solon supported his case <lb/>
            by quoting certain oracles from Delphi, in which the god <lb/>
            addresses Salamis as Ionian. The Spartan arbitrators <lb/>
            were five in number, their names being Kritolaidas, <lb/>
            Amompharetus, Hypsichidas, Anaxilos, and Kleomones.</p>
          <p>XI. Solon's reputation and power were greatly increased <lb/>
            By this. But he became much more celebrated and well- <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            known in Greece by his speeches on behalf of the temple <lb/>
            at Delphi, in which he urged the necessity of checking the <lb/>
            insolent conduct of the people of Kirrha towards the temple, <lb/>
            and of rallying in defence of the god. The Amphiktyons, <lb/>
            prevailed upon by his eloquence, declared war, as we learn <lb/>
            from Aristotle, among other writers, in his book about the <lb/>
            winners of the prize at the Pythian games, in which he at­ <lb/>
            tributes this decision to Solon. However, he was not made <lb/>
            general in that war, as Hermippus relates, quoting from <lb/>
            Evanthes of Samos; for AEschines the orator does not men­ <lb/>
            tion him, and, in the records of Delphi, Alkmæon, not Solon, <lb/>
            is mentioned as general of the Athenians on that occasion.</p>
          <p>XII. Athens had long been suffering from the anger of <lb/>
            the gods, which it had incurred by the treatment of <lb/>
            Kylon's party. These conspirators took sanctuary in <lb/>
            Athene's temple, but were induced by Megakles the <lb/>
            archon to quit it and stand their trial. They fastened a <lb/>
            thread to the shrine of the goddess, and kept hold of it so <lb/>
            as still to be under her protection. But as they were <lb/>
            coming down from the Acropolis, just beside the temple of <lb/>
            the Furies, the string broke, and Megakles and the other <lb/>
            archons, thinking that the goddess rejected their appeal, <lb/>
            seized them. Some of them were stoned to death out­ <lb/>
            side the temple, and some who had fled for sanctuary to <lb/>
            the altars were slain there. Only those who fell as sup­ <lb/>
            pliants at the feet of the archons' wives were spared. <lb/>
            After this the archons were called accursed, and were <lb/>
            viewed with horror; moreover, the survivors of Kylon's <lb/>
            party regained strength, and continued their intrigues <lb/>
            against Megakles and the archons. At the time of which <lb/>
            we are speaking these dissensions had reached their height, <lb/>
            and the city was divided into two factions, when Solon, <lb/>
            who was already a man of great reputation, came forward <lb/>
            with some of the noblest Athenians, and by his entreaties <lb/>
            and arguments prevailed upon those magistrates who were <lb/>
            called accursed, to stand trial and be judged by a jury of <lb/>
            three hundred citizens selected from the best families. <lb/>
            Myron of Phlya prosecuted, and the archons were found <lb/>
            guilty, and forced to leave the country. The bodies of <lb/>
            such of them as had died were dug up, and cast out <lb/>
            beyond the borders of Attica.</p><pb n="139"/>
            
          <p>During these disorders the Athenians were again attacked <lb/>
            by the Megarians, and lost Nisæa, and were again driven <lb/>
            out of Salamis. The city was also a prey to superstitions <lb/>
            terrors, and apparitions were seen, so that the prophets, <lb/>
            after inspecting their victims, said that the city was <lb/>
            polluted and under a curse, and that it required purification. <lb/>
            Upon this they seat for Epimenides the Phæstian, of Crete, <lb/>
            who is reckoned an ong the seven wise men of Greece, by <lb/>
            some of those who do not admit Periander into their <lb/>
            number. He was thought to enjoy the favour of Heaven, <lb/>
            and was skilled in all the lore of the sacred mysteries, <lb/>
            and in the sources of divine inspiration; wherefore he was <lb/>
            commonly reported to be the child of the nymph Balte, <lb/>
            and to be one of the old Curetes of Crete revived. He <lb/>
            came to Athens and was a friend to Solon, assisting him <lb/>
            greatly in his legislation. He remodelled their religious <lb/>
            rites, and made their mourning more moderate, introducing <lb/>
            certain sacrifices shortly after the funeral, and abolishing <lb/>
            the harsh and barbarous treatment which women were for <lb/>
            the most part subject to before in times of mourning. <lb/>
            Above all, by purifications and atoning sacrifices, and the <lb/>
            erection of new temples, he so sanctified and hallowed the <lb/>
            city as to make the minds of the people obedient to the <lb/>
            laws, and easily guided into unity and concord. It is said <lb/>
            that he saw Munychia, and viewed it carefully for some <lb/>
            time in silence. Then he said to the bystanders, " How <lb/>
            blind is man to the future. The Athenians would eat this <lb/>
            place up with their teeth if they knew what misfortunes <lb/>
            it will bring upon them ? A prophetic saying of the same <lb/>
            kind is attributed to Thales. He bade his friends bury <lb/>
            him in a low and neglected quarter of Miletus, telling <lb/>
            them that one day it would be the market-place of the <lb/>
            city. Epimenides was greatly honoured by the Athenians, <lb/>
            and was offered large sums of money by them, and great <lb/>
            privileges, but he refused them all, and only asked for a <lb/>
            branch of the sacred olive-tree, which he received and <lb/>
            went his way.</p>
          <p>XIII. When the troubles about Kylon were over, and <lb/>
            the accursed men cast out of the country, the Athenians <lb/>
            relapsed into their old dispute about the constitution. <lb/>
            The state was divided into as many factions as there were <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            parts of the country, for the Diakrii, or mountaineers, <lb/>
            favoured democracy; the Pediœi, oligarchy; while those <lb/>
            who dwelt along the seashore, called Parali, preferred a <lb/>
            constitution midway between these two forms, and thus <lb/>
            prevented either of the other parties from carrying their <lb/>
            point. Moreover, the state was on the verge of revolution, <lb/>
            because of the excessive poverty of some citizens, and the <lb/>
            enormous wealth of others, and it appeared that the only <lb/>
            means of putting an end to these disorders was by esta­ <lb/>
            blishing an absolute despotism. The whole people were <lb/>
            in debt to a few wealthy men; they either cultivated their <lb/>
            farms, in which case they were obliged to pay one-sixth <lb/>
            of the profit to their creditors, and were called Hektemori, <lb/>
            or servants, or else they had raised loans upon personal <lb/>
            security, and had become the slaves of their creditors, who <lb/>
            either employed them at home, or sold them to foreigners. <lb/>
            Many were even compelled to sell their own children, <lb/>
            which was not illegal, and to leave the country because <lb/>
            of the harshness of their creditors.</p>
          <p>The greater part, and those of most spirit, combined <lb/>
            together, and encouraged one another not to suffer such <lb/>
            oppression any longer, but to choose some trustworthy <lb/>
            person to protect their interests, to set free all enslaved <lb/>
            debtors, redistribute the land, and, in a word, entirely re­ <lb/>
            model the constitution.</p>
          <p>XIV. In this position of affairs, the most sensible men <lb/>
            in Athens perceived that Solon was a person who shared <lb/>
            the vices of neither faction, as he took no part in the <lb/>
            oppressive conduct of the wealthy, and yet had sufficient <lb/>
            fortune to save him from the straits to which the poor <lb/>
            were reduced. In consequence of this, they begged him <lb/>
            to come forward and end their disputes. But Phanias of <lb/>
            Lesbos says that Solon deceived both parties, in order to <lb/>
            save the state, promising the poor a redistribution of lands, <lb/>
            and the rich a confirmation of their securities. However, <lb/>
            Solon himself tells us that it was with reluctance that <lb/>
            he interfered, as he was threatened by the avarice of the <lb/>
            one party, and the desperation of the other. He was chosen <lb/>
            archon next after Philombrotus, to act as an arbitrator <lb/>
            and lawgiver at once, because the rich had confidence in <lb/>
            him as a man of easy fortune, and the poor trusted him as <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            a good man. It is said also that a saying which he had <lb/>
            let fall some time before, that " equality does not breed <lb/>
            strife," was much circulated at the time, and pleased <lb/>
            both parties, because the rich thought it meant that <lb/>
            property should be distributed according to merit and <lb/>
            desert, while the poor thought it meant according to rule <lb/>
            and measure. Both parties were now elate with hope, <lb/>
            and their leaders urged Solon to seize the supreme power <lb/>
            in the state, of which he was practically possessed, and <lb/>
            make himself king. Many even of the more moderate <lb/>
            class of politicians, who saw how weary and difficult a <lb/>
            task it would be to reform the state by debates and <lb/>
            legislative measures, were quite willing that so wise and <lb/>
            honest a man should undertake the sole management of <lb/>
            affairs. It is even said that Solon received an oracle as <lb/>
            follows: <lb/>
            “ Take thou the helm, the vessel guide, <lb/>
            Athens will rally to thy side." <lb/>
            His intimate friends were loudest in their reproaches, <lb/>
            pointing out that it was merely the name of despot from <lb/>
            which he shrunk, and that in his case his virtues would <lb/>
            lead men to regard him as a legitimate hereditary <lb/>
            sovereign; instancing also Tunnondas, who in former <lb/>
            times had been chosen by the Euboeans, and, at the <lb/>
            present time, Pittakus, who had been chosen king of <lb/>
            Mitylene. But nothing could shake Solon's determination. <lb/>
            He told his friends that monarchy is indeed a pleasant <lb/>
            place, but there is no way out of it; and he inserted the <lb/>
            following verses in answer to Phokus, in one of his <lb/>
            poems: <lb/>
            " But if I spared <lb/>
            My country, and with dread tyrannic sway, <lb/>
            Forbore to stain and to pollute my glory; <lb/>
            I feel no shame at this; nay rather thus, <lb/>
            I think that I excel mankind." <lb/>
            From which it is clear that he possessed a great reputation <lb/>
            even before he became the lawgiver of Athens.</p>
          <p>In answer to the reproaches of many of his friends at <lb/>
            his refusal to make himself despot, he wrote as follows:<lb/>
            " Not a clever man was Solon, not a calculating mind, <lb/>
            For he would not take the kingdom, which the gods to him inclined, <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            In his net he caught the prey, but would not draw it forth to land, <lb/>
            Overpowered by his terrors, feeble both of heart and hand ; <lb/>
            For a man of greater spirit would have occupied the throne, <lb/>
            Proud to be the Lord of Athens, though 'twere for a day alone, <lb/>
            Though the next day he and his into oblivion were thrown."</p>
          <p>XV. This is the way in which he says the masses, and <lb/>
            low-minded men, spoke of him. He, however, firmly re­ <lb/>
            jecting the throne, proceeded quietly to administer public <lb/>
            affairs, in laying down his laws without any weak yielding <lb/>
            to the powerful, or any attempt to court popularity. <lb/>
            Such as were good, he did not meddle with, fearing that <lb/>
            if he <lb/>
            “Disturbed and overset the state," <lb/>
            he might not have sufficient power to <lb/>
            " Reconstitute and organise again, It <lb/>
            in the best way. He carried out his measures by persua­ <lb/>
            sion, and, where he thought he could succeed, by force; <lb/>
            in his own words, <lb/>
            “Combining Force and Justice both together." <lb/>
            Being afterwards asked whether he had composed the <lb/>
            best possible laws for the Athenians, he answered, " The <lb/>
            best that they would endure." And the habit of Athenians <lb/>
            of later times, who soften down harsh words by using <lb/>
            politer equivalents, calling harlots "mistresses," taxes <lb/>
            “contributions, garrisons of cities " protectors," and the <lb/>
            common prison “ the house," was, it seems, first invented <lb/>
            by Solon, who devised the name of " relief from burdens ” <lb/>
            for his measure to abolish all debts.</p>
          <p>This was his first measure; namely, to put an end to <lb/>
            all existing debts and obligations, and to forbid any one <lb/>
            in future to lend money upon security of the person of the <lb/>
            debtor. Some writers, among whom is Androtion, say <lb/>
            that he benefited the poor, not by the absolute extinction <lb/>
            of debt, but by establishing a lower rate of interest; and <lb/>
            that this measure was called “ Relief from burdens," and <lb/>
            together with it the two other measures for the enlarge­ <lb/>
            ment of measures and of the value of money, which were <lb/>
            passed about the same time. For he ordered a mina. <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            which was before constituted of seventy three drachmas, to <lb/>
            contain a hundred, so that, though they paid the same <lb/>
            amount, yet the value was less; thus those who had <lb/>
            much to pay were benefited, and still their creditors were <lb/>
            not cheated. But most writers say that the “ Relief from <lb/>
            burdens " meant the extinction of all securities whatever, <lb/>
            and this agrees best with what we read in his poems. <lb/>
            For Solon prides himself in these upon having <lb/>
            “ Taken off the mortgages, which on the land were laid, <lb/>
            And made the country free, which was formerly enslaved." <lb/>
            While he speaks of bringing back Athenian citizens <lb/>
            who had been sold into slavery abroad, <lb/>
            “ In distant lands who roam, <lb/>
            Their native tongue forgot, <lb/>
            Or here endure at home <lb/>
            A slave's disgraceful lot," <lb/>
            and of making them free men again.</p>
          <p>It is said that in consequence of this measure he met <lb/>
            with the greatest trouble of his life. As he was meditating <lb/>
            how he might put an end to debt, and what words and <lb/>
            preambles were best for the introduction of this law, he <lb/>
            took counsel with his most intimate friends, such as Konon <lb/>
            and Kleinias and Hipponikus, informing them that he had <lb/>
            no intention of interfering with the tenure of land, but <lb/>
            that he intended to abolishing all existing securities. <lb/>
            They instantly took time by the forelock, borrowed large <lb/>
            sums from the wealthy, and bought up a great extent of <lb/>
            land. Presently the decree came forth, and they re­ <lb/>
            mained in enjoyment of these estates, but did not repay <lb/>
            their loan to their creditors. This brought Solon into <lb/>
            great discredit, for the people believed that he had been <lb/>
            their accomplice. But he soon proved that this must be <lb/>
            false, by remitting a debt of five talents which he himself <lb/>
            had lent; and some state the sum at fifteen talents, <lb/>
            amongst whom is Polyzelus of Rhodes. However, his <lb/>
            friends were for ever afterwards called " The Swindlers."</p>
          <p>XVI. By this measure he pleased neither party, but <lb/>
            the rich were dissatisfied at the loss of their securities, and <lb/>
            the poor were still more so because the land was not <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            divided afresh, as they hoped it would be, and because he <lb/>
            had not, like Lykurgus, established absolute equality.</p>
          <p>But Lykurgus was eleventh in direct descent from <lb/>
            Herakles, and had reigned in Lacedæmon for many years, <lb/>
            and had his own great reputation, friends, and interest to <lb/>
            assist him in carrying out his reforms; and although he <lb/>
            chose to effect his purpose by violence, so that his eye was <lb/>
            actually knocked out, yet he succeeded in carrying that <lb/>
            measure so valuable for the safety and concord of the state, <lb/>
            by which it was rendered impossible for any citizen to be <lb/>
            either rich or poor. Solon's power could not reach this <lb/>
            height, as he was only a commoner and a moderate man; <lb/>
            yet he did all that was in his power, relying solely upon <lb/>
            the confidence and goodwill of his countrymen.</p>
          <p>It is clear that they were disappointed, and expected <lb/>
            more from his legislation, from his own verses­ <lb/>
            " Once they speculated gaily, what good luck should them befall, <lb/>
            Now they look upon me coldly, as a traitor to them all." <lb/>
            Yet he says, if any one else had been in his position, <lb/>
            “ He ne'er would have desisted from unsettling the laws, <lb/>
            Till lie himself got all the cream." <lb/>
            However, not long afterwards, they perceived the public <lb/>
            benefits which he had conferred upon them, forgot their <lb/>
            private grievances, and made a public sacrifice in honour <lb/>
            of the Seisachtheia, or " Relief from burdens." Moreover, <lb/>
            they constituted Solon supreme reformer and lawgiver, <lb/>
            not over some departments only, but placing everything <lb/>
            alike in his hands; magistracies, public assemblies, senate, <lb/>
            and law-oourts. He had full powers to confirm or abolish <lb/>
            any of these, and to fix the proper qualifications for mem­ <lb/>
            bers of them, and their numbers and times of meeting.</p>
          <p>XVII. First of all, then, he repealed all the laws of Drakon, <lb/>
            except those relating to murder, because of their harshness <lb/>
            and the excessive punishments which they awarded. For <lb/>
            death was the punishment for almost every offence, so that <lb/>
            even men convicted of idleness were executed, and those <lb/>
            who stole pot-herbs or fruits Buffered just like sacrilegious <lb/>
            robbers and murderers. So that lJemades afterwards made <lb/>
            the joke that Drakon's laws were not written with ink, but <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            with blood. It is said that Drakon himself, when asked <lb/>
            why he had fixed the punishment of death for most offences, <lb/>
            answered that he considered these lesser crimes to deserve <lb/>
            it, and he had no greater punishment for more important <lb/>
            ones.</p>
          <p>X VIII. In the next place, Solon, who wished to leave all <lb/>
            magistracies as he found them, in the hands of the wealthy <lb/>
            classes, but to give the people a share in the rest of <lb/>
            the constitution, from which they were then excluded, took <lb/>
            a census of the wealth of the citizens, and made a first class <lb/>
            of those who had an annual income of not less than five <lb/>
            hundred medimni of dry or liquid produce ; these he called <lb/>
            Pentakosiomedimni. The next class were the Hippeis, <lb/>
            or knights, consisting of those who were able to keep a <lb/>
            horse, or who had an income of three hundred medimni. <lb/>
            The third class were the Zeugitæ, whose property quali­ <lb/>
            fication was two hundred medimni of dry or liquid produce ; <lb/>
            and the last class were the Thetes, whom Solon did not <lb/>
            permit to be magistrates, but whose only political privilege <lb/>
            was the right of attending the public assemblies and <lb/>
            sitting as jurymen in the law courts. This privilege was <lb/>
            at first insignificant, but afterwards became of infinite im­ <lb/>
            portance, because most disputes were settled before a jury. <lb/>
            Even in those cases which he allowed the magistrates to <lb/>
            settle, he provided a final appeal to the people.</p>
          <p>Solon moreover is said to have purposely worded his <lb/>
            laws vaguely and with several interpretations, in order to <lb/>
            increase the powers of these juries, because persons who <lb/>
            could not settle their disputes by the letter of the law <lb/>
            were obliged to have recourse to juries of the people, and <lb/>
            to refer all disputes to them, as being to a certain extent <lb/>
            above the laws. He himself notices this in the following <lb/>
            verses: <lb/>
            “ I gave the people all the strength they needed, <lb/>
            Yet kept the power of the nobles strong; <lb/>
            Thus each from other's violence I shielded, <lb/>
            Not letting either do the other wrong." <lb/>
            Thinking that the weakness of the populace required <lb/>
            still further protection, he permitted any man to prosecute <lb/>
            on behalf of any other who might be ill-treated. Thus if <lb/>
            a man were struck or injured, any one else who was able <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            and willing might prosecute on his behalf, and the law­ <lb/>
            giver by this means endeavoured to make the whole body <lb/>
            of citizens act together and feel as one. A saying of his <lb/>
            is recorded which quite agrees with the spirit of this law. <lb/>
            Being asked, what he thought was the best managed city ? <lb/>
            “ That," he answered, in which those who are not wronged <lb/>
            espouse the cause of those who are, and punish their <lb/>
            oppressors."</p>
          <p>XIX. He established the senate of the Areopagus <lb/>
            of those who had held the yearly office of archon, and <lb/>
            himself became a member of it because he had been archon. <lb/>
            But in addition to this, observing that the people were <lb/>
            becoming turbulent and unruly, in consequence of their <lb/>
            relief from debt, he formed a second senate, consisting <lb/>
            of a hundred men selected from each of the four tribes, to <lb/>
            deliberate on measures in the first instance, and he per­ <lb/>
            mitted no measures to be proposed before the general <lb/>
            assembly, which had not been previously discussed in <lb/>
            this senate. The upper senate he intended to exercise <lb/>
            a general supervision, and to maintain the laws, and he <lb/>
            thought that with these two senates as her anchors, the <lb/>
            ship of the state would ride more securely, and that the <lb/>
            people would be less inclined to disorder. Most writers <lb/>
            say that Solon constituted the senate of the Areopagus, as <lb/>
            is related above; and this view is supported by the fact <lb/>
            that Dragon nowhere mentions or names the Areopagites, <lb/>
            but in all cases of murder refers to the Ephetai. However, <lb/>
            the eighth law on the thirteenth table of the laws of Solon <lb/>
            runs thus :­</p>
          <p>" All citizens who were disfranchised before the magis­ <lb/>
            tracy of Solon shall resume their rights, except those who <lb/>
            have been condemned by the Areopagus, or by the Ephetai, <lb/>
            or by the king—archons, in the prytaneum, for murder or <lb/>
            manslaughter, or attempts to overthrow the government <lb/>
            and who were in exile when this law was made."</p>
          <p>This again proves that the senate of the Areopagus <lb/>
            existed before the time of Solon; for who could those <lb/>
            persons be who were condemned by the court of the Areo­ <lb/>
            pagus, if Solon was the first who gave the senate of the <lb/>
            Areopagus a criminal jurisdiction ; though perhaps some <lb/>
            words have been left out, or indistinctly written, and the <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            law means " all those who had been condemned on the <lb/>
            charges which now are judged by the court of the Areo­ <lb/>
            pagus, the Ephetai, or the Prytanies, when this law was <lb/>
            made, must remain disfranchised, though the others become <lb/>
            enfranchised ? " Of these explanations the reader himself <lb/>
            must consider which he prefers.</p>
          <p>XX. The strangest of his remaining laws is that which <lb/>
            declared disfranchised a citizen who in a party conflict <lb/>
            took neither side ; apparently his object was to prevent any <lb/>
            one regarding home politics in a listless, uninterested <lb/>
            fashion, securing his own personal property, and priding <lb/>
            himself upon exemption from the misfortunes of his <lb/>
            country, and to encourage men boldly to attach themselves <lb/>
            to the right party and to share all its dangers, rather than <lb/>
            in safety to watch and see which side would be successful. <lb/>
            That also is a strange and even ludicrous provision in one <lb/>
            of his laws, which permits an heiress, whose husband <lb/>
            proves impotent, to avail herself of the services of the next <lb/>
            of kin to obtain an heir to her estate. Some, however, say <lb/>
            that this law rightly serves men who know themselves to <lb/>
            be unfit for marriage, and who nevertheless marry heiresses <lb/>
            for their money, and try to make the laws override nature ; <lb/>
            for, when they see their wife having intercourse with <lb/>
            whom she pleases, they will either break off the marriage, <lb/>
            or live in constant shame, and so pay the penalty of their <lb/>
            avarice and wrong-doing. It is a good provision also, that <lb/>
            the heiress may not converse with any one, but only with <lb/>
            him whom she may choose from among her husband's <lb/>
            relations, so that her offspring may be all in the family. <lb/>
            This is pointed at by his ordinance that the bride and <lb/>
            bridegroom should be shut in the same room and eat a <lb/>
            quince together, and that the husband of an heiress should <lb/>
            approach her at least thrice in each month. For even if <lb/>
            no children are born, still this is a mark of respect to a <lb/>
            good wife, and puts an end to many misunderstandings, <lb/>
            preventing their leading to an actual quarrel.</p>
          <p>In other marriages he suppressed dowries, and ordered <lb/>
            the bride to bring to her husband three dresses and a few <lb/>
            articles of furniture of no great value; for he did not wish <lb/>
            marriages to be treated as money bargains or means of <lb/>
            gain, but that men and women should enter into marriage <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            for love and happiness and procreation of children. Diony. <lb/>
            sius, the despot of Syracuse, when his mother wished to be <lb/>
            married to a young citizen, told her that he had indeed <lb/>
            broken the laws of the state when he seized the throne, but <lb/>
            that he could not disregard the laws of nature so far as to <lb/>
            countenance such a monstrous union. These dispropor­ <lb/>
            tioned matches ought not to be permitted in any state, nor <lb/>
            should men be allowed to form unequal loveless alliances, <lb/>
            which are in no sense true marriages. A magistrate or <lb/>
            lawgiver might well address an old man who marries a <lb/>
            young girl in the words of Sophokles: “ Poor wretch, <lb/>
            a hopeful bridegroom you will be;" and if he found a <lb/>
            young man fattening like a partridge in the house of a <lb/>
            rich old woman, he ought to transfer him to some young <lb/>
            maiden who is without a husband. So much for this <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>XXI. Besides these, Solon's law which forbids men to <lb/>
            speak evil of the dead is much praised. It is good to think <lb/>
            of the departed as sacred, and it is only just to refrain from <lb/>
            attacking the absent, while it is politic, also, to prevent <lb/>
            hatred from being eternal. He also forbade people to speak <lb/>
            evil of the living in temples, courts of justice, public <lb/>
            buildings, or during the national games; and imposed a <lb/>
            fine of three drachmas to the person offended, and two to the <lb/>
            state. His reason for this was that it shows a violent and <lb/>
            uncultivated nature not to be able to restrain one's passion <lb/>
            in certain places and at certain times, although it is hard <lb/>
            to do so always, and to some persons impossible; and a <lb/>
            legislator should frame his laws with a view to what he <lb/>
            can reasonably hope to effect, and rather correct a few <lb/>
            persons usefully than punish a number to no purpose.</p>
          <p>He gained credit also by his law about wills. Before <lb/>
            his time these were not permitted at Athens, but the money <lb/>
            and lands of a deceased person were inherited by his <lb/>
            family in all cases. Solon, however, permitted any one <lb/>
            who had no children to leave his property to whom he <lb/>
            would, honouring friendship more than nearness of kin, <lb/>
            and giving a man absolute power to dispose of his inheri­ <lb/>
            tance. Yet, on the other hand, he did not permit legacies <lb/>
            to be given without any restrictions, but disallowed all <lb/>
            that were obtained by the effects of disease or by adminis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            tration of drugs to the testator, or by imprisonment and <lb/>
            violence, or by the solicitations of his wife, as he rightly <lb/>
            considered that to be persuaded by one's wife against one's <lb/>
            better judgment is the same as to submit to force. For <lb/>
            Solon held that a man's reason was perverted by deceit as <lb/>
            much as by violence, and by pleasure no less than by <lb/>
            pain.</p>
          <p>He regulated, moreover, the journeys of the women, and <lb/>
            their mournings and festivals. A woman was not allowed <lb/>
            to travel with more than three dresses, nor with more than <lb/>
            an obolus' worth of food or drink, nor a basket more than <lb/>
            a cubit in length ; nor was she to travel at night, except in <lb/>
            a waggon with a light carried in front of it. He abolished <lb/>
            the habits of tearing themselves at funerals, and of reciting <lb/>
            set forms of dirges, and of hiring mourners. He also for­ <lb/>
            bade them to sacrifice an ox for the funeral feast, and to <lb/>
            bury more than three garments with the body, and to visit <lb/>
            other persons' graves. Most of these things are forbidden <lb/>
            by our own laws also; with the addition, that by our laws <lb/>
            those who offend thus are fined by the gynæconomi, or <lb/>
            regulators of the women, for giving way to unmanly <lb/>
            and womanish sorrow.</p>
          <p>XXII. Observing that the city was filled with men who <lb/>
            came from all countries to take refuge in Attica, that the <lb/>
            country was for the most part poor and unproductive, and <lb/>
            that merchants also are unwilling to despatch cargoes to <lb/>
            a country which has nothing to export, he encouraged his <lb/>
            countrymen to embark in trade, and made a law that a <lb/>
            son was not obliged to support his father, if his father had <lb/>
            not taught him a trade. As for Lykurgus, whose city was <lb/>
            clear of strangers, and whose land was " unstinted, and <lb/>
            with room for twice the number," as Euripides says, and <lb/>
            who above all had all the Helots, throughout Lacedaemon, <lb/>
            who were best kept employed, in order to break their spirit <lb/>
            by labour and hardship, it was very well that his citizens <lb/>
            should disdain laborious handicrafts and devote their whole <lb/>
            attention to the art of war.</p>
          <p>But Solon had not the power to change the whole life <lb/>
            of his countrymen by his laws, but rather was forced to <lb/>
            suit his laws to existing circumstances, and, as he saw that <lb/>
            the soil was so poor that it could only suffice for the farmers, <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            and was unable to feed a mass of idle people as well, he <lb/>
            gave great honour to trade, and gave powers to the senate <lb/>
            of the Areopagus to inquire what each man's source of <lb/>
            income might be, and to punish the idle. A harsher <lb/>
            measure was that of which we are told by Herakleides <lb/>
            of Pontus, his making it unnecessary for illegitimate chil­ <lb/>
            dren to maintain their father. Yet if a man abstains from <lb/>
            an honourable marriage, and lives with a woman more for <lb/>
            his own pleasure in her society than with a view to <lb/>
            producing a family, he is rightly served, and cannot <lb/>
            upbraid his children with neglecting him, because he has <lb/>
            made their birth their reproach.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Altogether Solon's laws concerning women are <lb/>
            very strange. He permitted a husband to kill an adulterer <lb/>
            taken in the act; but if any one carried off a free woman <lb/>
            and forced her, he assessed the penalty at one hundred <lb/>
            drachmas. If he obtained her favours by persuasion, he <lb/>
            was to pay twenty drachmas, except in the case of those <lb/>
            who openly ply for hire, alluding to harlots; for they <lb/>
            come to those who offer them money without any conceal­ <lb/>
            ment. Moreover, he forbade men to sell their sisters and <lb/>
            daughters, except in the case of unchastity. Now to punish <lb/>
            the same offence at one time with unrelenting severity, <lb/>
            and at another in a light and trifling manner, by imposing <lb/>
            so slight a fine, is unreasonable, unless the scarcity of <lb/>
            specie in the city at that period made fines which were <lb/>
            paid in money more valuable than they would now be; <lb/>
            indeed, in the valuation of things for sacrifice, a sheep and <lb/>
            a drachma were reckoned as each equal to a medimnus of <lb/>
            corn. To the victor at the Isthmian games he appointed <lb/>
            a reward of a hundred drachmas, and to the victor in the <lb/>
            Olympian, five hundred. He gave five drachmas for every <lb/>
            wolf that was killed, and one drachma for every wolf's <lb/>
            whelp; and we are told by Demetrius of Phalerum that <lb/>
            the first of these sums was the price of an ox, and the <lb/>
            second that of a sheep. The prices of choice victims, which <lb/>
            he settled in his sixteenth tablet of laws, would naturally be <lb/>
            higher than those of ordinary beasts, but even thus they <lb/>
            are cheap compared with prices at the present day. It <lb/>
            was an ancient practice among the Athenians to destroy <lb/>
            the wolves, because their country was bettor fitted for <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            pasture than for growing crops. Some say that the <lb/>
            Athenian tribes derive their names, not from the sons of <lb/>
            Ion, but from the different professions in which men were <lb/>
            then divided: thus the fighting men were named Hoplites, <lb/>
            and the tradesmen Ergadeis; the two remaining ones <lb/>
            being the Geleontes, or farmers, and the Aigikoreis, or <lb/>
            goat-herds and graziers. With regard to water, as the <lb/>
            country is not supplied with either rivers or lakes, but <lb/>
            the people depend chiefly upon artificial wells, he made a <lb/>
            law, that wherever there was a public well within four <lb/>
            furlongs, people should use it, but if it were farther off, <lb/>
            then they must dig a private well for themselves; but if a <lb/>
            man dug a depth of sixty feet on his own estate without <lb/>
            finding water, then he was to have the right of filling a <lb/>
            six-gallon pitcher twice a day at his neighbour's well; for <lb/>
            Solon thought it right to help the distressed, and yet not <lb/>
            to encourage laziness. He also made very judicious regu­ <lb/>
            lations about planting trees, ordering that they should <lb/>
            not be planted within five feet of a neighbour's property, <lb/>
            except in the case of olives and fig-trees, which were not <lb/>
            to be planted within nine feet; for these trees spread out <lb/>
            their roots farther than others, and spoil the growth of <lb/>
            any others by taking away their nourishment and by <lb/>
            giving off hurtful juices. Trenches and pits he ordered <lb/>
            to be dug as far away from another man's property as they <lb/>
            were deep; and no hive of bees was to be placed within <lb/>
            three hundred feet of those already established by another <lb/>
            man.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Oil was the only product of the country which <lb/>
            he allowed to be exported, everything else being forbidden; <lb/>
            and he ordered that if any one broke this law the archon <lb/>
            was to solemnly curse him, unless he paid a hundred <lb/>
            drachmas into the public treasury. This law is written on <lb/>
            the first of his tablets. From this we see that the old <lb/>
            story is not altogether incredible, that the export of figs <lb/>
            was forbidden, and that the men who informed against <lb/>
            those who had done so were therefore called sycophants. <lb/>
            He also made laws about damage received from animals, <lb/>
            one of which was that a dog who had bitten a man should <lb/>
            be delivered up to him tied to a stick three cubits long, <lb/>
            an ingenious device for safety.</p><pb n="152"/>
            
          <p>One is astounded at his law of adopting foreigners into <lb/>
            the state, which permits no one to become a full citizen in <lb/>
            Athens unless he be either exiled for life from his native <lb/>
            city, or transfers himself with his whole family to Athens <lb/>
            to practise his trade there. It is said that his object in <lb/>
            this was not so much to exclude other classes of people <lb/>
            from the city, as to assure these of a safe refuge there; <lb/>
            and these he thought would be good and faithful citizens, <lb/>
            because the former had been banished from their own <lb/>
            country, and the latter had abandoned it of their own <lb/>
            freewill. Another peculiarity of Solon's laws was the <lb/>
            public dining-table in the prytaneum. Here he did not <lb/>
            allow the same person to dine often, while he punished the <lb/>
            man who was invited and would not come, because the <lb/>
            one seemed gluttonous, and the other contemptuous.</p>
          <p>XXV. He ordered that all his laws should remain in <lb/>
            force for a hundred years, and he wrote them upon <lb/>
            triangular wooden tablets, which revolved upon an axis in <lb/>
            oblong recesses, some small remains of which have been <lb/>
            preserved in the prytaneum down to the present day. <lb/>
            These, we are told by Aristotle, were called Kurbeis. The <lb/>
            comic poet Kratinus also says, <lb/>
            “ By Solon and by Draco, mighty legislators once, <lb/>
            Whose tablets light the fire now to warm a dish of pulse." <lb/>
            Some say that the term Kurbeis is only applied to those <lb/>
            on which are written the laws which regulate religious <lb/>
            matters.</p>
          <p>The senate swore by a collective oath that it would <lb/>
            enforce Solon's laws; and each of the Thesmothetæ took an <lb/>
            oath to the same effect at the altar in the market-place, <lb/>
            protesting that, if he transgressed any of the laws, he <lb/>
            would offer a golden statue as big as himself to the temple <lb/>
            at Delphi.</p>
          <p>Observing the irregularity of the months, and that the <lb/>
            motions of the moon did not accord either with the rising <lb/>
            or setting of the sun, but that frequently she in the same <lb/>
            day overtakes and passes by him, he ordered that day to <lb/>
            be called " the old and the new," and that the part of it <lb/>
            before their conjunction should belong to the old month, <lb/>
            while the rest of the day after it belonged to the new one, <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            being, it seems, the first to rightly interpret the verse of <lb/>
            Homer— <lb/>
            " The old month ended and the new began." <lb/>
            He called the next day that of the new moon. After the <lb/>
            twentieth, he no longer reckoned forwards, but backwards, <lb/>
            as the moon decreased, until the thirtieth of the month.</p>
          <p>When Solon had passed all his laws, as people came to <lb/>
            him every day to praise or blame, or advise him to add or <lb/>
            take away from what he had written, while innumerable <lb/>
            people wanted to ask questions, and discuss points, and kept <lb/>
            bidding him explain what was the object of this or that <lb/>
            regulation, he, feeling that he could not do all this, and <lb/>
            that, if he did not, his motives would be misunderstood; <lb/>
            wishing, moreover, to escape from troubles and the criticism <lb/>
            and fault-finding of his countrymen [for, as he himself <lb/>
            writes, it is “ Hard in great measures every one to please "], <lb/>
            made his private commercial business an excuse for <lb/>
            leaving the country, and set sail after having obtained <lb/>
            from the Athenians leave of absence for ten years. In <lb/>
            this time he thought they would become used to his laws.</p>
          <p>XXVI. He first went to Egypt, where he spent some <lb/>
            time, as he himself says, <lb/>
            " At Nilus' outlets, by Canopus' strand." <lb/>
            And he also discussed points of philosophy with Psenophis <lb/>
            of Heliopolis, and with Sonchis of Sais, the most dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished of the Egyptian priests. From them he heard <lb/>
            the tale of the island Atlantis, as we are told by Plato, <lb/>
            and endeavoured to translate it into a poetical form for <lb/>
            the enjoyment of his countrymen. He next sailed to <lb/>
            Cyprus, where he was warmly received by Philocyprus, <lb/>
            one of the local sovereigns, who ruled over a small city <lb/>
            founded by Demophon, the son of Theseus, near the river <lb/>
            Klarius, in a position which was easily defended, but <lb/>
            inconvenient.</p>
          <p>As a fair plain lay below, Solon persuaded him to <lb/>
            remove the city to a pleasanter and less contracted site, <lb/>
            and himself personally superintended the building of the <lb/>
            new city, which he arranged so well both for convenience <lb/>
            and safety, that many new settlers joined Philocyprus, and <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            he was envied by the neighbouring kings. For this reason, <lb/>
            in honour of Solon, he named the new city Soloi, the name <lb/>
            of the old one having been Aipeia. Solon himself mentions <lb/>
            this event, in one of his elegiac poems, in which he <lb/>
            addresses Philocyprus, saying­ <lb/>
            “ Long may'st thou reign, <lb/>
            Ruling thy race from Soloi's throne with glory, <lb/>
            But me may Venus of the violet crown <lb/>
            Send safe away from Cyprus famed in story. <lb/>
            May Heaven to these new walls propitious prove, <lb/>
            Aud bear me safely to the land I love."</p>
          <p>XXVII. Some writers argue, on chronological grounds, <lb/>
            that Solon's meeting with Crœsus must have been an <lb/>
            invention. But I cannot think that so famous a story, <lb/>
            which is confirmed by so many writers, and, moreover, <lb/>
            which so truly exhibits Solon's greatness of mind and <lb/>
            wisdom, ought to be given up because of the so-called <lb/>
            rules of chronology, which have been discussed by <lb/>
            innumerable persons, up to the present day, without their <lb/>
            being ever able to make their dates agree. The story goes <lb/>
            that Solon at Crœsus's desire came to Sardis, and there <lb/>
            felt much like a continental when he goes down to the <lb/>
            seaside for the first time; for he thinks each river he <lb/>
            comes to must be the sea, and so Solon, as he walked <lb/>
            through the court and saw many of the courtiers richly <lb/>
            attired and each of them swaggering about with a train <lb/>
            of attendants and body-guards, thought that each one <lb/>
            must be the king, until he was brought before the king <lb/>
            himself, who, as far as precious stones, richly dyed clothes, <lb/>
            and cunningly worked gold could adorn him, was splendid <lb/>
            and admirable, indeed a grand and gorgeous spectacle to <lb/>
            behold. When Solon was brought into his presence, he <lb/>
            showed none of the feelings and made none of the remarks <lb/>
            about the sight, which Crœsus expected, but evidently <lb/>
            despised such vulgar ostentation. Crœsus then ordered <lb/>
            his treasures to be exhibited to him, and all the rest of his <lb/>
            possessions and valuables ; not that Solon needed this, for <lb/>
            the sight of Crœsus himself was enough to show him what <lb/>
            sort of man he was. When, after having seen all this, he <lb/>
            was again brought before the king, Crœsus asked him <lb/>
            whether he knew any man more happy than himself. <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            Solon at once answered that one Tellus, a fellow-country­ <lb/>
            man of his own, was more happy. He explained that <lb/>
            Tellus was a good man, and left a family of good sons; <lb/>
            that he passed his life beyond the reach of want, and died <lb/>
            gloriously in battle for his country. At this, Crœsus <lb/>
            began to think that Solon must be a cross-grained churlish <lb/>
            fellow, if he did not measure happiness by silver and gold, <lb/>
            but preferred the life and death of some private man of <lb/>
            low degree to such power and empire as his. However, he <lb/>
            asked him a second time, whether he knew any one more <lb/>
            happy than himself, next to Tellus. Solon answered that <lb/>
            he knew two men, Kleobis and Biton, remarkable for their <lb/>
            love for each other and for their mother, who, as the oxen <lb/>
            that drew their mother travelled slowly, put themselves <lb/>
            under the yoke and drew the carriage with her in it to <lb/>
            the temple of Here. She was congratulated by all the <lb/>
            citizens, and was very proud of them; and they offered <lb/>
            sacrifice, drank some wine, and then passed away by a <lb/>
            painless death after so much glory.</p>
          <p>" Then," asked Crœsus angrily, " do you not reckon me <lb/>
            at all among happy men ? " Solon, who did not wish to <lb/>
            flatter him, nor yet to exasperate him farther, answered, <lb/>
            " 0 King of the Lydians, we Greeks have been endowed <lb/>
            with moderate gifts, by Heaven, and our wisdom is of <lb/>
            a cautious and homely cast, not of a royal and magnificent <lb/>
            character; so, being moderate itself, and seeing the mani­ <lb/>
            fold chances to which life is exposed, it does not permit <lb/>
            us to take a pride in our present possessions, nor to admire <lb/>
            the good fortune of any man when it is liable to change. <lb/>
            Strange things await every man in the unknown future; <lb/>
            and we think that man alone happy whose life has been <lb/>
            brought to a fortunate termination. To congratulate a man <lb/>
            who is yet alive and exposed to the caprice of fortune is <lb/>
            like proclaiming and crowning as victor one who has not <lb/>
            yet run his race, for his good fortune is uncertain and <lb/>
            liable to reversal." After speaking thus, Solon took his <lb/>
            leave, having enraged Croesus, who could not take his <lb/>
            good advice.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Æsop, the writer of the fables, who had been <lb/>
            sent for to Sardis by Crœsus and enjoyed his favour, was <lb/>
            vexed at the king'a ungracious reception of Solon, and <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            advised him thus: “ Solon," said he, " one ought either <lb/>
            to say very little to kings or else say what they wish most <lb/>
            to hear." " Not so," said Solon; “ one should either say <lb/>
            very little to them, or else say what is best for them to <lb/>
            hear." So at that time Crœsus despised Solon ; but after <lb/>
            he had been defeated by Cyrus, his city taken, and he <lb/>
            himself was about to be burned alive upon a pyre erected <lb/>
            in the presence of all the Persians and of Cyrus himself, <lb/>
            then he thrice cried out, “ Solon," as loud as he could. <lb/>
            Cyrus, surprised at this, sent to ask what man or god <lb/>
            Solon might be, who was invoked by a man in such ex­ <lb/>
            tremity. Croesus, without any concealment said, “ He is <lb/>
            one of the wise men of Greece, whom I sent for, not <lb/>
            because I wished to listen to him and learn what I was <lb/>
            ignorant of, but in order that he might see and tell of my <lb/>
            wealth, which I find it is a greater misfortune to lose than <lb/>
            it was a blessing to possess. For, while I possessed it, all <lb/>
            I enjoyed was opinion and empty talk; whereas, now the <lb/>
            loss of it has brought me in very deed into terrible and <lb/>
            irreparable misfortunes and sufferings. Now this man, <lb/>
            who foresaw what might befall me, bade me look to the end <lb/>
            of my life, and not be arrogant on the strength of a fleeting <lb/>
            prosperity."</p>
          <p>When this was reported to Cyrus, he being a wiser man <lb/>
            than Crœsus, and finding Solon's words strongly borne out <lb/>
            by the example before him, not only released Crœsus, but <lb/>
            treated him with favour for the rest of his life; so that <lb/>
            Solon had the glory of having by the same words saved <lb/>
            one king's life and given instruction to another.</p>
          <p>XXIX. During Solon's absence the strife of the factions <lb/>
            at Athens was renewed; Lykurgus was the chief of the <lb/>
            party of the Pediæi, Megakles, the son of Alkmæon, led <lb/>
            the Parali, and Peisistratus, the Diakrii, who were joined <lb/>
            by the mass of the poorer classes who hated the rich. Thus <lb/>
            the city still obeyed Solon's laws, but was longing for <lb/>
            change, and all men hoped for a new revolution, in which <lb/>
            they trusted to get not only their rights, but something <lb/>
            more, and to triumph over the opposite faction. In this <lb/>
            state of affairs Solon landed at Athens, and was received <lb/>
            with respect by all the citizens. Although, on account of <lb/>
            his age, he was no longer able to engage in politics as keenly <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            as before, still he met the leaders of the various factions <lb/>
            privately and endeavoured to arrange their differences and <lb/>
            reconcile them to one another. Peisistratus appeared to <lb/>
            pay more attention to him than the others, for he was <lb/>
            crafty and pleasant of speech, a protector of the poor, and <lb/>
            a man of moderation even in his quarrels. The qualities <lb/>
            which he had not, he affected to possess, giving himself <lb/>
            out to be a cautious and law-abiding man, who loved even­ <lb/>
            handed justice and was enraged at any revolutionary <lb/>
            proceedings. Thus he deceived the people; but Solon <lb/>
            soon saw through him, and detected his plans before any <lb/>
            one else. He was not shocked, but endeavoured to turn <lb/>
            him from his purpose by advice, saying to him and to <lb/>
            others that if his desire to be first and his wish to make <lb/>
            himself master could be removed, there would be no <lb/>
            more excellent and virtuous citizen than Peisistratus.</p>
          <p>At this time Thespis was beginning to introduce the <lb/>
            drama, and the novelty of his exhibition attracted many <lb/>
            people, although the regular contests were not yet intro­ <lb/>
            duced. Solon, who was fond of seeing sights and gaining <lb/>
            knowledge, and whose old age was spent in leisure and <lb/>
            amusements and good fellowship, went to see Thespis, <lb/>
            who acted in his own play, as the ancient custom was. <lb/>
            After the play was over, he asked him if he was not <lb/>
            ashamed to tell so many lies before so many people. <lb/>
            When Thespis answered that there was no harm in say­ <lb/>
            ing and doing these things in jest, Solon violently struck <lb/>
            the ground with his stick, saying, “ If we praise and <lb/>
            approve of such jests as these, we shall soon find people <lb/>
            jesting with our business."</p>
          <p>XXX. When Peisistratus wounded himself and was <lb/>
            driven into the market-place in a cart to excite the people, <lb/>
            whom he told that he had been so treated by his enemies <lb/>
            because he defended the constitution, and while he was <lb/>
            surrounded by a noisy crowd of sympathisers, Solon came <lb/>
            near him and said, “Son of Hippokrates, you are dis­ <lb/>
            honourably imitating Homer's Ulysses. You are doing <lb/>
            this to deceive your fellow citizens, while he mutilated <lb/>
            himself to deceive the enemy." Upon this, as the people <lb/>
            were willing to take up arms on behalf of Peisistratus, <lb/>
            they assembled at the Pnyx, where Ariston proposed that <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            a body-guard of fifty club-bearers should be assigned to <lb/>
            Peisistratus. Solon opposed this, urging many arguments, <lb/>
            like what we read in his poems : <lb/>
            “ You bang upon a crafty speaker's words ;” <lb/>
            and again, <lb/>
            “ Each alone a fox in cunning, <lb/>
            You grow stupid when you meet." <lb/>
            But as he saw that the poor were eager to serve Peisis­ <lb/>
            tratus, while the rich held back from cowardice, he went <lb/>
            away, after saying that he was wiser than the one class, <lb/>
            and braver than the other; wiser, namely, than those who <lb/>
            did not understand what was going on, and braver than <lb/>
            those who did understand, but did not dare to oppose the <lb/>
            despotism with which they were threatened.</p>
          <p>The people carried the proposal, and would not be so <lb/>
            mean as to make any stipulation with Peisistratus about <lb/>
            the number of his body-guard, but permitted him to keep <lb/>
            as many as he pleased until he seized the Acropolis. When <lb/>
            this took place, the city was convulsed; Megakles and the <lb/>
            other descendants of Alkmæon fled, but Solon, although he <lb/>
            was now very old and had no one to stand by him, never­ <lb/>
            theless came into the market-place and addressed the citi­ <lb/>
            zens, reproaching them for their folly and remissness, and <lb/>
            urging them to make a final effort to retain their freedom. <lb/>
            It was then that he made the memorable remark that, in <lb/>
            former days it would have been easier for them to have <lb/>
            prevented despotism from appearing amongst them, but <lb/>
            that now it would be more glorious to cut it down, when <lb/>
            it had arrived at its full growth. However, as no one <lb/>
            listened to him, because of the general terror, he went <lb/>
            home, armed himself, and took his post in the street out­ <lb/>
            side his door, saying, “ I have done all I could for my <lb/>
            country and her laws." After this he remained quiet, <lb/>
            though his friends urged him to leave Athens. He, how­ <lb/>
            ever, wrote poems reproaching the Athenians— <lb/>
            “ Through your own cowardice you suffered wrong, <lb/>
            Blame then yourselves and not the gods for this; <lb/>
            'Twas you yourselves that made the tyrant strong, <lb/>
            And rightly do you now your freedom miss."</p>
          <p>XXXI. At this many of his friends told him that the <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            despot would surely put him to death, and when they asked <lb/>
            him what he trusted to, that he performed such mad freaks, <lb/>
            he answered, " To my age." But Peisistratus, after he <lb/>
            became established as sovereign, showed such marked <lb/>
            favour to Solon that he even was advised by him, and <lb/>
            received his approval in several cases. For he enforced <lb/>
            most of Solon's laws, both observing them himself and <lb/>
            obliging his friends to do so. Indeed, when accused of <lb/>
            murder before the court of the Areopagus, he appeared in <lb/>
            due form to stand his trial, but his accuser let the case <lb/>
            fall through. He also made other laws himself, one of <lb/>
            which is that those who are maimed in war shall be kept <lb/>
            at the public expense. Herakleides says that this was <lb/>
            done in imitation of Solon, who had already proposed it in <lb/>
            the case of Thersippus. But Theophrastus tells us that it <lb/>
            was not Solon, but Peisistratus, who made the law about <lb/>
            idleness, by means of which he rendered the city more <lb/>
            quiet, and the country better cultivated.</p>
          <p>Solon also attempted to write a great poem about the fable <lb/>
            of ‘ Atlantis,’ which he had learned from the chroniclers of <lb/>
            Sais particularly concerned the Athenians, but he did not <lb/>
            finish it, not, as Plato says, for want of leisure, but rather <lb/>
            because of his advanced age, which made him fear that <lb/>
            the task was too great for him. His own words tell us <lb/>
            that he had abundance of leisure — <lb/>
            “ Old I grow, but ever learning," <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            “ Venus and Bacchus are all my care, <lb/>
            And the Muses, that charm the hearts of men." <lb/>
            Plato eagerly took in hand the scheme of the Atlantis,’ <lb/>
            as though it were a fine site for a palace, which had come <lb/>
            to be his by inheritance, still unbuilt on. He placed in <lb/>
            the beginning of it such splendid entrance-halls and <lb/>
            vestibules as we find in no other tale or legend or poem, <lb/>
            but, as he began the work too late, he died before he was <lb/>
            able to finish it; so that the more we enjoy what he has <lb/>
            written, the more we grieve over what is lost. As the <lb/>
            temple of Olympic Zeus among the temples of Athens, so <lb/>
            the ‘ Atlantis' is the only one among Plato's many noble <lb/>
            writings that is unfinished.</p><pb n="160"/>
            
          <p>Solon lived on into the reign of Peisistratus for a <lb/>
            long time, according to Herakleides of Pontus, but less <lb/>
            than two years, according to Phanias of Eresus. For <lb/>
            Peisistratus became despot in the archonship of Komius, <lb/>
            and Phanias tells us that Solon died during the archonship <lb/>
            of Hegesistratus, Komias' successor. The story that his <lb/>
            ashes were scattered round the island of Salamis is <lb/>
            legendary and improbable, yet it is confirmed by many <lb/>
            trustworthy writers, amongst whom is the philosophei <lb/>
            Aristotle.</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF POPLICOLA.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. As a parallel to Solon we shall take Poplicola, who <lb/>
            was honoured with this name by the Romans, his original <lb/>
            name having been Publius Valerius, a supposed descendant <lb/>
            of that Valerius who in ancient times was especially <lb/>
            instrumental in making the Romans and Sabines cease to <lb/>
            be enemies and become one people; for it was he who <lb/>
            persuaded the two kings to meet and make terms of peace. <lb/>
            Valerius, a descendant of this hero, was a man of eminence <lb/>
            in Rome, which was then ruled by the kings, because of <lb/>
            his eloquence and wealth. He always spoke boldly on <lb/>
            the side of justice, and assisted the poor and needy with <lb/>
            such kindness that it was clear that, in case of a revolution, <lb/>
            he would become the first man in the state.</p>
          <p>Tarquinius Superbus, the king, had not come to his <lb/>
            throne justly, but by wicked and lawless violence, and as <lb/>
            he reigned tyrannically and insolently, the people hated <lb/>
            him, and seized the opportunity of the death of Lucretia, <lb/>
            after her dishonour, to drive him out. Lucius Brutus, <lb/>
            who was determined to change the form of government, <lb/>
            applied to Valerius first of all, and with his vigorous <lb/>
            assistance drove out the king. After these events <lb/>
            Valerius kept quiet, as long as it seemed likely that the <lb/>
            people would choose a single general to replace their <lb/>
            king, because he thought that it was Brutus's right to be <lb/>
            elected, as he had been the leader of the revolution. How­ <lb/>
            ever the people, disgusted with the idea of monarchy, and <lb/>
            thinking that they could more easily endure to be ruled <lb/>
            by two men, proposed that two consuls should be chosen. <lb/>
            Valerius now became a candidate, hoping that he and <lb/>
            Brutus would be elected ; but he was not chosen. Brutus, <lb/>
            instead of Valerius, whom he would have preferred, had as <lb/>
            a colleague Tarquinius Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia, <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            who was not a better man than Valerius, but was elected <lb/>
            because the men in power at Rome, seeing what intrigues <lb/>
            the exiled king was setting on foot to secure his return, <lb/>
            wished to have for their general a man who was his sworn <lb/>
            personal enemy.</p>
          <p>II. Valerius, disgusted at the idea that he was not <lb/>
            trusted to fight for his country because he had not suffered <lb/>
            any personal wrong at the hands of the king, left the <lb/>
            senate, refused to attend public meetings, and ceased to <lb/>
            take any part whatever in public affairs, so that people <lb/>
            began to fear that in his rage he might go over to the <lb/>
            king's party and destroy the tottering edifice of Roman <lb/>
            liberty. Brutus suspected some others besides him, and <lb/>
            proposed on a certain day to hold a solemn sacrifice and <lb/>
            bind the senate by an oath. Valerius, however, camo <lb/>
            cheerfully into the Forum, and was the first to swear <lb/>
            that he would never yield anything to the Tarquins, but <lb/>
            would fight for liberty to the death, by which he greatly <lb/>
            delighted the senate and encouraged the leading men of <lb/>
            the state. His acts too, immediately confirmed his words, <lb/>
            for ambassadors came from Tarquin with specious and <lb/>
            seductive proposals, such as he thought would win over <lb/>
            the people, coming from a king who seemed to have laid <lb/>
            aside his insolence and only to wish for his just rights. <lb/>
            The consuls thought it right that these proposals should <lb/>
            be laid before the people, but Valerius would not permit <lb/>
            it, not wishing that the poorer citizens, to whom the war <lb/>
            was a greater burden than the monarchy had been, should <lb/>
            have any excuse for revolt.</p>
          <p>III. After this came other ambassadors, announcing <lb/>
            that Tarquin would give up his throne, put an end to the <lb/>
            war, and only ask for his own property and that of his <lb/>
            relatives and friends, upon which to live in exile. Many <lb/>
            were inclined to agree to this, and amongst them Col­ <lb/>
            latinus, when Brutus, an inflexible and harsh-tempered <lb/>
            man, rushed into the Forum, calling out that his colleague <lb/>
            was a traitor, who wished to furnish the tyrant with the <lb/>
            means of continuing the war and recovering his throne, <lb/>
            when he ought rather to grudge him food to keep <lb/>
            him from starving. The citizens assembled, and Caius <lb/>
            Minucius, a private citizen, was the first man who ad­ <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            dressed them, encouraging Brutus, and pointing out to <lb/>
            the Romans how much better it was that the money should <lb/>
            be used to help them than to help their enemies. In spite <lb/>
            of this, however, the Romans decided that, as they now <lb/>
            possessed the liberty for which they had fought, they <lb/>
            would not lose the additional blessing of peace for the sake <lb/>
            of this property, but would cast it from them after the <lb/>
            tyrant to which it belonged.</p>
          <p>Tarquin really cared little for the property, and the <lb/>
            demand was merely made in order to sound the people and <lb/>
            arrange a plot for the betrayal of the state, which was <lb/>
            managed by the ambassadors whom he had nominally sent <lb/>
            to look after his property. These men were selling some <lb/>
            part of it, keeping some safe, and sending some of it away, <lb/>
            and meanwhile intrigued so successfully that they won <lb/>
            over two of the best families in Rome, that of the Aquillii, <lb/>
            in which were three senators, and that of the Vitellii, <lb/>
            among whom were two. All these men were, on the <lb/>
            mother's side, nephews of the consul Collatinus, and the <lb/>
            Vitellii were also related to Brutus, for he had married <lb/>
            their sister, and by her had a large family. The Vitellii, <lb/>
            being relatives and intimate friends of the two elder sons <lb/>
            of Brutus, induced them to take part in the conspiracy, <lb/>
            holding out to them the hope that they might ally them­ <lb/>
            selves to the great house of Tarquin, soon to be restored to <lb/>
            the throne, and would rid themselves of their father's <lb/>
            stupidity and harshness. By harshness, they alluded to <lb/>
            his inexorable punishment of bad men, and the stupidity <lb/>
            was that which he himself affected for a long time, in <lb/>
            order to conceal his real character from the tyrant, which <lb/>
            was made matter of reproach to him afterwards.</p>
          <p>IV. So, after they had persuaded these young men, they <lb/>
            conferred again with the Aquillii, and determined that all <lb/>
            the conspirators should swear a great and terrible oath, in <lb/>
            which a man is killed, and each person then pours a <lb/>
            libation of his blood, and touches his entrails. The room <lb/>
            in which they meant to do this was, as may be supposed, <lb/>
            a dark and half-ruined one. Now a servant of the name <lb/>
            of Vindicius happened to conceal himself in it; not that he <lb/>
            had any designs or any knowledge of what was going on, <lb/>
            but chancing to be in the room when the conspirators <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            solemnly entered, he was afraid of being detected there, and <lb/>
            so hid himself behind a chest, where he could see what <lb/>
            was done and hear what was said by them. They agreed <lb/>
            to assassinate both consuls, and wrote a letter to Tarquin <lb/>
            acquainting him with their determination, which they <lb/>
            gave to the ambassadors, who were lodging in the house <lb/>
            of the Aquillii as their guests, and were present at this <lb/>
            scene. After this they dispersed, and Vindicius came out <lb/>
            from his hiding-place. He was at a loss what use to <lb/>
            make of the discovery which Fortune had thrown in his <lb/>
            way, for he thought it a shocking thing, as indeed it was, <lb/>
            for him to make such a fearful revelation to Brutus about <lb/>
            his sons, or to Collatinus about his nephews, and he would <lb/>
            not trust any private citizen with a secret of such impor­ <lb/>
            tance. Tormented by his secret, and unable to remain <lb/>
            quiet, he addressed himself to Valerius, chiefly moved to <lb/>
            do so by his affable kindly temper; for his house was <lb/>
            open all day to those who wished to speak with him, and <lb/>
            he never refused an interview or rejected a poor man's <lb/>
            petition.</p>
          <p>V. When, then, Vindicius came before him and told him <lb/>
            all that he knew in the presence only of his wife and his <lb/>
            brother Marcus, Valerius was astounded and horrified. He <lb/>
            would not let the man go, but locked him up, set his wife <lb/>
            to guard the door, and bade his brother to surround the <lb/>
            king's quarters, to seize the letter, if possible, keeping <lb/>
            a strict watch over all the servants there. He himself, <lb/>
            with a large train of clients friends and servants, went to <lb/>
            the house of the Aquillii, who were not within. As no <lb/>
            one expected him, he pushed into the house and found <lb/>
            the letter lying in the ambassadors' apartments.</p>
          <p>While he was thus employed, the Aquillii returned in <lb/>
            haste, and assembling a force at the door endeavoured to <lb/>
            take away the letter from him. His own party came to <lb/>
            his assistance, and with their gowns twisted round their <lb/>
            necks with much buffeting made their way to the Forum. <lb/>
            The same thing happened at the king's quarters, where <lb/>
            Marcus laid hold of another letter which was being taken <lb/>
            thither concealed among some baggage, and brought as <lb/>
            many of the king's party as he could into the Forum.</p>
          <p>VI. When the consuls had put a stop to the confusion, <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            Vindicius, at Valerius's command, was brought out of his <lb/>
            prison, and a court was held. The letters were recognised, <lb/>
            and the culprits had nothing to say for themselves. All <lb/>
            were silent and downcast, and a few, thinking to please <lb/>
            Brutus, hinted at banishment as the penalty of their crime. <lb/>
            Collatinus by his tears, and Valerius by his silence gave <lb/>
            them hopes of mercy. But Brutus, addressing each of his <lb/>
            sons by name, said, “ Come, Titus, come Tiberius, why do <lb/>
            you make no answer to the charges against you?" As, <lb/>
            after being asked thrice, they made no answer, he, turning <lb/>
            his face to the lictors, said, " I have done my work, do <lb/>
            yours." They immediately seized upon the young men, <lb/>
            tore off their clothes, tied their hands behind their backs, <lb/>
            and scourged them. Although the people had not the <lb/>
            heart to look at so dreadful a sight, yet it is said that Brutus <lb/>
            never turned away his head, and showed no pity on his <lb/>
            stern countenance, but sat savagely looking on at the <lb/>
            execution of his sons until at last they were laid on the <lb/>
            ground and their heads severed with an axe. Then he <lb/>
            handed over the rest of the culprits to be dealt with by his <lb/>
            colleague, rose, and left the Forum. His conduct cannot <lb/>
            be praised, and yet it is above censure. Either virtue in <lb/>
            his mind overpowered every other feeling, or his sorrow <lb/>
            was so great as to produce insensibility. In neither case <lb/>
            was there anything unworthy, or even human in his <lb/>
            conduct, but it was either that of a god or a brute beast. <lb/>
            It is better, however, that we should speak in praise of so <lb/>
            great a man rather than allow our weakness to distrust his <lb/>
            virtue. Indeed the Romans think that even the foundation <lb/>
            of the city by Romulus was not so great an event as the <lb/>
            confirmation of its constitution by Brutus.</p>
          <p>VII. When he left the Forum all men were silent for a <lb/>
            long while, shuddering at what had been done. The <lb/>
            Aquillii took heart at the mildness of Collatinus, and asked <lb/>
            for time to prepare their defence. They also begged that <lb/>
            Vindicius might be given up to them, because he was their <lb/>
            servant, and ought not to be on the side of their accusers. <lb/>
            Collatinus was willing to allow this, but Valerius said that <lb/>
            he was not able to give the man up, because he was sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by so large a crowd, and called upon the people <lb/>
            not to disperse without punishing the traitors. At last he <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            laid his hands upon the two corpses, called for Brutus, and <lb/>
            reproached Collatinus for making his colleague act against <lb/>
            nature by condemning his own sons to death, and then <lb/>
            thinking to please the wives of these traitors and public <lb/>
            enemies by saving tkeir lives. The consul, vexed at this, <lb/>
            ordered the lictors to seize Vindicius. They forced their <lb/>
            way through the crowd, tried to lay hold of him, and <lb/>
            struck those who defended him, but the friends of Valerius <lb/>
            stood in front of him and beat them off, and the people <lb/>
            raised a shout for Brutus. He returned, and when silence <lb/>
            was restored said that he had, as a father, full power to <lb/>
            condemn his sons to death, but that as for the other culprits, <lb/>
            their fate should be decided by the free vote of the citizens, <lb/>
            and that any one might come forward and address the <lb/>
            people. The people, however, would listen to no speeches, <lb/>
            but voted unanimously for their death, and they were <lb/>
            all beheaded.</p>
          <p>Collatinus, it seems, had been viewed with suspicion <lb/>
            before because of his connection with the royal family, and <lb/>
            his second name, Tarquinius, was odious to the people. <lb/>
            After these events, having utterly failed as consul, he <lb/>
            voluntarily laid down that office, and left the city. So <lb/>
            now there was another election, and Valerius received the <lb/>
            due reward of his patriotism and was gloriously made consul. <lb/>
            Thinking that Vindicius ought to receive something for <lb/>
            his services, he made him a freedman, the first ever made <lb/>
            in Rome, and allowed him to vote in whatever tribe he <lb/>
            chose to be enrolled. The other freedmen were not allowed <lb/>
            the suffrage till, long after, it was given them by Appius <lb/>
            to obtain popularity among them. The whole ceremony <lb/>
            is up to the present day called vindicta, after Vindicius, we <lb/>
            are told.</p>
          <p>'TII. After this they allowed the king's property to be <lb/>
            plundered, and destroyed the palace. Tarquinius had <lb/>
            obtained the pleasantest part of the Field of Mars, and had <lb/>
            consecrated it to that god. This field had just been cut, <lb/>
            and the corn lay on the ground, for the people thought <lb/>
            that they must not thresh it or make any use of it, because <lb/>
            of the ground being consecrated, so they took the sheaves <lb/>
            and threw them into the river. In the same way they cut <lb/>
            down the trees and threw them in, leaving the whole place <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            for the god, but uncultivated and unfruitful. As there <lb/>
            were many things of different sorts all floating together in <lb/>
            the river, the current did not carry them far, but when the <lb/>
            first masses settled on a shallow place, the rest which were <lb/>
            carried down upon them could not get past, but became <lb/>
            heaped up there, and the stream compacted them securely <lb/>
            by the mud which it deposited upon them, not only increas­ <lb/>
            ing the size of the whole mass, but firmly cementing it <lb/>
            together. The waves did not shake it, but gently beat it <lb/>
            into a solid consistency. Now, from its size, it began to <lb/>
            receive additions, as most of what the river brought down <lb/>
            settled upon it. It is now a sacred island close by the <lb/>
            city, with temples and walks, and in the Latin tongue it <lb/>
            has a name which means " between two bridges." Some <lb/>
            state that this did not happen when Tarquinia's field was <lb/>
            consecrated, but in later times when Tarquinia gave up <lb/>
            another field next to that one, for the public use. This <lb/>
            Tarquinia was a priestess, one of the Vestal virgins, and <lb/>
            she was greatly honoured for having done so, and was <lb/>
            allowed to appear as a witness in court, which no other <lb/>
            woman could do; she also was permitted to marry, by a <lb/>
            decree of the senate, but did not avail herself of it. <lb/>
            These are the legends which they tell about this island.</p>
          <p>IX. Tarquin now gave up all hopes of recovering his <lb/>
            throne by intrigue, and appealed to the Etruscans, who <lb/>
            willingly espoused his cause and endeavoured to restore <lb/>
            him with a great army. The consuls led out the Romans <lb/>
            to fight against them, posting them in holy places one of <lb/>
            which is called the Arsian grove, and another the iEsuvian <lb/>
            meadow. When they were about to join battle, Aruns, <lb/>
            the son of Tarquin, and Brutus, the Roman consul, attacked <lb/>
            one another, not by chance, but with fell hatred and rage, <lb/>
            the one urging his horse against the tyrant and enemy of <lb/>
            his country, the other against the man who drove him <lb/>
            into exile. Falling upon one another with more fury <lb/>
            than judgment, they made no attempt to defend themselves, <lb/>
            but only to strike, and both perished. The struggle, so <lb/>
            terribly begun, was continued with equal ferocity on both <lb/>
            sides, until the armies, after great losses, were separated <lb/>
            by a tempest. Valerius, was in great straits, not know­ <lb/>
            ing how the battle had gone, and observing that his <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            soldiers were despondent when they looked at the corpses <lb/>
            of their comrades, and elated when they saw those of the <lb/>
            enemy, so equal and undecided had been the slaughter. <lb/>
            Yet each side, when it viewed its own dead close by, was <lb/>
            more inclined to own itself defeated, than to claim the <lb/>
            victory because of the supposed losses of the enemy. <lb/>
            Night came on, and it was spent as may be imagined by <lb/>
            men who had fought so hard. When all was quiet in <lb/>
            both camps, we are told that the grove was shaken, and <lb/>
            that from it proceeded a loud voice which declared that <lb/>
            the Etruscans had lost one man more than the Romans. <lb/>
            Apparently it was the voice of a god; for immediately <lb/>
            the Romans raised a bold and joyous shout, and the <lb/>
            Etruscans, panic-stricken, ran out of their camp and dis­ <lb/>
            persed. The Romans attacked the camp, took prisoners <lb/>
            all that were left in it, something less than five thousand, <lb/>
            and plundered it. The dead, when counted, proved to be <lb/>
            eleven thousand three hundred of the enemy, and of the <lb/>
            Romans the same number save one. This battle is said <lb/>
            to have been fought on the Calends of March. Valerius <lb/>
            triumphed after it in a four-horse chariot, being the first <lb/>
            consul that ever did so. And it was a magnificent sight, <lb/>
            and did not, as some say, ofiend the spectators; for, if so, <lb/>
            the habit of doing it would not have been so carefully <lb/>
            kept up for so many years. The people were also pleased <lb/>
            with the honours which Valerius paid to his colleague in <lb/>
            arranging a splended funeral for him; he also pronounced <lb/>
            a funeral oration over him, which was so much approved <lb/>
            of by the Romans that from that day forth it became the <lb/>
            custom for all good and great men at their deaths to have <lb/>
            an oration made over them by the leading men of the <lb/>
            time. This is said to have been older even than the <lb/>
            Greek funeral orations, unless, as Anaximenes tells us, <lb/>
            Solon introduced this custom.</p>
          <p>X. But the people were vexed and angry, because <lb/>
            though Brutus, whom they thought the author of their <lb/>
            liberty, would not be consul alone, but had one colleague <lb/>
            ufter another, yet " Valerius," they said, “ has got all power <lb/>
            into his own hands, and is not so much the heir of the <lb/>
            consulship of Brutus as of the tyranny of Tarquin. And <lb/>
            what use is it for him to praise Brutus while he imitates <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            Tarquin in his deeds, swaggering down into the Forum <lb/>
            with all the rods and axes before him, from a house larger <lb/>
            than the king's palace used to be." Indeed, Valerius <lb/>
            lived in rather too splendid a house on the Velian Hill, <lb/>
            looking down into the Forum, and difficult to climb up to, <lb/>
            so that when he walked down from it he did indeed look <lb/>
            like a tragedy king leaving his palace. But now he <lb/>
            proved how valuable a thing it is for a statesman engaged <lb/>
            in important matters to keep his ears open to the truth, <lb/>
            and shut against flattery. Hearing from his friends what <lb/>
            the people thought of him, he did not argue or grieve at <lb/>
            it, but suddenly assembled a number of workmen and <lb/>
            during the night destroyed his entire house down to the <lb/>
            very foundations, so that on the next day the Romans <lb/>
            collected in crowds to see it, admiring the magnanimity <lb/>
            of the man, but sorrowing at the destruction of so great <lb/>
            and noble a house, which, like many a man, had been put <lb/>
            to death undeservedly, and expressing their concern for <lb/>
            their consul, who had no house to live in. Valerius, <lb/>
            indeed, had to be entertained by his friends, until the <lb/>
            people gave him a site and built him a house upon it, of <lb/>
            more moderate proportions than the other, in the place where <lb/>
            at the present day stands the temple of Vica Pota. Wish­ <lb/>
            ing to make not only himself but his office cease to be an <lb/>
            object of terror to his countrymen, he removed the axes <lb/>
            from the bundles of rods carried by the lictors, and when <lb/>
            he entered the assembly of the people he ordered his fasces <lb/>
            to be bowed and lowered before them, to show respect to <lb/>
            the majesty of the people. This custom the consuls <lb/>
            observe to this day. By these acts he did not really <lb/>
            humble himself as he appeared to the Romans to be doing, <lb/>
            but he so completely destroyed any illwill which had been <lb/>
            felt against him that by giving up the semblance of power <lb/>
            he really gained the reality, as the people were eager <lb/>
            to serve him and obey him. For this reason they sur­ <lb/>
            named him Poplicola, which means " lover of the people," <lb/>
            and this name so took the place of his former one that we <lb/>
            shall use it during the remainder of this account of his life.</p>
          <p>XI. He permitted any one to become a candidate for <lb/>
            the consulship; and while he was sole consul he used his <lb/>
            power to effect the greatest of his reforms, because he did <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            not know who his new colleague might be, and whether <lb/>
            he would not thwart him through ignorance or illwill. <lb/>
            First of all he brought up the senate to its proper number, <lb/>
            for many senators had perished, some at Tarquin's hands <lb/>
            in former years, and some in the late battle. It is said <lb/>
            that he elected no less than a hundred and sixty-four new <lb/>
            senators. After this, he enacted laws which greatly <lb/>
            added to the power of the people, the first one of which <lb/>
            gave accused persons a power of appeal from the decision <lb/>
            of the consuls to the people. The second appointed <lb/>
            the penalty of death to those who entered upon any <lb/>
            public office without the consent of the people. The <lb/>
            third was to assist the poor, as it relieved them from <lb/>
            taxes and enabled them all to apply themselves with <lb/>
            greater assiduity to trade. The law, too, which he en­ <lb/>
            acted about disobedience to the consuls is no less popular <lb/>
            in its spirit, and favours the people more than the great <lb/>
            nobles. He assessed the fine for disobedience at the price <lb/>
            of five oxen and two sheep. Now the value of a sheep <lb/>
            was ten obols, and that of an ox a hundred, for at this <lb/>
            period the Romans did not make much use of coined <lb/>
            money, but possessed abundance of cattle. For this <lb/>
            reason at this day they call property peculia, from pecus, <lb/>
            a sheep, and on their oldest coins they marked the figure <lb/>
            of an ox, a sheep, or a pig. Their children, too, were <lb/>
            distinguished by the names of Suillii, Bubulci, Caprarii <lb/>
            and Porcii, for capra means a goat, and porcus a pig.</p>
          <p>XII. Though Poplicola favoured the people so much in <lb/>
            these laws, and showed such great moderation, yet in one <lb/>
            instance he appointed a terrible penalty. One of his laws <lb/>
            enacted that any citizen was at liberty to put to death <lb/>
            anyone who tried to mal-e himself king, without any form <lb/>
            of trial. No penalty was to be enforced, if the mail could <lb/>
            bring forward proofs of the other's intention. His reason <lb/>
            for this was that it was impossible for any one to attempt <lb/>
            to make himself king, unperceived by some of his country­ <lb/>
            men, but quite possible for him, although detected, to <lb/>
            become too powerful to be brought to trial. So, before he <lb/>
            made his attempt on the crown, any one was at liberty to <lb/>
            exact from him that penalty, which he would be unable <lb/>
            to do after his success.</p><pb n="171"/>
            
          <p>His law about the treasury was also much approved. <lb/>
            It being necessary that the citizens should contribute <lb/>
            taxes to carry on the war, as he did not wish to touch the <lb/>
            revenue himself or to allow his friends to do so, and was <lb/>
            even unwilling that the public money should be brought <lb/>
            into a private man's house, he appointed the Temple of <lb/>
            Saturn to be used as a treasury, which it is to this day, <lb/>
            and he appointed also two of the younger citizens as <lb/>
            quæstors, to manage the accounts. The first quæstors <lb/>
            were Publius Venturius and Marcus Minucius, and a large <lb/>
            sum of money was collected, for a hundred and thirty <lb/>
            thousand persons were taxed, although orphans and <lb/>
            widows were exempted.</p>
          <p>When he had settled all these matters, he nominated <lb/>
            Lucretius, the father of Lucretia, as his colleague, and <lb/>
            gave up the fasces to him as a mark of respect, because he <lb/>
            was the elder man. This custom, that the elder of the <lb/>
            two consuls has the fasces carried before him, remains to this <lb/>
            day. As Lucretius died shortly afterwards, a new election <lb/>
            took place, and Marcus Horatius was elected, and acted as <lb/>
            Poplicola's colleague for the remainder of his year of office.</p>
          <p>XIII. As Tarquin was stirring up the Etruscans to a <lb/>
            second war with Rome, a great portent is said to have <lb/>
            taken place. While he was yet king, and had all but <lb/>
            finished the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, he, either <lb/>
            in accordance with some prophecy or otherwise, ordered <lb/>
            certain Etruscan workmen at Veil to make an earthen­ <lb/>
            ware four-horse chariot to be placed on the top of the <lb/>
            temple. Shortly afterwards he was driven from the <lb/>
            throne, and the chariot, which had been modelled in clay, <lb/>
            was placed in the furnace. Here it did not, as clay <lb/>
            generally does, shrink and become smaller in the fire, as <lb/>
            the wet dries out of it, but swelled to so great a size, and <lb/>
            became so hard and strong that it could only be got out of <lb/>
            the furnace by taking off the roof and sides. As this was <lb/>
            decided by the prophets to be a sign from Heaven that <lb/>
            those who possessed the chariot would be prosperous and <lb/>
            fortunate, the Veientines determined not to give it up to <lb/>
            the Romans, arguing that it belonged to Tarquin, not to <lb/>
            those who had cast him out.</p>
          <p>A few days afterwards there were horse-races there; <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            everything proceeded as usual, but as the driver of the <lb/>
            winning chariot, after receiving his crown as victor, was <lb/>
            driving slowly out of the circus, the horses suddenly <lb/>
            became excited for no apparent cause, and, either guided <lb/>
            by Heaven or by chance, rushed towards Rome, their <lb/>
            driver with them, for he finding it impossible to stop them <lb/>
            was forced to let them whirl him along until they reached <lb/>
            the Capitol, where they threw him down near what is <lb/>
            called the Ratumenan Gate. The Veientines, struck with <lb/>
            fear and wonder at this event, permitted the workmen to <lb/>
            deliver up the earthenware chariot to the Romans.</p>
          <p>XIV. Tarquinius the son of Demaratus, when at war <lb/>
            with the Sabines, vowed that he would build the temple <lb/>
            of Jupiter Olympius, but it was built by Tarquinius <lb/>
            Superbus, the son or grandson of him who made the vow. <lb/>
            He had not time to dedicate it, but was dethroned just <lb/>
            before its completion. Now when it was finished and <lb/>
            thoroughly decorated, Poplicola was eager to have the <lb/>
            glory of dedicating it. Many of the nobles, however, <lb/>
            grudged him this, and were more incensed at this than <lb/>
            at all the glory which he had won as a general and as a <lb/>
            legislator ; for that, they said, was his vocation, but this was <lb/>
            not. They stirred up Horatius to oppose him and urged <lb/>
            him to claim the right to dedicate the temple. So when <lb/>
            Poplicola was of necessity absent on military service, the <lb/>
            senate decreed that Horatius should dedicate it, and <lb/>
            brought him up into the Capitol to do so, a thing which <lb/>
            they never could have done had Poplicola been present. <lb/>
            Some say that the two consuls casts lots, and that the one, <lb/>
            sorely against his will, drew the lot to command the army <lb/>
            in the field, and the other that to dedicate the temple. <lb/>
            But we may conjecture how this was, from the events <lb/>
            which took place at the dedication. On the Ides of <lb/>
            September, which corresponds with the full moon in our <lb/>
            month Metageitnion, all the people assembled in the <lb/>
            Capitol, and Horatius, after silence had been enjoined upon <lb/>
            all, performed the ceremony of dedication. When, as is <lb/>
            customary, he was about to take hold of the doors of the <lb/>
            temple and say the prayer of dedication, Marcus, Poplicola's <lb/>
            brother, who had long been standing near the doors <lb/>
            watching his opportunity, said to him, " Consul, your son <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            has just died of sickness in the camp." All who heard <lb/>
            this were grieved, but Horatius, undisturbed, merely said, <lb/>
            " Fling his corpse where you please, for I cannot grieve <lb/>
            for him," and completed the dedication service. The story <lb/>
            was false, invented by Marcus to confuse Horatius. His <lb/>
            conduct is a remarkable instance of presence of mind, <lb/>
            whether it be that he at once saw through the trick, or <lb/>
            believed the story and was not disturbed by it.</p>
          <p>XV. The same fortune seems to have attended the <lb/>
            second temple also. The first, as we have related, was <lb/>
            built by Tarquin, and dedicated by Horatius. This <lb/>
            was destroyed by fire in the civil wars. The second was <lb/>
            built by Sulla, but the name of Catulus appears as its <lb/>
            dedicator, for Sulla died before it was completed. This <lb/>
            again was burned during the civil tumults in the time of <lb/>
            Vitellius, and Vespasian built a third, which had nearly <lb/>
            the same fortune as the others, except that he saw it <lb/>
            completed, and did not see it shortly afterwards destroyed, <lb/>
            being thus more fortunate than Tarquin in seeing the <lb/>
            completion, and than Sulla in seeing the dedication of his <lb/>
            work. When Vespasian died the Capitol was burned. <lb/>
            The fourth and present temple was built and dedicated <lb/>
            by Domitian. It is said that Tarquin spent forty thou­ <lb/>
            sand pounds of silver in building the foundations; but <lb/>
            there is no private citizen in Rome at the present day <lb/>
            who could bear the expense of gilding the existing temple, <lb/>
            which cost more than twelve thousand talents. Its <lb/>
            columns are of Pentelic marble, exquisitely proportioned, <lb/>
            which I myself saw at Athens; but at Rome they were <lb/>
            again cut and polished, by which process they did not <lb/>
            gain so much in gloss as they lost in symmetry, for they <lb/>
            now appear too slender. However, if any one who <lb/>
            wonders at the expense of the temple in the Capitol were <lb/>
            to see the splendour of any one portico, hall, or chamber <lb/>
            in the house of Domitian, he would certainly be led to <lb/>
            parody that line of Epicharmus upon an extravagant <lb/>
            fellow, <lb/>
            "Not good-natured, but possessed with the disease of giving," <lb/>
            and would say that Domitian was not pious or admirable, <lb/>
            but possessed with the disease of building, and turned <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            everything into bricks and mortar, just as it is said Midas <lb/>
            turned things into gold. So much for this.</p>
          <p>XVI. Tarquin, after the great battle in which his son <lb/>
            was slain by Brutus, took refuge at Clusium and begged <lb/>
            Lars Porsena, the most powerful king in Italy, to assist <lb/>
            him. He was thought to be an honourable and ambitious <lb/>
            man, and promised his aid. First he sent an embassy <lb/>
            to Rome, ordering them to receive Tarquin; and when <lb/>
            the Romans refused to obey, he declared war against them, <lb/>
            and telling them at what place and time he would attack <lb/>
            them, marched against them with a great army. At <lb/>
            Rome, Poplicola, though absent, was chosen consul for the <lb/>
            second time, and with him, Titus Lucretius. He returned <lb/>
            to Rome, and by way of putting a slight upon Porsena, <lb/>
            went and founded the city of Sigliuria, while his army was <lb/>
            close at hand. He built the walls of this place at a vast <lb/>
            expense, and sent away seven hundred colonists to it, as <lb/>
            if the war with which he was menaced was a very unim­ <lb/>
            portant matter. But, nevertheless, Porsena made a sharp <lb/>
            assault upon the walls of Rome, drove away the garrison, <lb/>
            and very nearly entered the town. Poplicola forestalled <lb/>
            him by sallying from one of the gates, and fought by the <lb/>
            banks of the Tiber against overwhelming numbers until he <lb/>
            was severely wounded and had to be carried out of the <lb/>
            battle. As the same fate befell his colleague Lucretius, <lb/>
            the Romans lost heart and endeavoured to save themselves <lb/>
            by flight into the town. As the enemy also began to <lb/>
            push across the wooden bridge, Rome was in danger of <lb/>
            being taken. But Horatius, surnamed Codes, and with <lb/>
            him two of the noblest citizens, named Herminius and <lb/>
            Lartius, held the wooden bridge against them. This <lb/>
            Horatius was surnamed Codes because he had lost an eye <lb/>
            in the wars, or as some say because of the flatness of his <lb/>
            nose, which made his eyes and eyebrows seem to meet, <lb/>
            having nothing to separate them, and therefore the people <lb/>
            meaning to call him Cyclops, by a mistake of pronuncia­ <lb/>
            tion, named him Codes. This man stood at the end of the <lb/>
            bridge and kept off the enemy until his friends behind <lb/>
            had cut down the bridge. Then he plunged into the <lb/>
            river in his armour and swam to the other bank, though <lb/>
            wounded by an Etruscan spear in the thigh. Poplicola, <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            in admiration of his valour, at once proposed and passed <lb/>
            a decree that every Roman should give him the price of <lb/>
            one day's provisions. Moreover, he gave him as much <lb/>
            land as he could plough in one day. And a brazen statue <lb/>
            of him was placed in the temple of Vulcan, by which <lb/>
            honourable allusion was made to the lameness caused by <lb/>
            his wound.</p>
          <p>XVII. As Porsena pressed the siege, the Romans <lb/>
            suffered from famine, and another separate army of <lb/>
            Etruscans invaded their territory. But Poplicola, who <lb/>
            was now consul for the third time, though he thought it <lb/>
            his chief duty to remain stedfast and hold out the city <lb/>
            against Porsena, did nevertheless sally out and attack <lb/>
            these men, routing them with a loss of five thousand. <lb/>
            Now as to the legend of Mucius, it is told in many <lb/>
            different ways, but I will relate it as it seems most <lb/>
            probable that it happened. He was a man of great <lb/>
            courage, and very daring in war, who, meaning to assassi­ <lb/>
            nate Porsena, stole into the camp in an Etruscan dress <lb/>
            and speaking the Etruscan language. When he arrived <lb/>
            at the raised platform on which the king was sitting, he <lb/>
            did not exactly know which was he, and being afraid to <lb/>
            ask, he drew his sword and killed the man who of all the <lb/>
            party looked most as if he were the king. Hereupon, he <lb/>
            was seized and questioned. A fire was burning close by <lb/>
            in a brazier which had been brought for Porsena to offer <lb/>
            sacrifice. Mucius held his right hand over this, and while <lb/>
            the flesh was being consumed looked at Porsena cheerfully <lb/>
            and calmly, until he in astonishment acquitted him and <lb/>
            restored him his sword, which Mucius took with his left <lb/>
            hand. On account of this he is said to have been named <lb/>
            Scœvola, which means left-handed. He then said that <lb/>
            though he did not fear Porsena, he was conquered by his <lb/>
            generosity, and out of kindness would tell him what <lb/>
            torture would have failed to extort: “ Three hundred <lb/>
            young Romans like-minded with myself are at present <lb/>
            concealed in your camp. I was chosen by lot to make <lb/>
            the first attempt, and am not grieved that I failed to kill <lb/>
            a man of honour, who ought to be a friend rather than an <lb/>
            enemy to the Romans.” Porsena, hearing this, believed <lb/>
            it to be true, and became much more inclined to make <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            peace, not, I imagine, so much for fear of the three hundred, <lb/>
            as out of admiration for the spirit and valour of the <lb/>
            Romans. This Mucius is called Scaevola by all writers, <lb/>
            but Athenodorus, the son of Sandon, in his book which is <lb/>
            dedicated to Octavia, the sister of Cæsar Augustus, says <lb/>
            that he was also named Posthumus.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Poplicola, who did not think Porsena so terrible <lb/>
            as an enemy as he would be valuable as a friend and ally, <lb/>
            was willing that he should decide the quarrel between <lb/>
            the Romans and Tarquin, and often proposed that he <lb/>
            should do so, feeling sure that he would discover him to <lb/>
            be a wretch who had been most deservedly dethroned. <lb/>
            But Tarquin roughly answered that he would submit his <lb/>
            claims to no judge, and least of all to Porsena, who had <lb/>
            been his ally and now seemed inclined to desert him. <lb/>
            Porsena was angered at this, and, as his son Aruns also <lb/>
            pleaded hard for the Romans, put an end to the war upon <lb/>
            condition that they should give up the portion of Etruscan <lb/>
            territory which they had seized, restore their prisoners, <lb/>
            and receive back their deserters. Upon this, ten youths <lb/>
            of the noblest families were given as hostages, and as <lb/>
            many maidens, among whom was Valeria, the daughter <lb/>
            of Poplicola.</p>
          <p>XIX. \\ hile these negotiations were going on, and <lb/>
            Porsena, through his confidence in the good faith of the <lb/>
            Romans, had relaxed the discipline of his camp, these <lb/>
            Roman maidens came down to bathe in the river at a <lb/>
            place where a bank, in the form of a crescent, makes the <lb/>
            water smooth and undisturbed. As they saw no guards, <lb/>
            nor any one passing except in boats, they determined to <lb/>
            swim across, although the stream was strong and deep. <lb/>
            Some say that one of them, by name Clcelia, rode on a <lb/>
            horse across the river, encouraging the others as they <lb/>
            swam. When they had got safe across they went to <lb/>
            Poplicola, but he was displeased with them because it <lb/>
            made him seem more faithless than Porsena, and he feared <lb/>
            lest this daring feat of the maidens might be suspected of <lb/>
            being a preconcerted plot of the Romans. For these <lb/>
            reasons he sent them back to Porsena. Now Tarquin <lb/>
            and his party, foreseeing that this would be done, laid an <lb/>
            ambush on the further bank and attacked those who were <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            escorting the girls with superior numbers. Still they <lb/>
            made a stout defence, and meanwhile Valeria, the daugh­ <lb/>
            ter of Poplicola, made her way through the combat­ <lb/>
            ants and escaped, and three slaves who also got away <lb/>
            took care of her. The others were mixed up with the <lb/>
            fight, and were in considerable danger, when Aruns, <lb/>
            Porsena's son, came to the rescue, put the enemy to the <lb/>
            rout, and saved the Romans. When the girls were <lb/>
            brought before Porsena, he asked which it was that had <lb/>
            conceived the attempt to escape and encouraged the <lb/>
            others. Being told that it was Clœlia, he smiled kindly <lb/>
            upon her, and presented her with one of his own horses, <lb/>
            splendidly caparisoned. This is relied upon by those who <lb/>
            say that it was Clœlia alone who rode on horseback over <lb/>
            the river, as proving their case. Others say that it was <lb/>
            not because she used a horse, but to honour her manly <lb/>
            spirit that the Etruscan king made her this present. A <lb/>
            statue of her, on horseback, stands in the Sacred Way as <lb/>
            you go up to the Palatine Hill, which by some is said not <lb/>
            to be a statue of Clœlia, but of Valeria.</p>
          <p>Porsena, after making peace with the Romans, among <lb/>
            many other instances of generosity, ordered his army to <lb/>
            carry back nothing but their arms when they retired, <lb/>
            leaving the entrenched camp full of food and property of <lb/>
            every kind for the Romans. For this reason, at the pre­ <lb/>
            sent day, whenever there is a sale of any public property, <lb/>
            especially that which is taken in war, proclamation is <lb/>
            always made, " Porsena's goods for sale," so that the <lb/>
            Romans have never forgotten the kindness which they <lb/>
            received from him. A brazen statue of him used to stand <lb/>
            near the senate house, of plain and oldfashioned work­ <lb/>
            manship.</p>
          <p>XX. After this the Sabines invaded the country. <lb/>
            Marcus Valerius, Poplicola's brother, and Posthumius <lb/>
            Tubertus were then consuls, and Marcus, acting by the <lb/>
            advice of Poplicola, who was present, won two great <lb/>
            battles, in the second of which he slew thirteen thousand <lb/>
            of the enemy without the Romans losing a man. He was <lb/>
            rewarded for this, in addition to his triumph, by having a <lb/>
            house built for him upon the Palatine Hill at the public <lb/>
            expense. And whereas all other street doors open inwards, <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            the doors of that house were made to open outwards, as a <lb/>
            perpetual memorial of the honour paid him by the people, <lb/>
            who thus made way for him. It is said that all the doors <lb/>
            in Greece used once to open this way, arguing from the <lb/>
            comedies, in which those who are coming out of a house <lb/>
            always knock at the door, to warn those who are passing <lb/>
            or standing near not to be struck by the leaves of the <lb/>
            door as they open.</p>
          <p>XXI. Next year Poplicola was consul for the fourth time. <lb/>
            There was an expectation of a war against the Latins and <lb/>
            Sabines combined.</p>
          <p>Moreover the city seemed to have displeased the gods; <lb/>
            for all the pregnant women were delivered prematurely, and <lb/>
            of imperfectly formed children. Poplicola, after appeasing <lb/>
            the gods below according to the injunctions of the Sibylline <lb/>
            books, re-established certain games in accordance with an <lb/>
            oracle, brought the city into a more hopeful state of mind, <lb/>
            and began to consider what he had to fear from earthly <lb/>
            foes, for the enemy's army was large and formidable. <lb/>
            There was one Appius Clausus, a Sabine, of great wealth <lb/>
            and remarkable personal strength, and a virtuous and <lb/>
            eloquent man, who, like all great men, was the object of <lb/>
            envy and ill-will to many. He was accused by his <lb/>
            enemies of having put an end to the war, because he <lb/>
            wished to increase the power of Rome, in order to enable <lb/>
            him the more easily to triumph over the liberties of his <lb/>
            own country, and make himself king of it. Perceiving that <lb/>
            the populace eagerly listened to these tales, and that he <lb/>
            was an object of dislike to the war party and the army, <lb/>
            he began to fear impeachment: so, having numerous <lb/>
            followers, besides his personal friends and relatives, he was <lb/>
            able to divide the state into two parties. This caused <lb/>
            great delay in the Sabines' preparations for attacking the <lb/>
            Romans, and Poplicola, feeling it to be his duty not merely <lb/>
            to watch but to assist Clausus, sent envoys, who spoke to <lb/>
            him as follows: " Poplicola feels that you are a man of <lb/>
            honour, who would be unwilling to take vengeance upon <lb/>
            your countrymen, although you have been shamefully <lb/>
            treated by them. But if you choose to put yourself in <lb/>
            safety by leaving your country and a people that hates <lb/>
            you, he will receive you, both in his public and his private <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            capacity, in a manner worthy of your own high character <lb/>
            and of the dignity of Rome." After much deliberation, <lb/>
            Clausus decided that he could not do better than accept this <lb/>
            offer, and assembled all his friends. They in their turn <lb/>
            influenced many others, so that he was able to transplant <lb/>
            to Rome five thousand of the most peaceful and respectable <lb/>
            families of the Sabine nation. Poplicola, who had notice of <lb/>
            their arrival, welcomed them kindly and graciously. He <lb/>
            made them all citizens of Rome, and gave each of them two <lb/>
            acres of land along the river Anio. He gave Clausus <lb/>
            twenty-five acres, and enrolled him among the Senators. <lb/>
            Clausus afterwards became one of the first men in Rome for <lb/>
            wisdom and power, and his descendants, the Claudian <lb/>
            family, was one of the most illustrious in history.</p>
          <p>XXII. Though the disputes of the Sabines were settled <lb/>
            by this migration, yet their popular orators would not let <lb/>
            them rest, but vehemently urged that they ought not to <lb/>
            let Appius, a deserter and an enemy, prevail upon them to <lb/>
            let the Romans go unpunished-a thing which he could not <lb/>
            persuade them to do when he was present among them. <lb/>
            They proceeded to Fidenæ with a great army and en­ <lb/>
            camped there, and laid two thousand men in ambush <lb/>
            before Rome, in wooded and broken ground, meaning in <lb/>
            the morning to send out a few horsemen to plunder <lb/>
            ostentatiously. These men were ordered to ride up close <lb/>
            to Rome, and then to retire till their pursuers were drawn <lb/>
            into the snare. Poplicola heard of this plan the same day <lb/>
            from deserters, and quickly made all necessary arrange­ <lb/>
            ments. At evening he sent Postumius Balbus, his son-in <lb/>
            law, with three thousand men to occupy the tops of the <lb/>
            hills under which the Sabine ambush was placed. His <lb/>
            colleague, Lucretius, was ordered to take the swiftest­ <lb/>
            footed and noblest youth of the city, and pursue the <lb/>
            plundering horsemen, while he himself with the rest of the <lb/>
            forces made a circuitous march and outflanked the enemy. <lb/>
            It chanced that a thick mist came on about dawn, in the <lb/>
            midst of which Postumius charged down from the hills <lb/>
            upon the men in ambush with a loud shout, while <lb/>
            Lucretius sent his men to attack the cavalry, and Poplicola <lb/>
            fell upon the enemy's camp. The Sabines were routed in <lb/>
            every quarter, and even when fighting no longer were <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            cut down by the Romans, their rash confidence proving <lb/>
            ruinous to them. Each party thought that the others <lb/>
            must be safe, and did not care to stay and fight where they <lb/>
            were, but those who were in the camp ran to those in the <lb/>
            ambush, and those in the ambush towards the camp, each <lb/>
            of them meeting those with whom they hoped to take <lb/>
            refuge, and finding that those who they had hoped would <lb/>
            help them needed help themselves. The Sabines would <lb/>
            have been all put to the sword, had not the neighbouring <lb/>
            city of Fidenæ afforded them a refuge, especially for the <lb/>
            men from the camp. Such as could not reach Fidenæ <lb/>
            were either put to death or taken prisoners.</p>
          <p>XXIII. The Romans, accustomed as they are to refer all <lb/>
            great success to the intervention of Heaven, thought that <lb/>
            the whole glory of this achievement was due to the general. <lb/>
            The first thing heard was the victorious soldiers declaring <lb/>
            that Poplicola had delivered up the enemy to them blind <lb/>
            and lame, and all but in chains, for them to slaughter at <lb/>
            their ease. The people were enriched by the plunder and <lb/>
            the sale of the prisoners for slaves. Poplicola enjoyed a <lb/>
            triumph, and previously delivering over the administration <lb/>
            of the city to the two succeeding consuls, died shortly <lb/>
            afterwards, having attained to the highest pitch of glory <lb/>
            that man can reach. The people, as if they had done <lb/>
            nothing during his life to honour him as he deserved, and <lb/>
            were now for the first time to show their gratitude, <lb/>
            decreed him a public funeral, and moreover that every <lb/>
            person should contribute the coin called quadrans, to show <lb/>
            him respect. The women also made a common agreement <lb/>
            to wear mourning for him for a whole year. He was <lb/>
            buried by a decree of the people within the city near the <lb/>
            place called Velia, and all his family were given the <lb/>
            privilege of burial there. At the present day not one of <lb/>
            the family is actually buried there, but the corpse is carried <lb/>
            thither, and laid down, while some one places a lighted <lb/>
            torch under it for a moment, after which it is carried away. <lb/>
            By this ceremony they claim the right, although they <lb/>
            forego it, ald bury the corpse outside the city.</p>

            <title type="main">COMPARISON OF SOLON AND POPLICOLA.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. IT is a print peculiar to this comparison, and which doeR <lb/>
            not occur in any of the other Lives which I have written, <lb/>
            that in turn one imitates and the other bears witness to <lb/>
            his fellow's deeds. Observe, for instance, Solon's definition <lb/>
            of happiness before Crœsus, how much better it suits <lb/>
            Poplicola than Tellus. He says that Tellus was fortunate <lb/>
            because of his good luck, his virtue, and his noble <lb/>
            children; but yet he makes no mention of him or of his <lb/>
            children in his poetry, and he never was a man of any <lb/>
            renown, or held any high office.</p>
          <p>Now Poplicola's virtues made him the most powerful <lb/>
            and glorious of the Romans during his life, and six hundred <lb/>
            years after his death the very noblest families of Rome, <lb/>
            those named Publicola and Messala and Valerius, are <lb/>
            proud to trace their descent from him, even at the present <lb/>
            day. Tellus, it is true, died like a brave man fighting in <lb/>
            the ranks, but Poplicola slew his enemies, which is much <lb/>
            better than being killed oneself, and made his country <lb/>
            victorious by skill as a general and a statesman, and, after <lb/>
            triumphing and enjoying honours of every kind, died the <lb/>
            death which Solon thought so enviable. Besides, Solon, <lb/>
            in his answer to Mimnermus about the time of life, has <lb/>
            written the verses: <lb/>
            u To me may favouring Heaven send, <lb/>
            That all my friends may mourn my end, It <lb/>
            in which he bears witness to the good fortune of Poplicola ; <lb/>
            for he, when he died, was mourned not only by all his <lb/>
            friends and relations but by the whole city, in which <lb/>
            thousands wept for him, while all the women wore mourn­ <lb/>
            ing for him as if he were a son or father of them all that <lb/>
            they had lost.</p><pb n="182"/>
            
          <p>Solon says in his poems, <lb/>
            “ I long for wealth, but not procured <lb/>
            By means unholy." <lb/>
            Now Poplicola not only possessed wealth honourably <lb/>
            acquired, but also was able to spend it, much to his credit. <unclear/> <lb/>
            On relieving the needy. Thus if Solon was the wisest, <lb/>
            Poplicola was certainly the most fortunate of men; for <lb/>
            what Solon prayed for as the greatest blessing, Poplicola <lb/>
            possessed and enjoyed to the end of his days.</p>
          <p>II. Thus has Solon done honour to Poplicola; and he <lb/>
            again honoured Solon by regarding him as the best model <lb/>
            a man could follow in establishing a free constitution : for <lb/>
            he took away the excessive power and dignity of the <lb/>
            consuls and made them inoffensive to the people, and <lb/>
            indeed made use of many of Solon's own laws ; as he em­ <lb/>
            powered the people to elect their own consuls, and gave <lb/>
            defendants a right of appeal to the people from other <lb/>
            courts, just as Solon had done. He did not, like Solon, <lb/>
            make two senates, but he increased the existing one to <lb/>
            nearly double its number. His grounds for the appoint­ <lb/>
            ment of quæstors was to give the consul leisure for more <lb/>
            important matters, if he was an honest man; and if he <lb/>
            was a bad man, to remove the opportunity of fraud which <lb/>
            he would have had if he were supreme over the state and the <lb/>
            treasury at once. In hatred of tyrants Poplicola exceeded <lb/>
            Solon, for he fixed the penalty for a man who might be <lb/>
            proved to be attempting to make himself king, whereas <lb/>
            the Roman allowed any one to kill him without trial. <lb/>
            And while Solon justly prided himself upon his having <lb/>
            been offered the opportunity to make himself despot, with <lb/>
            the full consent of his fellow-countrymen, and yet having <lb/>
            refused it, Poplicola deserves even greater credit for <lb/>
            having been placed in an office of almost despotic power, <lb/>
            and having made it more popular, not using the privileges <lb/>
            with which he was entrusted. Indeed Solon seems to <lb/>
            have been the first to perceive that a people <lb/>
            “ Obeys its rulers best, <lb/>
            When not too free, yet not too much opprest.''</p>
          <p>III. The relief of debtors was a device peculiar to Solon, <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            which more than anything else confirmed the liberty of the <lb/>
            citizens. For laws to establish equality are of no use if <lb/>
            poor men are prevented from enjoying it because of their <lb/>
            debts; and in the states which appear to be the most free, <lb/>
            lien become mere slaves to the rich, and conduct the whole <lb/>
            business of the state at their dictation. It should be <lb/>
            especially noted that although an abolition of debt would <lb/>
            naturally produce a civil war, yet this measure of Solon's, <lb/>
            like an unusual but powerful dose of medicine, actually <lb/>
            put an end to the existing condition of internal strife; for <lb/>
            the well-known probity of Solon's character outweighed <lb/>
            the discredit of the means to which he resorted. In fact <lb/>
            Solon began his public life with greater glory than <lb/>
            Poplicola, for he was the leading spirit, and followed no <lb/>
            man, but entirely single-handed effected the most important <lb/>
            reforms; while Poplicola was more enviable and fortunate <lb/>
            at the close of his career.</p>
          <p>Solon himself saw his own constitution overthrown, <lb/>
            while that of Poplicola preserved order in the city down <lb/>
            to the time of the civil wars; and the reason was that <lb/>
            Solon, as soon as he had enacted his laws, went on his <lb/>
            travels, leaving them written on wooden tablets, defence­ <lb/>
            less against all assailants; whereas Poplicola remained at <lb/>
            home, acted as consul, and by his statesmanship ensured <lb/>
            the success and permanence of the new constitution. <lb/>
            Moreover, Solon could not stop Peisistratus, although he <lb/>
            perceived his designs, but was forced to see a despotism <lb/>
            established; while Poplicola destroyed a monarchy which <lb/>
            had existed for many years, showing equal virtue with <lb/>
            Solon, but greater good fortune and power to enable him <lb/>
            to carry out his intentions.</p>
          <p>IV. With regard to warlike achievements, Daimachus <lb/>
            of Platæa will not even admit that Solon made the cam­ <lb/>
            paign against the Megarians, which we have related; but <lb/>
            Poplicola both by strategy and personal valour won many <lb/>
            great battles. As a statesman, Solon seems to have acted <lb/>
            somewhat childishly in pretending that he was mad, in <lb/>
            order to make his speech about Salamis, while Poplicola <lb/>
            ran the very greatest risks in driving out the tyrant and <lb/>
            crushing the conspiracy. He was especially responsible <lb/>
            for the chief criminals being put to death, and thus not <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            only drove the Tarquins out of the city, but cut off and <lb/>
            destroyed their hopes of return. And while he showed <lb/>
            such vigour in enterprises that required spirit and courage, <lb/>
            he was equally admirable in peaceful negotiations and the <lb/>
            arts of persuasion; for he skilfully won over the formidable <lb/>
            Porsena to be the friend instead of the enemy of Rome.</p>
          <p>Still we may be reminded that Solon stirred up the <lb/>
            Athenians to capture Salamis, which they had given up to <lb/>
            the Megarians, while Poplicola withdrew the Romans from <lb/>
            a country which they had conquered. We must, however, <lb/>
            consider the circumstances under which these events took <lb/>
            place. A subtle politician deals with every thing so as to <lb/>
            turn it to the greatest advantage, and will often lose a <lb/>
            part in order to save the whole, and by sacrificing some <lb/>
            small advantage gain another more important one, as did <lb/>
            Poplicola on that occasion; for he, by withdrawing from <lb/>
            a foreign country, preserved his own, gained the enemy's <lb/>
            camp for the Romans, who before were only too glad to <lb/>
            save their city from ruin, and at last, by converting his <lb/>
            enemy into an arbitrator and winning his cause, obtained <lb/>
            all the fruits of victory: for Porsena put an end to the <lb/>
            war, and left behind him all his war material to show his <lb/>
            respect for the noble character of the consul.</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF THEMISTOKLES</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. THEMISTOKLES came of a family too obscure to entitle him <lb/>
            to distinction. His father, Neokles, was a middle-class <lb/>
            Athenian citizen, of the township of Phrearri and the <lb/>
            tribe Leontis. He was base born on his mother's side, as <lb/>
            the epigram tells us : <lb/>
            “My name's Abrotonon from Thrace, <lb/>
            I boast not old Athenian race; <lb/>
            Yet, humble though my lineage be, <lb/>
            Themistokles was born of me."</p>
          <p>Phanias, however, says that the mother of Themistokles <lb/>
            was a Carian, not a Thracian, and that her name was not <lb/>
            Abrotonon but Euterpe. Manthes even tells us that she <lb/>
            came from the city of Halikarnassus in Caria. All base­ <lb/>
            born Athenians were made to assemble at Kynosarges, a <lb/>
            gymnasium outside the walls sacred to Herakles, who <lb/>
            was regarded as base born among the gods because <lb/>
            his mother was a mortal; and Themistokles induced <lb/>
            several youths of noble birth to come to Kynosarges with <lb/>
            him and join in the wrestling there, an ingenious device <lb/>
            for destroying the exclusive privileges of birth. But, for <lb/>
            all that, he evidently was of the blood of Lykomedes; <lb/>
            for when the barbarians burned down the temple of the <lb/>
            Initiation at Phlya, which belonged to the whole race of <lb/>
            the descendants of Lykomedes, it was restored by The­ <lb/>
            mistokles, as we are told by Slmonides.</p>
          <p>II. He is agreed by all to have been a child of vigorous <lb/>
            impulses, naturally clever, and inclined to take an interest <lb/>
            in important affairs and questions of statesmanship. <lb/>
            During his holidays and times of leisure he did not play <lb/>
            and trifle as other children do, but was always found <lb/>
            arranging some speech by himself and thinking it over. <lb/>
            The speech was always an attack on, or a defence of, some <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            one of his playfellows. His schoolmaster was wont to say, <lb/>
            “ You will be nothing petty, my boy; you will be either <lb/>
            a very good or a very bad man.'</p>
          <p>In his learning, he cared nothing for the exercises <lb/>
            intended to form the character, and mere showy accom­ <lb/>
            plishments and graces, but eagerly applied himself to all <lb/>
            real knowledge, trusting to his natural gifts to enable him <lb/>
            to master what was thought to be too abstruse for his time <lb/>
            of life. In consequence of this, when in society he was <lb/>
            ridiculed by those who thought themselves well mannered <lb/>
            and well educated, he was obliged to make the somewhat <lb/>
            vulgar retort that he could not tune a lute or play upon <lb/>
            the harp, but he could make a small and obscure state great <lb/>
            and glorious.</p>
          <p>In spite of all this, Stesimbrotus says that Themistokles <lb/>
            was a pupil of Anaxagoras, and attended the lectures of <lb/>
            Melissus the physicist; but here he is wrong as to dates. <lb/>
            Melissus was the general who was opposed to Perikles, a <lb/>
            much younger man than Themistokles, when he was <lb/>
            besieging Samos, and Anaxagoras was one of Perikles's <lb/>
            friends. One is more inclined to believe those who tell us <lb/>
            that Themistokles was a follower and admirer of Mnesi­ <lb/>
            philus of Phrearri, who was neither an orator nor a <lb/>
            natural philosopher, but a man who had deeply studied <lb/>
            what went by the name of wisdom, but was really political <lb/>
            sharp practice and expedients of statesmanship, which he <lb/>
            had, as it were, inherited as a legacy from Solon. Those <lb/>
            who in later times mixed up this science with forensic <lb/>
            devices, and used it, not to deal with the facts of politics, <lb/>
            but the abstract ideas of speculative philosophy, were <lb/>
            named Sophists. Themistokles used to converse with this <lb/>
            man when he had already begun his political career. In <lb/>
            his childhood he was capricious and unsteady, his genius, <lb/>
            as yet untempered by reason and experience, showing <lb/>
            great capacities both for good and evil, and after breaking <lb/>
            out into vice, as he himself used afterwards to admit, <lb/>
            saying that the colts which are the hardest to break in <lb/>
            usually make the most valuable horses when properly <lb/>
            taught. But as for the stories which some have fabricated <lb/>
            out of this, about his being disinherited by his father, and <lb/>
            about his mother committing suicide through grief at her <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            son's disgrace, they seem to be untrue. On the other hand, <lb/>
            some writers tell us that his father, wishing to dissuade <lb/>
            him from taking part in politics, pointed out to him the <lb/>
            old triremes lying abandoned on the beach, and told him <lb/>
            that politicians, when the people had no farther use for <lb/>
            them, were cast aside in like manner,</p>
          <p>111. Very early in life Themistokles took a vigorous <lb/>
            part in public affairs, possessed by vehement ambition. <lb/>
            Determined from the very outset that he would become <lb/>
            the leading man in the state, he eagerly entered into all <lb/>
            the schemes for displacing those who where then at the <lb/>
            head of affairs, especially attacking Aristeides, the son of <lb/>
            Lysimachus, whose policy he opposed on every occasion. <lb/>
            Yet his enmity with this man seems to have had a very <lb/>
            boyish commencement; for they both entertained a passion <lb/>
            for the beautiful Stesilaus, who, we are told by Ariston the <lb/>
            philosopher, was descended from a family residing in the <lb/>
            island of Keos. After this difference they espoused different <lb/>
            parties in the state, and their different temper and habits <lb/>
            widened the breach between them. Aristeides was of a <lb/>
            mild and honourable nature, and as a statesman cared <lb/>
            nothing for popularity or personal glory, but did what he <lb/>
            thought right with great caution and strict rectitude. He <lb/>
            was thus often brought into collision with Themistokles, <lb/>
            who was trying to engage the people in many new schemes, <lb/>
            and to introduce startling reforms, by which he would <lb/>
            himself have gained credit, and which Aristeides steadily <lb/>
            opposed.</p>
          <p>He is said to have been so recklessly ambitious and <lb/>
            so frenziedly eager to take part in great events, that though <lb/>
            he was very young at the time of the battle of Marathon, <lb/>
            when the country rang with the praises of the general­ <lb/>
            ship of Miltiades, he was often to be seen buried in thought, <lb/>
            passing sleepless nights and refusing invitations to wine­ <lb/>
            parties, and that he answered those who asked him the <lb/>
            cause of his change of habits, that the trophies of Miltiades <lb/>
            would not let J him sleep. Other men thought that the <lb/>
            victory of Marathon had put an end to the war, but <lb/>
            Themistokles saw that it was but the prelude to a greater <lb/>
            contest, in which he prepared himself to stand forth as the <lb/>
            champion of Greece, and, foreseeing long before what was <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            to come, endeavoured to make the city of Athens ready to <lb/>
            meet it.</p>
          <p>IV. First of all, he had the courage to propose that the <lb/>
            Athenians, instead of dividing amongst themselves the <lb/>
            revenues derived from the silver mines at Laurium, <lb/>
            should construct ships out of this fund for the war with <lb/>
            iEgina. This was then at its height, and the Æginetans, <lb/>
            who had a large navy, were masters of the sea. By this <lb/>
            means Themistokles was more easily enabled to carry his <lb/>
            point, not trying to terrify the people by alluding to <lb/>
            Darius and the Persians, who lived a long way off, and <lb/>
            whom few feared would ever come to attack them, but by <lb/>
            cleverly appealing to their feelings of patriotism against the <lb/>
            Æginetans, to make them consent to the outlay.</p>
          <p>With that money a hundred triremes were built, which <lb/>
            were subsequently used to fight against Xerxes. After <lb/>
            this he kept gradually turning the thoughts of the <lb/>
            Athenians in the direction of the sea, because their land <lb/>
            force was unable even to hold its own against the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring states, while with a powerful fleet they could both <lb/>
            beat off the barbarians and make themselves masters of the <lb/>
            whole of Greece. Thus, as Plato says, instead of station­ <lb/>
            ary soldiers as they were, he made them roving sailors, <lb/>
            and gave rise to the contemptuous remark that Themisto­ <lb/>
            kles took away from the citizens of Athens the shield and <lb/>
            the spear, and reduced them to the oar and the rower's <lb/>
            bench. This, we are told by Stesimbrotus, he effected after <lb/>
            quelling the opposition of Miltiades, who spoke on the <lb/>
            other side. Whether his proceedings at this time were <lb/>
            strictly constitutional or no I shall leave to others to <lb/>
            determine; but that the only safety of Greece lay in its <lb/>
            fleet, and that those triremes were the salvation of the <lb/>
            Athenians after their city was taken, can be proved by the <lb/>
            testimony, among others, of Xerxes himself; for although <lb/>
            his land force was unbroken, he fled after his naval defeat, <lb/>
            as though no longer able to contend with the Greeks, and <lb/>
            he left Mardonius behind more to prevent pursuit, in ray <lb/>
            opinion, than with any hopes of conquest.</p>
          <p>V. Some writers tell us that he was a keen man of <lb/>
            business, and explain that his grand style of living made <lb/>
            this necessary ; for he made costly sacrifices, and entertained <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            foreigners in a splendid manner, all of which required a <lb/>
            large expenditure ; but some accuse him of meanness and <lb/>
            avarice, and even say that he sold presents which were <lb/>
            sent for his table. When Philides the horse-dealer refused <lb/>
            to sell him a colt, he threatened that he would soon make <lb/>
            a wooden horse of the man's house; meaning that he would <lb/>
            stir up lawsuits and claims against him from some of his <lb/>
            relations.</p>
          <p>In ambition he surpassed every one. When yet a young <lb/>
            and unknown man he prevailed upon Epikles of Hermione, <lb/>
            the admired performer on the harp, to practise his art in <lb/>
            his house, hoping thereby to bring many people to it to <lb/>
            listen. And he displeased the Greeks when he went to the <lb/>
            Olympian games by vying with Kimon in the luxury of <lb/>
            his table, his tents, and his other furniture. It was thought <lb/>
            very proper for Kimon, a young man of noble birth, to do <lb/>
            so; but for a man who had not yet made himself a reputa­ <lb/>
            tion, and had not means to support the expense, such <lb/>
            extravagance seemed mere vulgar ostentation. In the <lb/>
            dramatic contest, which even then excited great interest <lb/>
            and rivalry, the play whose expenses he paid for won the <lb/>
            prize. He put up a tablet in memory of his success bearing <lb/>
            the words : Themistokles of Phrearri was choragus, Phryni­ <lb/>
            chus wrote the play, Adeimantus was archon. Yet he was <lb/>
            popular, for he knew every one of the citizens by name, <lb/>
            and gave impartial judgment in all cases referred to him <lb/>
            as arbitrator. Once, when Simonides of Keos asked him to <lb/>
            strain a point in his favour, Themistokles, who was a <lb/>
            general at the time, answered that Simonides would be a <lb/>
            bad poet if he sang out of tune; and he would be a bad <lb/>
            magistrate if he favoured men against the law. A t another <lb/>
            time he rallied Simonides on his folly in abusing the <lb/>
            Corinthians, who inhabited so fine a city, and in having <lb/>
            his own statue carved, though he was so ugly. He continued <lb/>
            to increase in popularity by judiciously courting the favour <lb/>
            of the people, and was at length able to secure the triumph <lb/>
            of his own party, and the banishment of his rival Aristeides.</p>
          <p>VI. As the Persians were now about to invade Greece, <lb/>
            th 3 Athenians deliberated as to who should be their leader. <lb/>
            It is said that most men refused the post of General through <lb/>
            fear, but that Epikydes, the son of Euphemides, a clever <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            mob-orator, but cowardly and accessible to bribes, desired <lb/>
            to be appointed, and seemed very likely to be elected. <lb/>
            Themistokles, fearing that the state would be utterly <lb/>
            ruined if its affairs fell into such hands, bribed him into <lb/>
            forgetting his ambitious designs, and withdrawing hip <lb/>
            candidature.</p>
          <p>He was much admired for his conduct when envoys <lb/>
            came from the Persian king to demand earth and water, <lb/>
            in token of submission. He seized the interpreter, and by <lb/>
            a decree of the people had him put to death, because he <lb/>
            had dared to translate the commands of a barbarian into <lb/>
            the language of free Greeks. He acted in the same way <lb/>
            to Arthmias of Zelea. This man, at the instance of The­ <lb/>
            mistokles, was declared infamous, he and his children and <lb/>
            his descendants for ever, because he brought Persian gold <lb/>
            among the Greeks. His greatest achievement of all, <lb/>
            however, was, that he put an end to all the internal wars <lb/>
            in Greece, and reconciled the states with one another, <lb/>
            inducing them to defer the settlement of their feuds until <lb/>
            after the Persian war. In this he is said to have been <lb/>
            greatly assisted by Chileon the Arcadian.</p>
          <p>VII. On his appointment as General, he at once en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to prevail upon his countrymen to man their <lb/>
            fleet, leave their city, and go to meet the enemy by sea as <lb/>
            far from Greece as possible. As this met with great <lb/>
            opposition, he, together with the Lacedæmonians, led a <lb/>
            large force as far as the Vale of Tempe, which they in­ <lb/>
            tended to make their first line of defence, as Thessaly had <lb/>
            not at that time declared for the Persians. When, how­ <lb/>
            ever, the armies were forced to retire from thence, and <lb/>
            all Greece, up to Bœotia, declared for the Persians, the <lb/>
            Athenians became more willing to listen to Themistokles <lb/>
            about fighting by sea, and he was sent with a fleet to <lb/>
            guard the straits at Artemisium. Here the Greeks chose <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, and their general, Eurybiades, to <lb/>
            take the command; but the Athenians refused to submit <lb/>
            to any other state, because they alone furnished more <lb/>
            ships than all the rest. Themistokles, at this crisis per­ <lb/>
            ceiving the danger, gave up his claims to Eurybiades, and <lb/>
            soothed the wounded pride of the Athenians, telling them <lb/>
            that if they proved themselves brave men in the war, they <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            would find that all the other states in Greece would <lb/>
            cheerfully recognise their supremacy. On this account he <lb/>
            seems more than any one else to deserve the credit of having <lb/>
            saved Greece, and to have covered the Athenians with glory <lb/>
            by teaching them to surpass their enemies in bravery, and <lb/>
            their allies in good sense. When the Persian fleet reached <lb/>
            Aphetai, Eurybiades was terrified at the number of ships <lb/>
            at the mouth of the Straits, and, learning that two <lb/>
            hundred sail more were gone round the outside of Euboea <lb/>
            to take him in the rear, he at once wished to retire further <lb/>
            into Greece, and support the fleet by the land army in <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, for he regarded the Persian king's fleet as <lb/>
            utterly irresistible at sea. Upon this the Eubœans, who <lb/>
            feared to be deserted by the Greeks, sent one Pelagon with <lb/>
            a large sum of money, to make secret proposals to Themis­ <lb/>
            tokles. He took the money, Herodotus tells us, and gave <lb/>
            it to Eurybiades and his party. One of those who most <lb/>
            vehemently opposed him was Architeles, the captain of <lb/>
            the Sacred Trireme, who had not sufficient money to pay <lb/>
            his crew, and therefore wished to sail back to Athens. <lb/>
            Themistokles stirred up the anger of his men to such a <lb/>
            pitch that they rushed upon him and took away his <lb/>
            supper. At this, Architeles was much vexed, but Themis­ <lb/>
            tokles sent him a basket containing bread and meat, with <lb/>
            a talent of silver hidden underneath it, with a message <lb/>
            bidding him eat his supper and pay his men the next day, <lb/>
            but that, if he did not, Themistokles would denounce him <lb/>
            to his countrymen as having received bribes from the <lb/>
            enemy. This we are told by Phanias of Lesbos.</p>
          <p>VIII. The battles which took place in the Straits with <lb/>
            the Persian ships, were indeed indecisive, but the experience <lb/>
            gained in them was of the greatest value to the Greeks, as <lb/>
            they were taught by their result that multitudes of ships <lb/>
            and splendid ensigns, and the boastful war-cries of bar­ <lb/>
            barians, avail nothing against men who dare to fight hand <lb/>
            to hand, and that they must disregard all these and boldly <lb/>
            grapple with their enemies. Pindar seems to have under­ <lb/>
            stood this when he says, about the battle at Artem isium, <lb/>
            that there <lb/>
            “ The sons of Athens laid <lb/>
            Their freedom'a grand foundation.” <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            for indeed confidence leads to victory. This <unclear>Artemisium</unclear> <lb/>
            is a promontory of the island of Eubœa, stretching north­ <lb/>
            wards beyond Hestiæa; and opposite to it is Olizon, which <lb/>
            was once part of the dominions of Philoktetes. There is <lb/>
            upon it a small temple of Artemis (Diana), which is called <lb/>
            the Temple towards the East." Round it stand trees <lb/>
            and a circle of pillars of white stone. This stone, when <lb/>
            rubbed in the hand, has the colour and smell of saffron. <lb/>
            On one of these pillars were written the following verses: <lb/>
            “ The sons of Athens once overcame in fight <lb/>
            All Asia's tribes, on yonder sea ; <lb/>
            They raised these pillars round Diana's shrine, <lb/>
            To thank her for their victory." <lb/>
            Even now a place is pointed out on the beach where, under <lb/>
            a great heap of sand, there is a deep bed of black ashes <lb/>
            where it is thought the wrecks and dead bodies were <lb/>
            burned.</p>
          <p>IX. But when the news of Thermopylae was brought to <lb/>
            the Greeks at Artemisium, that Leonidas had fallen, and <lb/>
            Xerxes was in possession of the passes, they retired further <lb/>
            into Greece, the Athenians protecting the rear on account <lb/>
            of their bravery, and full of pride at their achievements. <lb/>
            At all the harbours and landing-places along the coast, <lb/>
            Themistokles, as he passed by, cut conspicuous inscriptions <lb/>
            on stones, some of which he found on the spot, and others <lb/>
            which he himself set up at all the watering-places and <lb/>
            convenient stations for ships. In these inscriptions he <lb/>
            besought the Ionians, if possible, to come over to the <lb/>
            Athenians, who were their fathers, and who were fighting <lb/>
            for their liberty; and if they could not do this, to throw <lb/>
            the barbarian army into confusion during battle. He <lb/>
            hoped that these writings would either bring the Ionians <lb/>
            over tJ the side of the Greeks, or make them suspected of <lb/>
            treason by the Persians.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Xerxes invaded Greece through Doris, and <lb/>
            came into Phokis, where he burned the city of the Phokæans. <lb/>
            The Greeks made no resistance, although the Athenians <lb/>
            begged them to make a stand in Bœotia, and cover Attica, <lb/>
            urging that they had fought in defence of the whole of <lb/>
            Greece at Artemisium, However, as no one would listen <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            to them, but all the rest of the Greeks determined to defend <lb/>
            the Peloponnesus, and were collecting all their forces within <lb/>
            it, and building a wall across the Isthmus from sea to sea, <lb/>
            the Athenians were enraged at their treachery, and dis­ <lb/>
            heartened at being thus abandoned to their fate. They <lb/>
            had no thoughts of resisting so enormous an army; and <lb/>
            the only thing they could do under the circumstances, to <lb/>
            abandon their city and trust to their ships, was distasteful <lb/>
            to the people, who saw nothing to be gained by victory, <lb/>
            and no advantage in life, if they had to desert the temples <lb/>
            of their gods and the monuments of their fathers.</p>
          <p>X. At this crisis, Themistokles, despairing of influencing <lb/>
            the populace by human reasoning, just as a dramatist has <lb/>
            recourse to supernatural machinery, produced signs and <lb/>
            wonders and oracles. He argued that it was a portent <lb/>
            that the sacred snake during those days deserted his usual <lb/>
            haunt. The priests, who found their daily offerings to <lb/>
            him of the firstfruits of the sacrifices left untouched, told <lb/>
            the people, at the instigation of Themistokles, that the <lb/>
            goddess Athena (Minerva) had left the city, and was <lb/>
            leading them to the sea. He also swayed the popular <lb/>
            mind by the oracle, in which he argued that by " wooden <lb/>
            walls" ships were alluded to; and that Apollo spoke of <lb/>
            Salamis as “ divine," not terrible or sad, because Salamis <lb/>
            would be the cause of great good fortune to the Greeks. <lb/>
            Having thus gained his point, he proposed a decree, that <lb/>
            the city be left to the care of the tutelary goddess of the <lb/>
            Athenians, that all able-bodied men should embark in the <lb/>
            ships of war, and that each man should take the best <lb/>
            measures in his power to save the women and children <lb/>
            and slaves.</p>
          <p>When this decree was passed, most of the Athenians sent <lb/>
            their aged folks and women over to Trœzen, where they were <lb/>
            hospitably received by the Troezenians, who decreed that <lb/>
            they should be maintained at the public expense, receiving <lb/>
            each two obols a day, that the children should be allowed <lb/>
            to pick the fruit from any man's tree, and even that their <lb/>
            school expenses should be paid. This decree was proposed <lb/>
            by Nikagoras.</p>
          <p>The Athenians at this time had no public funds, yet <lb/>
            Aristotle tells us that the Senate of the Areopagus, by <note type="footnote"> o </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            supplying each fighting man with eight drachmas, did <lb/>
            good service in manning the fleet; and Kleidemus tells us <lb/>
            that this money was obtained by an artifice of Themistokles. <lb/>
            When the Athenians were going down to the Peiræus, he <lb/>
            gave out that the Gorgon's head had been lost from the <lb/>
            statue of the goddess. Themistokles, under pretext of <lb/>
            seeking for it, searched every man, and found great stores <lb/>
            of money hidden in their luggage, which he confiscated, <lb/>
            and thus was able to supply the crews of the ships with <lb/>
            abundance of necessaries. When the whole city put to <lb/>
            sea, the sight affected some to pity, while others admired <lb/>
            their courage in sending their families out of the way that <lb/>
            they might not be disturbed by weeping and wailing as <lb/>
            they went over to Salamis. Yet many of the aged citizens <lb/>
            who were left behind at Athens afforded a piteous sight; <lb/>
            and even the domestic animals, as they ran howling to the <lb/>
            sea-shore, accompanying their masters, touched men's hearts. <lb/>
            It is said that the dog of Xanthippus, the father of Perikles, <lb/>
            could not endure to be separated from him, and jumping <lb/>
            into the sea swam alongside of his trireme, reached Salamis, <lb/>
            and then at once died. His tomb is even now to be seen <lb/>
            at the place called Kynossema.</p>
          <p>XI. Besides these great achievements, Themistokles, <lb/>
            perceiving that his countrymen longed to have Aristeides <lb/>
            back again, and fearing that he might ally himself with <lb/>
            the Persian, and work ruin to Greece out of anger against <lb/>
            his own country (for Aristeides had been banished from <lb/>
            Athens before the war when Themistokles came into power), <lb/>
            proposed a decree, that any citizen who had been banished <lb/>
            for a term of years, might return and do his best by word <lb/>
            and deed to serve his country- together with the other <lb/>
            citizens.</p>
          <p>Eurybiades, on account of the prestige of Sparta, held <lb/>
            the chief command of the fleet, but was unwilling to risk <lb/>
            a battle, preferring to weigh anchor and sail to the Isthmus <lb/>
            where the land army of the Peloponnesians was assembled. <lb/>
            This project was opposed by Themistokles ; and it was on <lb/>
            this occasion that he made use of the following well-known <lb/>
            saving: When Eurybiades said to him, " Themistokles, in <lb/>
            the public games they whip those who rise before their <lb/>
            turn." “ True,” said Themistokles, “but they do not crown <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            those who lag behind." And when Eurybiades raised his <lb/>
            staff as if he would strike him, Themistokles said, " Strike, <lb/>
            but hear me." When Eurybiades, in wonder at his gentle <lb/>
            temper, bade him speak, he again urged Eurybiades to <lb/>
            remain at Salamis. Some one then said, that a main <lb/>
            without a city had no right to tell those who still possessed <lb/>
            one to abandon it, but Themistokles turning upon him, <lb/>
            answered, " Wretch, we Athenians have indeed abandoned <lb/>
            our walls and houses, because we scorn to be slaves for <lb/>
            the sake of mere buildings, but we have the greatest city <lb/>
            of all Greece, our two hundred ships of war, which now <lb/>
            are ready to help you if you choose to be saved by their <lb/>
            means; but, if you betray us and leave us, some of the <lb/>
            Greeks will soon learn to their cost that the Athenians <lb/>
            have obtained a free city and a territory no worse than <lb/>
            that which they left behind." When Eurybiades heard <lb/>
            Themistokles use this language, he began to fear that the <lb/>
            Athenians might really sail away and leave him.</p>
          <p>When Eretrieus tried to say something to Themistokles, <lb/>
            he answered, " Do you too dare to say anything about war, <lb/>
            you, who like a cuttle-fish, have a sword but no heart."</p>
          <p>XII. It is said by some writers that while Themistokles <lb/>
            was talking about these matters upon the deck of his ship, <lb/>
            an owl was seen to fly from the right-hand side of the fleet, <lb/>
            and to perch upon his mast; which omen encouraged all <lb/>
            the Athenians to fight. But when the Persian host poured <lb/>
            down to Phalerum, covering the whole sea-shore, and the <lb/>
            king himself was seen with all his forces, coming down <lb/>
            to the beach with the infantry, the Greeks forgot the words <lb/>
            of Themistokles, and began to cast eager glances towards <lb/>
            the Isthmus and to be angry with any one who proposed <lb/>
            to do anything else than withdraw. They determined <lb/>
            to retire by night, and the steersmen were given orders <lb/>
            to prepare for a voyage. Themistokles, enraged at the <lb/>
            idea of the Greek fleet dispersing, and losing the advantage <lb/>
            of the narrow waters, planned the affair of Sikinnus. This <lb/>
            Sikinnus was a Persian who had been taken prisoner, and <lb/>
            who was fond of Themistokles and took charge of his <lb/>
            children. He sent this man secretly to Xerxes, ordering <lb/>
            him to say that Themistokles, the general of the Athenians, <lb/>
            has determined to come over to the king of the Persians, <note type="footnote"> o 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            and is the first to tell him that the Greeks are about to <lb/>
            retreat. He bids him not to allow them to fly, but to <lb/>
            attack them while they are disheartened at not being <lb/>
            supported by a land force, and destroy their fleet.</p>
          <p>Xerxes, who imagined this to be said for his advantage, <lb/>
            was delighted, and at once gave orders to the commanders <lb/>
            of his ships to make ready for battle at their leisure, all <lb/>
            but two hundred, whom he ordered to put to sea at once, <lb/>
            surround the whole strait, and close up the passages <lb/>
            through the islands, so that no one of the enemy could <lb/>
            escape. While this was being done, Aristeides, the son of <lb/>
            Lysimachus, who was the first to perceive it, came to the <lb/>
            tent of Themistokles, although the latter was his enemy, <lb/>
            and had driven him into exile. When Themistokles came <lb/>
            to meet him, he told him they were surrounded; knowing <lb/>
            the frank and noble character of Aristeides, Themistokles <lb/>
            told him the whole plot, and begged him as a man in whom <lb/>
            the Greeks could trust, to encourage them to fight a battle in <lb/>
            the straits. Aristeides praised Themistokles for what he had <lb/>
            done, and went round to the other generals and captains of <lb/>
            ships, inciting them to fight. Yet they were inclined to <lb/>
            doubt even the word of Aristeides, when a trireme from the <lb/>
            island of Tenos, under the command of Panaitios, came in, <lb/>
            having deserted from the enemy, and brought the news <lb/>
            that the Greeks were really surrounded. Then, in a spirit <lb/>
            of anger and despair, they prepared for the struggle.</p>
          <p>XIII. At daybreak Xerxes took his seat on a high cliff <lb/>
            overlooking all his host, just above the Temple of Herakles, <lb/>
            we are told by Phanodemus, where the strait between <lb/>
            Salamis and Attica is narrowest, but according to Akes­ <lb/>
            todorus, close to the Megarian frontier, upon the mountains <lb/>
            called Horns. Here he sat upon the golden throne, with <lb/>
            many scribes standing near, whose duty it was to write <lb/>
            down the events of the battle.</p>
          <p>While Themistokles was sacrificing on the beach, beside <lb/>
            the admiral's ship, three most beautiful captive boys were <lb/>
            brought to him, splendidly adorned with gold and fine <lb/>
            clothes. They were said to be the children of Sandauke, <lb/>
            the sister of Xerxes, and Artäuktes. When Euphrantides <lb/>
            the prophet saw them, there shone at once from the victims <lb/>
            on the altar a great and brilliant flame, and at the same <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            time some one was heard to sneeze on the right hand, <lb/>
            which is a good omen. Euphrantides now besought <lb/>
            Themistokles to sacrifice these young men as victims to <lb/>
            Dionysus, to whom human beings are sacrificed; so should <lb/>
            the Greeks obtain safety and victory. Themistokles was <lb/>
            struck with horror at this terrible proposal; but the <lb/>
            multitude, who, as is natural with people in great danger, <lb/>
            hoped to be saved by miraculous rather than by <lb/>
            ordinary means, called upon the God with one voice, <lb/>
            and leading the captives up to the altar, compelled him <lb/>
            to offer them up as the prophet bade him. This story rests <lb/>
            on the authority of Phanias of Lesbos, who was a man of <lb/>
            education, and well read in history.</p>
          <p>XIV. As for the numbers of the Persian fleet, the poet <lb/>
            AEschylus, as though he knew it clearly, writes as follows <lb/>
            in his tragedy of the Persæ : <lb/>
            " And well I know a thousand sail <lb/>
            That day did Xerxes meet, <lb/>
            And seven and two hundred more, <lb/>
            The fastest of his fleet."</p>
          <p>The Athenian ships, a hundred and eighty in number, <lb/>
            had each eighteen men on deck, four of whom were archers, <lb/>
            and the rest heavy-armed soldiers. Themistokles now chose <lb/>
            the time for the battle as judiciously as he had chosen the <lb/>
            place, and would not bring his triremes into line of battle <lb/>
            before the fresh wind off the sea, as is usual in the morning, <lb/>
            raised a heavy swell in the straits. This did not damage <lb/>
            the low flat ships of the Greeks, but it caught the high­ <lb/>
            sterned Persian ships, over-weighted as they were with <lb/>
            lofty decks, and presented their broadsides to the Greeks, <lb/>
            who eagerly attacked them, watching Themistokles because <lb/>
            he was their best example, and also because Ariamenes, <lb/>
            Xerxes's admiral, and the bravest and best of the king's <lb/>
            brothers, attacked him in a huge ship, from which, as if <lb/>
            from a castle, he poured darts and arrows upon him.</p>
          <p>But Ameinias of Dekeleia and Sokles of Pedia, who were <lb/>
            both sailing in the same vessel, met him stem to stem. <lb/>
            Each ship crashed into the other with its iron beak, and <lb/>
            was torn open. Ariamenes attempted to board the Greek <lb/>
            ship, but these two men set upon him with their spears, <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            and drove him into the sea. His body was noticed by <lb/>
            Queen Artemisia floating amongst the other wreckage, and <lb/>
            was by her brought to Xerxes.</p>
          <p>XV. At this period of the battle it is said that a great <lb/>
            light was seen to shine from Eleusis, and that a great noise <lb/>
            was heard upon the Thriasian plain near the sea, as though <lb/>
            multitudes of men were escorting the mystic lacchus in <lb/>
            procession. From the place where these sounds were <lb/>
            heard a mist seemed to spread over the sea and envelop <lb/>
            the ships. Others thought that they saw spirit-forms <unclear>o</unclear>. <lb/>
            armed men come from Ægina, and hold their hands before <lb/>
            the ships of the Greeks. These it was supposed were the <lb/>
            Æakid heroes, to whom prayers for help had been offered <lb/>
            just before the battle. The first man to capture a ship <lb/>
            was Lykomedes, an Athenian captain, who cut off its <lb/>
            ensign and dedicated it to Apollo with the laurel crown at <lb/>
            the Temple at Phlyæ.</p>
          <p>In the narrow straits the Persians were unable to bring <lb/>
            more than a part of their fleet into action, and their ships <lb/>
            got into each other's way, so that the Greeks could meet <lb/>
            them on equal terms, and, although they resisted until <lb/>
            evening, completely routed them, winning, as Simonides <lb/>
            calls it, that " glorious and famous victory," the greatest <lb/>
            exploit ever achieved at sea, which owed its success to the <lb/>
            bravery of the sailors and the genius of Themistokles.</p>
          <p>XVI. After this naval defeat, Xerxes, enraged at his <lb/>
            failure, endeavoured to fill up the strait with earth, and so <lb/>
            to make a passage for his land forces to Salamis, to attack <lb/>
            the Greeks there. Now Themistokles, in order to try the <lb/>
            temper of Aristeides, proposed that the fleet should sail to <lb/>
            the Hellespont, and break the bridge of boats there, " in <lb/>
            order," said he, " that we may conquer Asia in Europe." <lb/>
            But Aristeides disapproved of this measure, saying, <lb/>
            " Hitherto we have fought against the Persian king, <lb/>
            while he has been at his ease; but if we shut him up in <lb/>
            Greece, and drive the chief of so large an army to despair, <lb/>
            ;he will no longer sit quietly under a golden umbrella to <lb/>
            look on at his battles, but will strain every nerve and <lb/>
            superintend every operation in person, and so will easily <lb/>
            retrieve his losses and form better plans for the future."</p>
          <p>" Instead of breaking down the existing bridge for him, <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            Themistokles," said he, "we ought rather, if possible, <lb/>
            at once to build another, and send the man out of Europe <lb/>
            as quickly as possible." " Well then," answered Themis­ <lb/>
            tokles," if you think that our interest lies in that <lb/>
            direction, we ought all to consider and contrive to send <lb/>
            him out of Greece as fast as we can." When this <lb/>
            resolution was adopted, Themistokles sent one of the <lb/>
            king's eunuchs, whom he had found among the prisoners, <lb/>
            bidding him warn Xerxes that " the Greeks had deter­ <lb/>
            mined after their victory to sail to the Hellespont and <lb/>
            break the bridge, but that Themistokles, out of his regard <lb/>
            for the king, advises him to proceed as fast as he can to his <lb/>
            own sea, and cross over it, while he (Themistokles) gained <lb/>
            time for him by delaying the allied fleet." Xerxes, hearing <lb/>
            thus, was much alarmed and retired in all haste. And <lb/>
            indeed the battle with Mardonius at Plataea shows us <lb/>
            which of the two was right; for the Greeks there could <lb/>
            scarcely deal with a small part of the Persian army, and <lb/>
            what therefore could they have done with the whole ?</p>
          <p>XVII. Herodotus tells us that, of Greek States, Ægina <lb/>
            received the prize of valour, and that, of the generals, it <lb/>
            was awarded to Themistokles, though against the will of <lb/>
            the voters. When the armies retired to the Isthmus all <lb/>
            the generals laid their votes on the altar there, and each <lb/>
            man declared himself to deserve the first prize for valour, <lb/>
            and Themistokles to deserve the second. However, the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians brought him home with them to Sparta, and <lb/>
            gave Eurybiades the first prize for valour, but Themistokles <lb/>
            that for wisdom, a crown of olive-leaves. They also gave <lb/>
            him the best chariot in their city, and sent three hundred <lb/>
            of their young men to escort him out of the country. It <lb/>
            is also related that at the next Olympian games, when <lb/>
            Themistokles appeared upon the race-course, all the <lb/>
            spectators took no further interest in the contests, but <lb/>
            passed the whole day in admiring and applauding him, and <lb/>
            in pointing him out to such as were strangers; so that he was <lb/>
            delighted, and said to his friends that he had now received <lb/>
            his reward for all his labour on behalf of Greece.</p>
          <p>XVIII. He was by nature excessively fond of admiration, <lb/>
            as we may judge from the stories about him which have <lb/>
            been preserved. Once, when he was made admiral of the <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            Athenian fleet, he put off all the necessary business of his <lb/>
            office until the day appointed for sailing, in order that <lb/>
            he might have a great many dealings with various people <lb/>
            all at once, and so appear to be a person of great influence <lb/>
            and importance. And when he saw the corpses floating <lb/>
            in the sea with gold bracelets and necklaces, he himself <lb/>
            passed them by, but pointed them out to a friend who was <lb/>
            following, saying, " Do you pick them up and keep them ; <lb/>
            for you are not Themistokles." A beautiful youth, named <lb/>
            Antiphates, regarded him coolly at first, but eventually <lb/>
            became submissive to him because of his immense <lb/>
            reputation. " Young man," said Themistokles, " it has <lb/>
            taken some time, but we have at length both regained our <lb/>
            right minds." He used to say that the Athenians neither <lb/>
            admired nor respected him, but used him like a plane-tree <lb/>
            under which they took shelter in storm, but which in fair <lb/>
            weather they lopped and stripped of its leaves. Once <lb/>
            when a citizen of Seriphos said to him that he owed his <lb/>
            glory, not to himself but to his city, he answered, " Very <lb/>
            true ; I should not have become a great man if I had been <lb/>
            a Seriphian, nor would you if you had been an Athenian." <lb/>
            When one of his fellow-generals, who thought that he had <lb/>
            done the state good service, was taking a haughty tone, <lb/>
            and comparing his exploits with those of Themistokles, <lb/>
            he said, " The day after a feast, once upon a time, boasted <lb/>
            that it was better than the feast-day itself, because on that <lb/>
            day all men are full of anxiety and trouble, while upon <lb/>
            the next day every one enjoys what has been prepared <lb/>
            at his leisure. But the feast-day answered, ' Very true, <lb/>
            only but for me you never would have been at all.' So <lb/>
            now," said he, " if I had not come first, where would you <lb/>
            all have been now ? " His son, who was spoiled by his <lb/>
            mother, and by himself to please her, he said was the most <lb/>
            powerful person in Greece; for the Athenians ruled the <lb/>
            Greeks, he ruled the Athenians, his wife ruled him, and <lb/>
            his son ruled his wife. Wishing to be singular in all <lb/>
            things, when he put up a plot of ground for sale, he <lb/>
            ordered the crier to announce that there were good neigh­ <lb/>
            hours next to it. When two men paid their addresses to <lb/>
            his daughter, he chose the more agreeable instead of the <lb/>
            richer of the two, saying that he preferred a man without <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            money to money without a man. Such was his character, <lb/>
            as shown in his talk.</p>
          <p>XIX. Immediately after the great war, he began to <lb/>
            rebuild and fortify the city. In order to succeed in this, <lb/>
            Theopompus says that he bribed the Spartan ephors into <lb/>
            laying aside opposition, but most writers say that he out­ <lb/>
            witted them by proceeding to Sparta nominally on an <lb/>
            embassy. Then when the Spartans complained to him <lb/>
            that Athens was being fortified, and when Poliarchus <lb/>
            came expressly from Ægina to charge him with it, he <lb/>
            denied it, and bade them send commissioners to Athens to <lb/>
            see whether it was true, wishing both to obtain time for <lb/>
            the fortifications to be built, and also to place these <lb/>
            commissioners in the hands of the Athenians, as hostages <lb/>
            for his own safety. His expectations were realised; for <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, on discovering the truth, did him no <lb/>
            harm, but dissembled their anger and sent him away. <lb/>
            After this he built Peiræus, as he perceived the excellence <lb/>
            of its harbours, and was desirous to turn the whole <lb/>
            attention of the Athenians to naval pursuits. In this he <lb/>
            pursued a policy exactly the opposite to that of the ancient <lb/>
            kings of Attica; for they are said to have endeavoured to <lb/>
            keep their subjects away from the sea, and to accustom <lb/>
            them to till the ground instead of going on board ships, <lb/>
            quoting the legend that Athene and Poseidon had a contest <lb/>
            for the possession of the land, and that she gained a <lb/>
            decision in her favour by the production of the sacred <lb/>
            olive. Themistokles, on the other hand, did not so much <lb/>
            " stick Peiræus on to Athens," as Aristophanes the comio <lb/>
            poet said, as make the city dependent upon Peiraeus, and <lb/>
            the land dependent on the sea. By this means he trans­ <lb/>
            f'erred power from the nobles to the people, because sailors <lb/>
            and pilots became the real strength of the State. For <lb/>
            this reason the thirty tyrants destroyed the bema, or <lb/>
            tribune on the place of public assembly, which was built <lb/>
            looking towards the sea, and built another which looked <lb/>
            inland, because they thought that the naval supremacy of <lb/>
            Athens had been the origin of its democratic constitution, <lb/>
            and that an oligarchy had less to fear from men who <lb/>
            cultivated the land.</p>
          <p>XX. Themistokles had even more extended views than <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            these about making the Athenians supreme at sea. When <lb/>
            Xerxes was gone, the whole Greek fleet was drawn up on <lb/>
            shore for the winter at Pagasæ. Themistokles then <lb/>
            publicly told the Athenians that he had a plan which <lb/>
            would save and benefit them all, but which must not be <lb/>
            divulged. The Athenians bade him tell Aristeides only, <lb/>
            and to execute his designs if he approved.</p>
          <p>Themistokles then told Aristeides that his design was to <lb/>
            burn the whole Greek fleet as they lay on the beach. But <lb/>
            Aristeides came forward and told the people that no proposal <lb/>
            could be more advantageous or more villainous ; so that the <lb/>
            Athenians forbade Themistokles to proceed with it. On <lb/>
            another occasion the Lacedæmonians proposed, in a meeting <lb/>
            of the Amphiktyonic council, that all States that had taken <lb/>
            no part in the Persian war should be excluded from that <lb/>
            council; Themistokles, fearing that if the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            should exclude Thessaly, Argos, and Thebes, they would <lb/>
            have complete control over the votes, and be able to carry <lb/>
            what measures they pleased, made representations to the <lb/>
            various States, and influenced the votes of their deputies <lb/>
            at the meeting, pointing out to them that there were only <lb/>
            thirty-one States which took any part in the war, and <lb/>
            that most of these were very small ones, so that it <lb/>
            would be unreasonable for one or two powerful States <lb/>
            to pronounce the rest of Greece outlawed, and be <lb/>
            supreme in the council. After this he generally opposed <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians; wherefore they paid special court <lb/>
            to Kimon, in order to establish him as a political rival to <lb/>
            Themistokles.</p>
          <p>XXI. Moreover, he made himself odious to the allies by <lb/>
            sailing about the islands and wringing money from them. <lb/>
            A case in point is the conversation which Herodotus tells <lb/>
            us he held with the people of Andros, when trying to get <lb/>
            money from them. He said that he was come, bringing <lb/>
            with him two gods, Persuasion and Necessity ; but they <lb/>
            replied that they also possessed two equally powerful ones, <lb/>
            Poverty and Helplessness, by whom they were prevented <lb/>
            from supplying him with money. The poet, Tinlokreon of <lb/>
            Rhodes, in one of his songs, writes bitterly of Themistokles, <lb/>
            saying that he was prevailed upon by the bribes which he <lb/>
            received from exiles to restore them to their native country, <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            but abandoned himself, who was his guest and friend. <lb/>
            The song runs as follows : <lb/>
            " Though ye may sing Pausanias or Xanthippus in your lays, <lb/>
            Or Leotycbides, 'tis Aristeides whom I praise, <lb/>
            The best of men as yet produced by holy Athens' State, <lb/>
            Since thus upon Themistokles has fall'n Latona's lite : <lb/>
            That liar and that traitor base, who for a bribe unclean, <lb/>
            Refused to reinstate a man who his own guest had been. <lb/>
            His friend too, in his native Ialysus, but who took <lb/>
            Three silver talents with him, and his friend forsook. <lb/>
            Bad luck go with the fellow, who unjustly some restores <lb/>
            From exile, while some others he had banished from our shores, <lb/>
            And some he puts to death; and sits among us gorged with pelf. <lb/>
            He kept an ample table at the Isthmian games himself, <lb/>
            And gave to every guest that came full plenty of cold moat, <lb/>
            The which they with a prayer did each and every of them eat, <lb/>
            But their prayer was ' Next year be there no Themistokles to <lb/>
            meet.'" <lb/>
            And after the exile and condemnation of Themistokles, <lb/>
            Timokreon wrote much more abusively about him in a <lb/>
            song which begins, <lb/>
            " Muse, far away, <lb/>
            Sound this my lay, <lb/>
            For it both meet and right is." <lb/>
            It is said that Timokreon was exiled from home for having <lb/>
            dealings with the Persians, and that Themistokles con­ <lb/>
            firmed his sentence. When, then, Themistokles was <lb/>
            charged with intriguing with the Persians, Timokreon <lb/>
            wrote upon him, <lb/>
            " Timokreon is not the only Greek <lb/>
            That turned a traitor, Persian gold to seek; <lb/>
            I'In not the only fox without a tail, <lb/>
            But others put their honour up for sale."</p>
          <p>XXII. As the Athenians, through his unpopularity, <lb/>
            eagerly listened to any story to his discredit, he was <lb/>
            obliged to weary them by constantly repeating the tale of <lb/>
            his own exploits to them. In answer to those who were <lb/>
            angry with him, he would ask, " Are you weary of always <lb/>
            receiving benefits from the same hand ? " He also vexed <lb/>
            the people by building the Temple of Artemis of Good <lb/>
            Counsel, as he called her, hinting that he had taken good <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            counsel for the Greeks. This temple he placed close to his <lb/>
            own house in Melite, at the place where at the present day <lb/>
            the public executioner casts out the bodies of executed <lb/>
            criminals, and the clothes and ropes of men who have <lb/>
            hanged themselves. Even in our own times a small statue <lb/>
            of Themistokles used to stand in the Temple of Artemis of <lb/>
            Good Counsel; and he seems to have been a hero not only <lb/>
            in mind, but in appearance. The Athenians made use of <lb/>
            ostracism to banish him, in order to reduce his extravagant <lb/>
            pretensions, as they always were wont to do in the case of <lb/>
            men whom they thought over powerful and unfit for living <lb/>
            in the equality of a democracy. For ostracism implied no <lb/>
            censure, but was intended as a vent for envious feelings, <lb/>
            which were satisfied by seeing the object of their hatred <lb/>
            thus humbled.</p>
          <p>XXIII. When Themistokles was banished from Athens, <lb/>
            he lived in Argos, during which time the proceedings of <lb/>
            rausanias gave a great opportunity to his enemies. He <lb/>
            was impeached on a charge of treason by Leobotes, the son <lb/>
            of Alkmæon of Agraulai, and the Spartans joined in the <lb/>
            impeachment. Pausanias, indeed, at first concealed his <lb/>
            treacherous designs from Themistokles, although he was <lb/>
            his friend; but when he saw that Themistokles was <lb/>
            banished, and chafing at the treatment he had received, he <lb/>
            was encouraged to ask him to share his treason, and <lb/>
            showed him the letters which he had received from the <lb/>
            Persian king, at the same time inflaming his resentment <lb/>
            against the Greeks, whom he spoke of as ungrateful <lb/>
            wretches. Themistokles refused utterly to join Pausanias, <lb/>
            but nevertheless told no one of his treasonable practices, <lb/>
            either because he hoped that he would desist, or that his <lb/>
            visionary and impossible projects would be disclosed by <lb/>
            other means. And thus it was that when Pausanias was <lb/>
            put to death, certain letters and writings on this subject <lb/>
            were found, which threw suspicion upon Themistokles. The <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians loudly condemned him, and many of his <lb/>
            own countrymen, because of the enmity they bore him, <lb/>
            brought charges against him. He did not appear in <lb/>
            person at first, but answered these attacks by letters. In <lb/>
            these he told his accusers that he had always sought to <lb/>
            rule, and was not born to obey; so that he never would <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            sell himself and Greece to be a slave to the Persians. But <lb/>
            in spite of these arguments, his enemies prevailed upon <lb/>
            the Athenians to send men with orders to seize him, and <lb/>
            bring him to be tried by Greece.</p>
          <p>XXIV. He was apprised of this in time to take refuge in <lb/>
            Korkyra, a State which was under obligations to him. For <lb/>
            once, when Korkyra was at variance with Corinth, he had <lb/>
            been chosen to arbitrate between them, and had reconciled <lb/>
            them, giving as his award that the Corinthians were to pay <lb/>
            down twenty talents, and each State to have an equal share <lb/>
            in the city and island of Leucas, as being a colony from <lb/>
            both of them. From thence he fled to Epirus; but, being <lb/>
            still pursued by the Athenians and Lacedæmonians, he <lb/>
            adopted a desperate resolution. Admetus, the king of the <lb/>
            Molossians, had once made some request to the Athenians, <lb/>
            which Themistokles, who was then in the height of his <lb/>
            power, insultingly refused to grant. Admetus was deeply <lb/>
            incensed, and eager for vengeance; but now Themistokles <lb/>
            feared the fresh fury of his countrymen more than this old <lb/>
            grudge of the king's, put himself at his mercy, and became <lb/>
            a suppliant to Admetus in a novel and strange fashion; <lb/>
            for he lay down at the hearth of Admetus, holding that <lb/>
            prince's infant son, which is considered among the <lb/>
            Molossians to be the most solemn manner of becoming a <lb/>
            suppliant, and one which cannot be refused. Some say <lb/>
            that Phthia, the king's wife, suggested this posture to <lb/>
            Themistokles, and placed her infant on the hearth with <lb/>
            him; while others say that Admetus, in order to be able <lb/>
            to allege religious reasons for his refusal to give up <lb/>
            Themistokles to his pursuers, himself arranged the scene <lb/>
            with him. After this, Epikrates, of the township of <lb/>
            Acharnai, managed to convey his wife and children out of <lb/>
            Athens to join him, for which, we are told by Stesimbrotus, <lb/>
            Kimon subsequently had him condemned and executed. <lb/>
            But, singularly enough, afterwards Stesimbrotus either <lb/>
            forgets his wife and children, or makes Themistokles <lb/>
            forget them, when he says that he sailed to Sicily and <lb/>
            demanded the daughter of the despot Hiero in marriage, <lb/>
            promising that he would make all Greece obey him. As <lb/>
            Hiero rejected his proposals, he then went to Asia.</p>
          <p>XXV. Now it is not probable that this ever took place. <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            Theophrastus, in his treatise on monarchy, relates that <lb/>
            when Hiero sent race-horses to Olympia and pitched <lb/>
            a costly tent there, Themistokles said to the assembled <lb/>
            Greeks that they ought to destroy the despot's tent, and <lb/>
            not permit his horses to run. Thucydides too informs us <lb/>
            that he crossed to the Ægean sea, and set sail from Pydna, <lb/>
            none of his fellow-travellers knowing who he was until <lb/>
            the ship was driven by contrary winds to Naxos, which <lb/>
            was then being besieged by the Athenians. Then he be­ <lb/>
            came alarmed, and told the captain and the pilot who he <lb/>
            was, and, partly by entreaties, partly by threats that he <lb/>
            would denounce them to the Athenians, and say that they <lb/>
            well knew who he was, but were carrying him out of the <lb/>
            country for a bribe, he prevailed on them to hold on their <lb/>
            course to the coast of Asia.</p>
          <p>Of his property, much was concealed by his friends and <lb/>
            sent over to him in Asia; but what was confiscated to the <lb/>
            public treasury amounted, according to Theopompus, to a <lb/>
            hundred talents, and according to Theophrastus to eighty, <lb/>
            albeit Themistokles, before his entrance into political life, <lb/>
            did not possess property worth three talents.</p>
          <p>XXVI. When he sailed to K <unclear>y</unclear> me, he found that many of <lb/>
            the inhabitants of the Ionic coast were watching for an <lb/>
            opportunity to capture him, especially Ergoteles and <lb/>
            Pythodorus (for indeed, to men who cared not how they <lb/>
            made their money, he would have been a rich prize, as the <lb/>
            Persian king had offered a reward of two hundred talents <lb/>
            for him), he fled to Ægæ, a little Æolian city, where he <lb/>
            was known by no one except his friend Nikogenes, the <lb/>
            richest of all the Æolians, who was well known to the <lb/>
            Persians of the interior. In this man's house he lay con­ <lb/>
            cealed for some days. Here, after the feast which followed <lb/>
            a sacrifice, Olbius, who took charge of Nikogenes's children, <lb/>
            fell into a kind of inspired frenzy, and spoke the following <lb/>
            verse:</p>
          <p>" Night shall speak and give thee counsel, night shall <lb/>
            give thee victory." After this Themistokles dreamed a <lb/>
            dream. He thought that a snake was coiling itself upon <lb/>
            his belly and crawling up towards his throat. As soon as <lb/>
            it reached his throat, it became an eagle and flapped its <lb/>
            wings, lifted him up, and carried him a long distance, <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            until he saw a golden herald's staff. The eagle set him <lb/>
            down upon this securely, and he felt free from all terror <lb/>
            and anxiety. After this he was sent away by Nikogenes, <lb/>
            who made use of the following device. Most barbarian <lb/>
            nations, and the Persians especially, are violently jealous <lb/>
            in their treatment of women. They guard not only their <lb/>
            wives, but their purchased slaves and concubines, with the <lb/>
            greatest care, not permitting them to be seen by any one <lb/>
            out of doors, but when they are at home they lock them <lb/>
            up, and when they are on a journey they place them in <lb/>
            waggons with curtains all round them. Such a waggon <lb/>
            was prepared for Themistokles, and he travelled in it, his <lb/>
            escort telling all whom they met that they were conveying <lb/>
            a Greek lady from Ionia to one of the king's courtiers.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Thucydides and Charon of Lampsakus relate that <lb/>
            Xerxes was now dead, and that Themistokles gave himself <lb/>
            up to his son; but Ephorus, Deinon, Kleitarchus, Hera­ <lb/>
            kleides, and many others, say that it was to Xerxes <lb/>
            himself that he came. But the narrative of Thucydides <lb/>
            agrees better with the dates, although they are not <lb/>
            thoroughly settled.</p>
          <p>At this perilous crisis Themistokles first applied to <lb/>
            Artabanus, a chiliarch, or officer in command of a regiment <lb/>
            of a thousand men, whom he told that he was a Greek, <lb/>
            and that he wished to have an interview with the king <lb/>
            about matters of the utmost importance, and in which <lb/>
            the king was especially interested. He replied, " Stranger, <lb/>
            the customs of different races are different, and each has its <lb/>
            own standard of right and wrong; yet among all men it is <lb/>
            thought right to honour, admire, and to defend one's own <lb/>
            customs. Now we are told that you chiefly prize freedom <lb/>
            and equality ; we on the other hand think it the best of all <lb/>
            our laws to honour the king, and to worship him as we <lb/>
            should worship the statue of a god that preserves us all. <lb/>
            Wherefore if you are come with the intention of adopting <lb/>
            our customs, and of prostrating yourself before the king, you <lb/>
            may be permitted to see the king, and speak with him; but <lb/>
            if not, you must use some other person to communicate with <lb/>
            him; for it is not the custom for the king to converse <lb/>
            with any one who does not prostrate himself before him." <lb/>
            Themistokles, hearing this, said to him, " Artabanus, I am <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            come to increase the glory and power of the king, and will <lb/>
            both myself adopt your customs, since the god that has <lb/>
            exalted the Persians will have it so, and will also increase <lb/>
            the number of those who prostrate themselves before the <lb/>
            king. So let this be no impediment to the interview with <lb/>
            him which I desire." " Whom of the Greeks," asked <lb/>
            Artabanus, " are we to tell him is come ? for you do not <lb/>
            seem to have the manners of a man of humble station." <lb/>
            " No one," answered Themistokles, " must learn my name <lb/>
            before the king himself." This is the story which we are <lb/>
            told by Phanias. But Eratosthenes, in his treatise on <lb/>
            wealth, tells us also that Themistokles was introduced to <lb/>
            Artabanus by an Eretrian lady with whom the latter lived.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. When he was brought into the king's presence <lb/>
            he prostrated himself, and stood silent. The king then <lb/>
            told his interpreter to ask him who he was; and when the <lb/>
            interpreter had asked this question, he told him to answer, <lb/>
            " I am, 0 King, Themistokles the Athenian, an exile, a man <lb/>
            who has wrought much evil to the Persians, but more good <lb/>
            than evil, in that I stopped the pursuit when Greece was <lb/>
            safe, and I was able to do you a kindness as all was well at <lb/>
            home. In my present fallen fortunes I am prepared to be <lb/>
            grateful for any mark of favour you may show me, or to <lb/>
            deprecate your anger, should you bear a grudge against <lb/>
            me. Y ou may see, from the violence of my own countrymen <lb/>
            against me, how great were the benefits which I conferred <lb/>
            upon the Persians; so now use me rather as a means of <lb/>
            proving your magnanimity than of glutting your wrath. <lb/>
            Wherefore save me, your suppliant, and do not destroy <lb/>
            one who has become the enemy of Greece." Themistokles <lb/>
            also introduced a supernatural element into his speech by <lb/>
            relating the vision which he saw at the house of Nikogenes, <lb/>
            and also a prophecy which he received at the shrine of <lb/>
            Jupiter of Dodona, which bade him " go to the namesake of <lb/>
            the god," from which he concluded that the god sent him <lb/>
            to the king, because they were both great, and called kings. <lb/>
            To this speech the Persian king made no answer, although <lb/>
            he was astonished at his bold spirit; but in conversation <lb/>
            with his friends he spoke as though this were the greatest <lb/>
            possible piece of good fortune, and in his prayers begged <lb/>
            Arimanios to make his enemies ever continue to banish <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            their ablest men. He is said to have offered a sacrifice to <lb/>
            the gods and to have drunk wine at once, and during the <lb/>
            night in his soundest sleep he thrice cried out, " I have got <lb/>
            Themistokles the Athenian."</p>
          <p>XXIX. At daybreak he called together his friends <lb/>
            and sent for Themistokles, who augured nothing pleasant <lb/>
            from the insults and abuse which he received from the <lb/>
            people at the palace gates, when they heard his name. <lb/>
            Moreover Roxanes the chiliarch, as Themistokles passed <lb/>
            by him in silence into the king's presence, whispered, <lb/>
            " Thou subtle serpent of Greece, the king's good genius <lb/>
            has led thee hither." But when he was come before the <lb/>
            king and had prostrated himself a second time, the king <lb/>
            embraced him, and said in a friendly tone that he already <lb/>
            owed him two hundred talents: for as he had brought <lb/>
            himself he was clearly entitled to the reward which was <lb/>
            offered to any one else who would do so. He also promised <lb/>
            him much more than this, and encouraged him to speak at <lb/>
            length upon the affairs of Greece. To this Themistokles <lb/>
            answered, that human speech was like embroidered tapes­ <lb/>
            try, because when spread out it shows all its figures, but <lb/>
            when wrapped up it both conceals and spoils them, where­ <lb/>
            fore he asked for time. The king was pleased with his <lb/>
            simile, and bade him take what time he chose. He asked <lb/>
            for a year, during which he learned the Persian language <lb/>
            sufficiently to talk to the king without an interpreter. <lb/>
            This led the people to imagine that he discoursed about the <lb/>
            affairs of Greece; but many changes were made at that <lb/>
            time in the great officers of the court, and the nobles dis­ <lb/>
            liked Themistokles, imagining that he dared to speak about <lb/>
            them to the king. Indeed, he was honoured as no other <lb/>
            foreigner ever was, and went hunting with the king and <lb/>
            lived in his family circle, so that he came into the presence <lb/>
            of the king's mother, and became her intimate friend, and <lb/>
            at the king's command was instructed in the mysteries of <lb/>
            the Magi.</p>
          <p>VVhen Demaratus the Spartan was bidden to ask for a <lb/>
            boon, be asked to be allowed to drive through Sardis <lb/>
            wearing his tiara upright like that of the king. Mithro­ <lb/>
            paustes, the king's cousin, took hold of Demaratus by his <lb/>
            tiara, saying, u You have no brains for the king's tiara to <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            cover; do you think you would become Zeus if you were <lb/>
            given his thunderbolt to wield ?" The king was very <lb/>
            angry with Demaratus because of this request, but Themis­ <lb/>
            tokles by his entreaties restored him to favour. It is also <lb/>
            said that the later Persian kings, whose politics were more <lb/>
            mixed up with those of Greece, used to promise any Greek <lb/>
            whom they wished to desert to them that they would <lb/>
            treat him better than Themistokles. W e are told that <lb/>
            Themistokles himself, after he became a great man and <lb/>
            was courted by many, was seated one day at a magnificent <lb/>
            banquet, and said to his children, " My sons, we should <lb/>
            have been ruined if it had not been for our ruin." Most <lb/>
            writers agree that three cities, Magnesia, Lampsakus, and <lb/>
            Myous, were allotted to him for bread, wine, and meat. To <lb/>
            these Neanthes of Kyzikus and Phanias add two more, Per­ <lb/>
            kote and Palaiskepsis, which were to supply bedding and <lb/>
            clothing respectively.</p>
          <p>XXX. On one occasion, when he went down to the seaside <lb/>
            on some business connected with Greece, a Persian named <lb/>
            Epixyes, Satrap of Upper Phrygia, plotted his assassination. <lb/>
            He had long kept some Pisidians who were to kill him when <lb/>
            he passed the night in the town of Leontokophalos, which <lb/>
            means ' Lion's Head.' It is said that the mother of the <lb/>
            gods appeared to him while he was sleeping at noon and <lb/>
            said, " Themistokles, be late at Lion's Head, lest you fall <lb/>
            in with a lion. As a recompense for this warning, I <lb/>
            demand Mnesiptolema for my handmaid." Themistokles, <lb/>
            disturbed at this, after praying to the goddess, left the <lb/>
            highway and made a circuit by another road, avoiding that <lb/>
            place; when it was night he encamped in the open <lb/>
            country. As one of the sumpter cattle that carried his <lb/>
            tent had fallen into a river, Themistokles's servants hung <lb/>
            up the rich hangings, which were dripping with wet, in <lb/>
            order to dry them. The Pisidians meanwhile came up to <lb/>
            the camp with drawn swords, and, not clearly distinguish­ <lb/>
            ing in the moonlight the things hung out to dry, thought <lb/>
            that they must be the tent of Themistokles, and that they <lb/>
            would find him asleep within it. When they came close <lb/>
            to it and raised the hangings, the servants who were on <lb/>
            the watch fell upon them and seized them. Having thus <lb/>
            escaped from danger, he built a temple to Dindymene at <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            Magnesia to commemorate the appearance of the god­ <lb/>
            dess, and appointed his daughter Mnesiptolema to be its <lb/>
            priestess.</p>
          <p>XXXI. When he came to Sardis, he leisurely examined <lb/>
            the temples and the offerings which they contained, and in <lb/>
            the temple of the mother of the gods, he found a bronze <lb/>
            female figure called the Water-carrier, about two cubits <lb/>
            high, which he himself, when overseer of the water sup­ <lb/>
            ply of Athens, had made out of the fines imposed upon <lb/>
            those who took water illegally.</p>
          <p>Either feeling touched at the statue being a captive, or <lb/>
            else willing to show the Athenians how much power he <lb/>
            possessed in Persia, he proposed to the Satrap of Lydia to <lb/>
            send it back to Athens. This man became angry at his <lb/>
            demand, and said that he should write to the king, and tell <lb/>
            him of it. Themistokles in terror applied himself to the <lb/>
            harem of the Satrap, and by bribing the ladies there induced <lb/>
            them to pacify him, while he himself took care to be <lb/>
            more cautious in future, as he saw that he had to fear the <lb/>
            enmity of the native Persians. For this reason, Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus tells us, he ceased to wander about Asia, but <lb/>
            resided at Magnesia, where, receiving rich presents and <lb/>
            honoured equally with the greatest Persian nobles, he <lb/>
            lived for a long time in tranquillity ; for the king'is attention <lb/>
            was so entirely directed to the affairs of the provinces of <lb/>
            the interior that he had no leisure for operations against <lb/>
            Greece. But when Egypt revolted, and the Athenians <lb/>
            assisted it, and Greek triremes sailed as far as Cyprus and <lb/>
            Cilicia, and Kimon was master of the sea, then the king <lb/>
            determined to attack the Greeks, and prevent their de­ <lb/>
            velopment at his expense. Armies were put in motion, <lb/>
            generals were appointed, and frequent messages were sent <lb/>
            to Themistokles from the king, bidding him attack Greece <lb/>
            and fulfil his promises. Themistokles, unmoved by resent­ <lb/>
            ment against his countrymen, and uninfluenced by the <lb/>
            thought of the splendid position which he might occupy <lb/>
            as commander-in-chief, possibly too, thinking that his task <lb/>
            was an impossible one, as Greece possessed many great <lb/>
            generals, especially Kimon, who had a most brilliant <lb/>
            reputation, but chiefly because he would not soil his glory <lb/>
            and disgrace the trophies which he had won, determined, <note type="footnote"> p 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            as indeed was his best course, to bring his life to a fitting <lb/>
            close. He offered sacrifice to the gods, called his friends <lb/>
            together, and, having taken leave of them, drank bull's <lb/>
            blood, according to the most common tradition, but ac­ <lb/>
            cording to others, some quickly-operating poison, and <lb/>
            died at Magnesia in the sixty-fifth year of a life almost <lb/>
            entirely spent in great political and military employments.</p>
          <p>The King of Persia, when he heard of the manner of his <lb/>
            death and his reasons for dying, admired him more than <lb/>
            ever, and continued to treat his family and friends with <lb/>
            kindness.</p>
          <p>XXXIL Themistokles left five children, Neokles, Dickies, <lb/>
            Archeptolis, Polyeuktus, Kleophantus, by his first wife <lb/>
            Archippe, who was the daughter of Lysander, of the town­ <lb/>
            ship of Alopekai. Of these Kleophantus is mentioned by <lb/>
            Plato the philosopher as being an excellent horseman, <lb/>
            but otherwise worthless. Of the elder ones, Neokles was <lb/>
            bitten by a horse and died while still a child, and Diokles <lb/>
            was adopted by his grandfather Lysander. He also had <lb/>
            several daughters by his second wife, of whom Mnesi­ <lb/>
            ptolema married Archeptolis, her father's half-brother; <lb/>
            Italia married Panthoides of the island of Chios, and <lb/>
            Sybaris married Nikomedes, an Athenian. After Themis­ <lb/>
            tokles's death, his nephew Phrasikles sailed to Magnesia, <lb/>
            and with her brother's consent married Nicomache, and <lb/>
            also took charge of the youngest child, who was named <lb/>
            Asia.</p>
          <p>The people of Magnesia show a splendid tomb of Themis­ <lb/>
            tokles in their market-place; but with regard to the fate <lb/>
            of his remains we must pay no attention to Andokides, who <lb/>
            in his address to his friends, tells us that the Athenians <lb/>
            stole them and tore them to pieces, because he would <lb/>
            tell any falsehood to excite the hatred of the nobles against <lb/>
            the people. Phylarchus, too, writes his history in such <lb/>
            dramatic form that he all but resorts to the actual <lb/>
            machinery of the stage, bringing forward one Neokles, <lb/>
            and Demopolis as the children of Themistokles to make a <lb/>
            touching scene, which anyone can see is untrue. Diodorus <lb/>
            the topographer, in his treatise ' On Tombs' says, more <lb/>
            as a conjecture than as knowing it for a fact, that in the <lb/>
            great harbour of Peiraeus a kind of elbow juts out from <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            the promontory of Alkimus, and that when one sails past <lb/>
            this, going inwards, where the sea is most sheltered, there <lb/>
            is a large foundation, and upon it the tomb of Themistokles, <lb/>
            shaped like an altar. It is thought that the comic poet <lb/>
            Plato alludes to this in the following verses: <lb/>
            " By the sea's margin, by the watery strand, <lb/>
            Thy monument, Themistokles, shall stand; <lb/>
            By this directed to thy native shore <lb/>
            The merchant shall convey his freighted store; <lb/>
            And when our fleets are summoned to the fight, <lb/>
            Athens shall conquer with thy tomb in sight."</p>
          <p>The descendants of Themistokles are given certain <lb/>
            privileges at Magnesia even to the present day, for I know <lb/>
            that Themistokles, an Athenian, my friend and fellow- <lb/>
            student in the school of Ammonius the philosopher, enjoyed <lb/>
            them.</p>

            LIFE OF CAMILLUS.</p>
          <p>I. THE strangest fact in the life of Furius Camillus is <lb/>
            that, although he was a most successful general and won <lb/>
            great victories, though he was five times appointed dictator, <lb/>
            triumphed four times, and was called the second founder <lb/>
            of Rome, yet he never once was consul. The reason of <lb/>
            this is to be found inthe political condition of Rome at <lb/>
            that time; for the people, being at variance with the <lb/>
            senate, refused to elect consuls, and chose military <lb/>
            tribunes instead, who, although they had full consular <lb/>
            powers, yet on account of their number were less offensive <lb/>
            to the people than consuls. To have affairs managed by <lb/>
            six men instead of two appears to have been a consolation <lb/>
            to those who had suffered from the arbitrary rule of a few. <lb/>
            It was during this period that Camillus reached the <lb/>
            height of power and glory, and yet he would not become <lb/>
            consul against the will of the people, although several <lb/>
            occasions occurred when he might have been elected, but <lb/>
            in his various appointments he always contrived, even <lb/>
            when he had sole command, to share his power with <lb/>
            others, while even when he had colleagues he kept <lb/>
            all the glory for himself. His moderation prevented any <lb/>
            one from grudging him power, while His successes were <lb/>
            due to his genius, in which he confessedly surpassed all <lb/>
            his countrymen.</p>
          <p>II. The family of the Furii was not a very illustrious <lb/>
            one before Camillus gained glory in the great battle with <lb/>
            the Æqui and Volsci, where he served under the dictator <lb/>
            Postumius Tubertus. Riding out before the rest of the <lb/>
            army, he was struck in the thigh by a dart, but tore it <lb/>
            out, assailed the bravest of the enemy, and put them to <lb/>
            flight. After this, amongst other honours he was ap­ <lb/>
            pointed <unclear>cenuor</unclear>, an office of great dignity at that time. <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            One admirable measure is recorded of his censorship, that <lb/>
            by arguments and threatening them with fines he <lb/>
            persuaded the unmarried citizens to marry the widow <lb/>
            women, whose number was very great on account of the <lb/>
            wars. Another measure to which he was forced was that <lb/>
            of taxing orphans, who had hitherto been exempt from <lb/>
            taxation. This was rendered necessary by the constant <lb/>
            campaigns which were carried on at a great expense, and <lb/>
            more especially by the siege of Veil. Some call the <lb/>
            inhabitants of this city Veientani. It was the bulwark <lb/>
            of Etruria, possessing as many fighting men as Rome <lb/>
            itself; the citizens were rich, luxurious, and extravagant <lb/>
            in their habits, and fought bravely many times for honour <lb/>
            and for power against the Romans. At this period, <lb/>
            having been defeated in several great battles, the people <lb/>
            of Veii had given up any schemes of conquest, but had <lb/>
            built strong and high walls, filled their city with arms <lb/>
            and provisions, and all kinds of material of war, and <lb/>
            fearlessly endured a siege, which was long, no doubt, <lb/>
            but which became no less irksome and difficult to the <lb/>
            besiegers. Accustomed as the Romans had been to make <lb/>
            short campaigns in summer weather, and to spend their <lb/>
            winters at home, they were now for the first time corn <lb/>
            polled by their tribunes to establish forts and entrench <lb/>
            their camp, and pass both summer and winter in the <lb/>
            enemy's country for seven years in succession. The <lb/>
            generals were complained of, and as they seemed to be <lb/>
            carrying on the siege remissly, they were removed, and <lb/>
            others appointed, among them Camillus, who was then <lb/>
            tribune for the second time. But he effected nothing in <lb/>
            the siege at that time, because he was sent to fight the <lb/>
            Faliscans and Capenates, who had insulted the Roman <lb/>
            territory throughout the war with Veil, when the Roman <lb/>
            army was engaged elsewhere, but were now driven by <lb/>
            Camillus with great loss to the shelter of their city walls.</p>
          <p>III. Alter this, while the war was at its height, much <lb/>
            alarm was caused by the strange phenomenon seen at the <lb/>
            Alban lake, which could not be accounted for on ordinary <lb/>
            physical principles. The season was autumn, and the <lb/>
            summer had not been remarkable for rain or for <unclear>molst</unclear> <lb/>
            winds, so that many of the streams and marshes in Italy <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            were quite dried up, and others held out with difficulty, <lb/>
            while the rivers, as is usual in summer, were very low and <lb/>
            deeply sunk in their bed. But the Alban lake, which is <lb/>
            self-contained, lying as it does surrounded by fertile hills, <lb/>
            began for no reason, except it may be the will of Heaven, <lb/>
            to increase in volume and to encroach upon the hillsides <lb/>
            near it, until it reached their very tops, rising quietly <lb/>
            and without disturbance. At first the portent only <lb/>
            amazed the shepherds and herdsmen of the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood ; but when the lake by the weight of its waters <lb/>
            broke through the thin isthmus of land which restrained <lb/>
            it, and poured down in a mighty stream through the <lb/>
            fertile plains below to the sea, then not only the <lb/>
            Romans, but all the people of Italy, thought it a portent <lb/>
            of the gravest character. Much talk about it took place <lb/>
            in the camp before Veil, so that the besieged also learned <lb/>
            what was happening at the lake.</p>
          <p>IV. As always happens during a long siege, where there <lb/>
            are frequent opportunities of intercourse between the two <lb/>
            parties, one of the Romans had become intimate with a <lb/>
            citizen of Veil, who was learned in legendary lore, and <lb/>
            was even thought to have supernatural sources of infor­ <lb/>
            mation. When this man heard of the overflowing of the <lb/>
            lake, his Roman friend observed that he was overjoyed, <lb/>
            and laughed at the idea of the siege being successful. <lb/>
            The Roman told him that these were not the only por­ <lb/>
            tents which troubled the Romans at the present time, but <lb/>
            that there were others stranger than this, about which he <lb/>
            should like to consult him, and, if possible, save himself <lb/>
            in the common ruin of his country. The man eagerly <lb/>
            attended to his discourse, imagining that he was about <lb/>
            to hear some great secrets. The Roman thus decoyed him <lb/>
            away farther and farther from the city gate, when he <lb/>
            suddenly seized him and lifted him from the ground. <lb/>
            Being the stronger man, and being assisted by several <lb/>
            soldiers from the camp, he overpowered him, and brought <lb/>
            him before the generals. Here the man, seeing that there <lb/>
            was no escape, and that no one can resist his destiny, <lb/>
            told them of the ancient oracles about his city, how it <lb/>
            could not be taken until its enemies drove back the <lb/>
            waters of the Alban lake, and prevented its joining the <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            sea. When the senate heard this they were at a loss <lb/>
            what to do, and determined to send an embassy to Delphi <lb/>
            to enquire of the God. The embassy consisted of men of <lb/>
            mark and importance, being Licinius Cossus, Valerius <lb/>
            Potitus, and Fabius Ambustus. After a prosperous <lb/>
            journey they returned with a response from Apollo, <lb/>
            pointing out certain ceremonies which had been neglected <lb/>
            in the feast of the Latin games, and bidding them, if <lb/>
            possible, force the waters of the Alban lake away from <lb/>
            the sea into its ancient course, or, if this could not be <lb/>
            done, to divide the stream by canals and watercourses, <lb/>
            and so to expend it in the plain. When the answer was <lb/>
            brought back, the priests took the necessary steps about <lb/>
            the sacrifices, while the people turned their attention to <lb/>
            the diversion of the water.</p>
          <p>V. In the tenth year of the war, the Senate recalled all <lb/>
            the rest of the generals, and made Camillus Dictator. He <lb/>
            chose Cornelius Scipio to be his Master of the Knights, and <lb/>
            made a vow to the gods, that, if he succeeded in bringing <lb/>
            the war to a glorious close, he would celebrate a great <lb/>
            festival, and build a shrine to the goddess whom the <lb/>
            Romans call Mater Matuta. This goddess, from the rites <lb/>
            with which she is worshipped, one would imagine to be <lb/>
            the same as the Greek Leukothea. For they bring a slave <lb/>
            girl into the temple and beat her, and then drive her out; <lb/>
            they take their brothers' children in their arms in pre­ <lb/>
            ference to their own, and generally their ceremonies seem <lb/>
            to allude to the nursing of Bacchus, and to the misfortunes <lb/>
            which befell Ino because of her husband's concubine. <lb/>
            After this, Camillus invaded the Faliscan territory, and in <lb/>
            a great battle overthrew that people, and the Capenates <lb/>
            who came to their assistance. Next, he turned his atten­ <lb/>
            tion to the siege of Veil, and, perceiving that it would be <lb/>
            a difficult matter to take the city by assault, he ordered <lb/>
            mines to be dug, as the ground near the walls was easily <lb/>
            worked, and the mines could be sunk to a sufficient depth <lb/>
            to escape the notice of the besieged. As this work suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded to his wish, he made a demonstration above ground <lb/>
            to call the enemy to the walls and distract their attention, <lb/>
            while others made their way unperceived through the <lb/>
            mine to the Temple of Juno in the citadel, the largest and <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            most sacred edifice in the city. Here, it is said, was the <lb/>
            King of the Veientines, engaged in sacrificing. The <lb/>
            soothsayer inspected the entrails, and cried with a loud <lb/>
            voice, that the goddess would give the victory to whoever <lb/>
            offered that victim. The Romans in the mine, hearing <lb/>
            these words, quickly tore up the floor, and burst through <lb/>
            it with shouts and rattling arms. The enemy fled in <lb/>
            terror, and they seized the victims and carried them to <lb/>
            Camillus. However, this story sounds rather fabulous.</p>
          <p>The city was stormed, and the Romans carried off an <lb/>
            enormous mass of plunder. Camillus, who viewed them <lb/>
            from the citadel, at first stood weeping, but when con­ <lb/>
            gratulated by the bystanders, raised his hands to heaven <lb/>
            and said, " Great Jupiter, and all ye other gods, that see all <lb/>
            good and evil deeds alike, ye know that it is not in un­ <lb/>
            righteous conquest, but in self-defence, that the Romans <lb/>
            have taken this city of their lawless enemies. If," he <lb/>
            continued, "there awaits us any reverse of fortune to <lb/>
            counterbalance this good luck, I pray that it may fall, not <lb/>
            upon the city or army of Rome, but, as lightly as may be, <lb/>
            upon my own head." After these words he turned round <lb/>
            to the right, as is the Roman habit after prayer, and while <lb/>
            turning, stumbled and fell. All those present were terri­ <lb/>
            fied at the omen, but he recovered himself, saying that, as <lb/>
            he had prayed, he had received a slight hurt to temper his <lb/>
            great good fortune.</p>
          <p>VI. When the city was sacked, he determined to send <lb/>
            the statue of Juno to Rome, according to his vow. When <lb/>
            workmen were assembled for this purpose, he offered <lb/>
            sacrifice, and prayed to the goddess to look kindly on his <lb/>
            efforts, and to graciously take up her abode among the <lb/>
            gods of Rome. It is said that the statue answered that it <lb/>
            wished to do so, and approved of his proceedings. But <lb/>
            Livy tells us that Camillus offered his prayers while <lb/>
            touching the statue, and that some of the bystanders said, <lb/>
            " She consents, and is willing to come." However, those <lb/>
            who insist on the supernatural form of the story have one <lb/>
            great argument in their favour, in the marvellous fortune <lb/>
            of Rome, which never could from such small beginnings <lb/>
            have reached such a pitch of glory and power without <lb/>
            many direct manifestations of the favour of Heaven. <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            Moreover, other appearances of the same kind are to be <lb/>
            compared with it, such as that statues have often been <lb/>
            known to sweat, have been heard to groan, and have even <lb/>
            turned away and shut their eyes, as has been related by <lb/>
            many historians before our own time. And I have heard <lb/>
            of many miraculous occurrences even at the present day, <lb/>
            resting on evidence which cannot be lightly impugned. <lb/>
            However, the weakness of human nature makes it equally <lb/>
            dangerous to put too much faith in such matters or to <lb/>
            entirely disbelieve them, as the one leads to superstition <lb/>
            and folly, and the other to neglect and contempt of the­ <lb/>
            gods. Our best course is caution, and the " golden mean."</p>
          <p>VII. Camillus, either because he was elated by the <lb/>
            magnificence of his exploit in having taken a city as large <lb/>
            as Rome after a ten years' siege, or else because he had <lb/>
            been so nattered by his admirers that his pride overcame <lb/>
            his sober judgment, conducted his triumph with great <lb/>
            ostentation, especially in driving through Rome in a chariot <lb/>
            drawn by four whitehorses, which never was done by any <lb/>
            general before or since, for this carriage is thought to be <lb/>
            sacred to Jupiter, the king and father of the gods. The <lb/>
            citizens, unaccustomed to splendour, were displeased with <lb/>
            him for this, and their dislike was increased by his oppo-­ <lb/>
            sition to the law for a redistribution of the people. The <lb/>
            tri un proposed that the Senate and people should be­ <lb/>
            divided into two parts,one of which should stay at Rome <lb/>
            and the other remove to the captured city, because they <lb/>
            would be more powerful if they possessed two great cities, <lb/>
            instead of one, and held the land in common, still remain­ <lb/>
            ing one nation. The lower classes, which were numerous <lb/>
            and poor, eagerly took up the scheme, and continually <lb/>
            clamoured round the speakers at the rostra, demanding to <lb/>
            have it put to the vote. But the Senate and the nobles <lb/>
            thought it wnR not a redistribution ,but the <lb/>
            destruction of Rome which the tribunes were demanding, <lb/>
            and in their anger rallied round Camillus. He, fearing to <lb/>
            have a contest on the matter, kept putting off the people <lb/>
            and inventing reasons for delay, so as to prevent the law <lb/>
            being brought forward to be voted upon. This increased <lb/>
            his unpopularity ; but the greatest and most obvious reason <lb/>
            for the dislike which the people bore him arose from his <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            demand for the tenth part of the spoils; very naturally, <lb/>
            though perhaps he scarcely deserved it. On his way to <lb/>
            Veil it seems he had made a vow, that if he took the city <lb/>
            he would dedicate the tenth part of the spoil to Apollo. <lb/>
            But when the city was taken and plundered, he either was <lb/>
            unwilling to interfere with his countrymen, or else forgot <lb/>
            his vow, and allowed them to enrich themselves with the <lb/>
            booty. Afterwards, when he had laid down his dictator­ <lb/>
            ship, he brought the matter before the Senate, and the <lb/>
            soothsayers declared that the victims for sacrifice showed, <lb/>
            when inspected, that the gods were angry and must be <lb/>
            propitiated.</p>
          <p>VIII. The Senate decreed, not that the plunder should <lb/>
            be given up, for that would have been scarcely possible to <lb/>
            carry out, but that those who had taken any should be <lb/>
            put on their oath, and contribute a tenth part of its value. <lb/>
            This measure bore very hardly upon the soldiers, poor hard- <lb/>
            working men, who were now compelled to repay so large <lb/>
            a proportion of what they had earned and spent. Camillus <lb/>
            was clamorously assailed by them, and, having no better <lb/>
            excuse to put forward, made the extraordinary statement <lb/>
            that he had forgotten his vow when the city was plundered. <lb/>
            The people angrily said that he had vowed to offer up a <lb/>
            tithe of the enemy's property, but that he really was <lb/>
            taking a tithe from the citizens instead. However, all the <lb/>
            contributions were made, and it was determined that with <lb/>
            them a golden bowl should be made and sent to Apollo at <lb/>
            Delphi. There was a scarcity of gold in the city, and <lb/>
            while the government were deliberating how it was to be <lb/>
            obtained, the matrons held a meeting among themselves, and <lb/>
            offered their golden ornaments to make the offering, which <lb/>
            came to eight talents' weight of gold. The Senate rewarded <lb/>
            them by permitting them to have a funeral oration pro­ <lb/>
            nounced over their graves the same as men; for hitherto <lb/>
            it had not been customary at Rome to make any speeches <lb/>
            at the funerals of women. They also chose three of the <lb/>
            noblest citizens to travel with the offering, and sent them <lb/>
            in a well-manned ship of war, splendidly equipped. Both <lb/>
            storms and calms at sea are said to be dangerous, and they <lb/>
            chanced on this occasion to come very near destruction, <lb/>
            and miraculously escaped, for in a calm off the Æolian <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            Islands they were assailed by Liparian triremes, who took <lb/>
            them for pirates. At their earnest entreaty these people <lb/>
            forbore to run down their vessel, but took it in tow and <lb/>
            brought it into their harbour, where they treated it as a <lb/>
            piratical craft, and put up the crew and the property on <lb/>
            board for sale by public auction. With great difficulty, <lb/>
            by the goodness and influence of one man, Timesitheos, a <lb/>
            general, they obtained their release, and were allowed to <lb/>
            proceed. Timesitheos even launched some ships of his <lb/>
            own, with which he escorted them to Delphi, where he <lb/>
            also took part in the ceremony of consecration. In return <lb/>
            for his services, as was only just, he received special <lb/>
            honours at Rome.</p>
          <p>IX. The tribunes of the people again began to agitate <lb/>
            about the redistribution of land and occupation of Veii, <lb/>
            but a war with the Faliscans gave the leading men a <lb/>
            seasonable opportunity to elect magistrates after their own <lb/>
            hearts for the coming year. Camillus was appointed <lb/>
            military tribune, with five others, as it was thought that <lb/>
            the State req uired ageneral of tried experience. At the <lb/>
            decree of the Senate, Camillus raised a force and invaded <lb/>
            the Faliscan territory. He now besieged Falerii, a strong <lb/>
            city well provided with all munitions of war, which he <lb/>
            considered it would be a work of no small time and labour <lb/>
            to take; but he was desirous of employing the people in a <lb/>
            long siege, to prevent their having leisure for factious <lb/>
            proceedings at home. This was ever the policy of the <lb/>
            Romans, to work off the elements of internal strife in <lb/>
            attacks on their neighbours.</p>
          <p>X. The Faliscans thought so little of the siege, from the <lb/>
            strength of their defences, that, except when on duty on <lb/>
            the walls, they used to walk about their city in their <lb/>
            ordinary dress, and their children were sent regularly to <lb/>
            school, and used to be taken by their master to walk and <lb/>
            take exercise outside the walls. For the Faliscans, like <lb/>
            the Greeks, had one common school, as they wished all <lb/>
            their children to be brought up together. The school­ <lb/>
            master determined to betray these boys to the enemy, and <lb/>
            led them outside the walls for exercise every day, and then <lb/>
            led them back again. By this means he gradually <lb/>
            accustomed them to going out as if there was no danger, <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            until finally he took all the boys and handed them over to <lb/>
            the Roman pickets, bidding them bring him to Camillus. <lb/>
            When he was brought before him he said that he was a <lb/>
            schoolmaster, that he preferred the favour of Camillus to <lb/>
            his duty, and that he came to hand over to him the city of <lb/>
            Falerii in the persons of these boys.</p>
          <p>Camillus was very much shocked. He said that war is <lb/>
            indeed harsh, and is carried on by savage and unrighteous <lb/>
            means, but yet there are laws of war which are observed <lb/>
            by good men, and one ought not so much to strive for <lb/>
            victory, as to forego advantages gained by wicked and <lb/>
            villainous means: thus a truly great general ought to <lb/>
            succeed by his own warlike virtues, not by the baseness <lb/>
            of others.</p>
          <p>Having spoken thus, he ordered his slaves to tear the <lb/>
            schoolmaster's clothes, tie his hands behind his back, and <lb/>
            give the boys sticks and scourges with which to drive <lb/>
            him back to the city. The Faliscans had just discovered <lb/>
            the treachery of their schoolmaster, and, as may be expected, <lb/>
            the whole city was filled with mourning at such a <lb/>
            calamity, men and women together running in confusion <lb/>
            to the gates and walls of the city, when the boys drove in <lb/>
            their schoolmaster with blows and insults, calling Camillus <lb/>
            their saviour, their father, and their god. Not only those <lb/>
            who were parents, but all the citizens were struck with <lb/>
            admiration at the goodness of Camillus. They at once <lb/>
            assembled, and despatched ambassadors, putting themselves <lb/>
            unreservedly in his hands. These men Camillus sent on <lb/>
            to Rome, where they stated before the Senate, that the <lb/>
            Romans, by preferring justice to conquest, had taught <lb/>
            them to prefer submission to freedom, although they did <lb/>
            not think that they fell short of the Romans in strength so <lb/>
            much as in virtue. The Senate referred the ambassadors <lb/>
            to Camillus for their first answer; and he, after receiving <lb/>
            a contribution in money, and having made a treaty of <lb/>
            alliance with the Faliscans, drew off his forces.</p>
          <p>XI. But the soldiers, who had been looking forward to <lb/>
            plundering Falerii, when they returned to Rome empty <lb/>
            handed, abused Camillus to the other citizens, saying that <lb/>
            he was a hater of the people, and grudged poor men a <lb/>
            chance of enriching themselves. When the tribunes re­ <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            introduced the proposal of redistribution of the land, and <lb/>
            removing half the city to Veil, Camillus openly, without <lb/>
            caring how unpopular he became, opposed the measure. <lb/>
            The people, sorely against their will, gave up the measure, <lb/>
            but hated Camillus so fiercely that even his domestic <lb/>
            afflictions (for he had just lost one of his two sons by sickness) <lb/>
            could not move them to pity. Being of a kind and loving <lb/>
            nature, he was dreadfully cast down at this misfortune, <lb/>
            and spent all his time within doors mourning with the <lb/>
            women of his family, while his enemies were preparing <lb/>
            an impeachment against im.</p>
          <p>XII. His accuser was Lucius Apuleius, and the charge <lb/>
            brought against him was embezzlement of the spoils of <lb/>
            Etruria. He was even said to have in his possession some <lb/>
            brazen gates which were taken in that country. The <lb/>
            people were much excited against him, and it was clear <lb/>
            that, whatever the charge against him might be, they would <lb/>
            condemn him. Consequently he assembled his friends and <lb/>
            comrades, who were a great number in all, and begged <lb/>
            them not to permit him to be ruined by false accusations, <lb/>
            and made a laughing-stock to his enemies. But when his <lb/>
            friends, after consulting together, answered that they did <lb/>
            not think that they could prevent his being condemned, <lb/>
            but that they would assist him to pay any fine that might <lb/>
            be imposed, he, unable to bear such treatment, determined <lb/>
            in a rage to leave Rome and go into exile. He embraced <lb/>
            his wife and son, and walked from his house silently as far <lb/>
            as the gate of the city. There he turned back, and, <lb/>
            stretching out his hands towards the Capitol, prayed to <lb/>
            the gods that, if he was driven out of Rome unjustly <lb/>
            by the insolence and hatred of the people, the Romans <lb/>
            might soon repent of their conduct to him, and appear <lb/>
            before the world begging him to return, and longing for <lb/>
            their Camillus back again.</p>
          <p>XIII. Like Achilles, he thus cursed his countrymen <lb/>
            and left them. His cause was undefended, and in his <lb/>
            absence he was condemned to pay a fine of fifteen thousand <lb/>
            aMes, which in Greek money is fifteen hundred drachmae, <lb/>
            for the as was the Roman coin at that time, and con­ <lb/>
            sequently ten copper ases were called a denarius.</p>
          <p>Every Roman believes that the prayers of Camillus <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            were quickly heard by Justice, and that a terrible retribu­ <lb/>
            tiun was exacted for his wrongs, which filled all men'a <lb/>
            mouths at that time; so terrible a fate befell Rome, with <lb/>
            such destruction, danger, and disgrace, whether it arose <lb/>
            from mere chance, or whether it be the office of some god <lb/>
            to punish those who requite virtue with ingratitude.</p>
          <p>XIV. The first omen of impending evil was the death <lb/>
            of Julius the Censor; for the Romans reverence theoffice <lb/>
            of censor, and account it sacred. Another omen was <lb/>
            that, a short time before Camillus went into exile, one <lb/>
            Marcus Cædicius, a man of no particular note, and not <lb/>
            even a senator, but a thoroughly respectable man, corn­ <lb/>
            niunicated a matter of some importance to the tribunes of <lb/>
            the people. He said that the night before he had been <lb/>
            walking along what is called the New Road, when some <lb/>
            one called him by name. He turned round and could see <lb/>
            no one, but heard a voice louder than man's say, "Go, <lb/>
            Marcus Cædicius, tell the government early in the morn­ <lb/>
            ing that in a short time they may expect the Gauls." <lb/>
            When the tribunes of the people heard this they laughed <lb/>
            him to scorn, and shortly afterwards Camillus left the <lb/>
            city.</p>
          <p>X V. The Gaulsarea, people -of the Celtic race, and are <lb/>
            said to have become too numerous for their own country, <lb/>
            and consequently to have left it to search for some other <lb/>
            land to dwell in. As they consisted of a large multitude <lb/>
            -of young warriors, they started in two bodies, one of which <lb/>
            went towards the northern ocean, and, passing the Rhipæan <lb/>
            mountains, settled in the most distant part of Europe. <lb/>
            The other body established themselves between the <lb/>
            Pyrenees and the Alps, and for a long time dwelt near <lb/>
            the Senones and Celtorii. At last they tasted wine, which <lb/>
            was then for the first time brought thither out of Italy. <lb/>
            In an ecstasy of delight at the drink they wildly snatched <lb/>
            up their arms, took their families with them, and rushed <lb/>
            to the Alps in search of the country which produced such <lb/>
            fruits as this, considering all other countries to be savage <lb/>
            and uncultivated. The man who first introduced wine <lb/>
            among them and encouraged them to proceed to Italy was <lb/>
            said to be one Aruns, an Etruscan of some note, who, <lb/>
            though a well-meaning man, had met with the following <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            misfortune. He had been left guardian to an orphan <lb/>
            named Lucumo, one of the richest and handsomest of his <lb/>
            countrymen. This boy lived in the house of Aruns from <lb/>
            his childhood, and when he grew up he would not leave <lb/>
            it, but pretended to delight in his society. It was long <lb/>
            before Aruns discovered that Lucumo had debauched his <lb/>
            wife, and that their passion was mutual; but at length <lb/>
            they were unable any longer to conceal their intrigue, <lb/>
            and the youth openly attempted to carry off the woman <lb/>
            from her husband. He went to law, but was unable to <lb/>
            contend with the numerous friends and great wealth of <lb/>
            Lucumo, and so left the country. Hearing about the <lb/>
            Gauls, he went to them and incited them to invade Italy.</p>
          <p>XVI. They immediately made themselves masters of <lb/>
            the country, which reaches from the Alps down to the sea <lb/>
            on both sides of Italy, which in ancient times belonged to <lb/>
            the Etruscans, as we see by the names, for the upper sea <lb/>
            is called the Adriatic from Adria, an Etruscan city, and <lb/>
            the lower is called the Etruscan Sea. It is a thickly <lb/>
            wooded country, with plenty of pasturage, and well <lb/>
            watered. At that period it contained eighteen fair and <lb/>
            large cities, with a thriving commercial population. The <lb/>
            Gauls took these cities, drove out their inhabitants, and <lb/>
            occupied them themselves. This, however, took place <lb/>
            some time previously to our story.</p>
          <p>XVII. The Gauls at this time marched against the <lb/>
            Etruscan city of Clusium and besieged it. The inhabitants <lb/>
            appealed to the Romans to send ambassadors and letters <lb/>
            to the barbarians, and they sent three of the Fabian <lb/>
            family, men of the first importance in Rome. They were <lb/>
            well received, because of the name of Rome, by the Gauls, <lb/>
            who desisted from their siege and held a conference with <lb/>
            them. The Romans inquired what wrong the Gauls had <lb/>
            suffered from the people of Clusium that they should <lb/>
            attack their city. To this Brennus, the king of the <lb/>
            Gauls, answered with a laugh, " The people of Clusium <lb/>
            wrong us by holding a large territory, although they can <lb/>
            only inhabit and cultivate a small one, while they will <lb/>
            not give a share of it to us, who are numerous and poor. <lb/>
            You Romans were wronged in just the same way in old <lb/>
            times by the people of Alba, and Fidenae, and Ardea, and <note type="footnote"> u </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            at the present day by the Veientines and Catenatos, and <lb/>
            by many of the Faliscans and Volscians. You make <lb/>
            campaigns against these people if they will not share <lb/>
            their good things with you, you sell them for slaves <lb/>
            and plunder their territory, and destroy their cities; and <lb/>
            in this you do nothing wrong, but merely obey the most­ <lb/>
            ancient of all laws, that the property of the weak belongs <lb/>
            to the strong, a law which prevails among the gods on <lb/>
            the one hand, and even among wild beasts, amongst <lb/>
            whom the stronger always encroach upon the weaker <lb/>
            ones. So now cease to pity the besieged men of Clusium, <lb/>
            for fear you should teach the Gauls to become good- <lb/>
            N natured and pitiful towards the nations that have been <lb/>
            wronged by the Romans."</p>
          <p>^ This speech showed the Romans that Brennus had no <lb/>
            thought of coming to terms, and they in consequence <lb/>
            went into Clusium and encouraged the inhabitants to <lb/>
            attack the barbarians under their guidance, either because <lb/>
            they wished to make trial of the valour of the Gauls, or <lb/>
            to make a display of their own. The people of Clusium <lb/>
            made a sally, and a battle took place near their wall. In <lb/>
            this one of the Fabii, Quintus Ambustus by name, was on <lb/>
            horseback, and rode to attack a fine powerful Gaul who <lb/>
            was riding far in advance of the rest. At first the Roman <lb/>
            was not recognised because the fight was sharp, and the <lb/>
            flashing of his arms prevented his face being clearly seen. <lb/>
            But when he slew his antagonist and jumped down from <lb/>
            his horse to strip his body of its spoils, Brennus recognised <lb/>
            him, and called the gods to witness his violation of the <lb/>
            common law of all nations, in coming to them as an <lb/>
            ambassador and fighting against them as an enemy. He <lb/>
            immediately put a stop to the battle and took no further <lb/>
            heed of the people of Clusium, but directed his army <lb/>
            against Rome. However, as he did not wish it to be <lb/>
            thought that the bad conduct of the Somanspleased the <lb/>
            Gauls, who only wanted apretext for hostilities, he sent <lb/>
            and demanded that Fabius should be delivered up to him <lb/>
            to be punished, and at the same time led his army slowly <lb/>
            forwards.</p>
          <p>XVIII. At Rome the Senate was called together, and <lb/>
            many blamed Fabius, while those priests who are called <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            Feciales urged the Senate in the name of religion to throw <lb/>
            the whole blame of what had happened upon one guilty <lb/>
            head, and, by delivering him up, to clear the rest of the <lb/>
            city from sharing his guilt. These Feciales were insti­ <lb/>
            tuted by the mildest and justest of the kings of Rome, <lb/>
            Numa Pompilius, to be guardians of peace, and examiners <lb/>
            of the reasons which justify a nation in going to war. <lb/>
            However the Senate referred the matter to the people, and <lb/>
            when the priests repeated their charges against Fabius <lb/>
            before them, the people so despised and slighted religion <lb/>
            as to appoint Fabius and his brothers military tribunes. <lb/>
            The Gauls, when they heard this, were enraged, and hur­ <lb/>
            ried on, disregarding everything but speed. The nations <lb/>
            through which they passed, terrified at their glancing <lb/>
            arms and their strength and courage, thought that their <lb/>
            land was indeed lost and that their cities would at once be <lb/>
            taken, but to their wonder and delight the Gauls did them <lb/>
            no hurt, and took nothing from their fields, but marched <lb/>
            close by their cities, calling out that they were marching <lb/>
            against Rome, and were at war with the Romans only, and <lb/>
            held all other men to be their friends. To meet this <lb/>
            impetuous rush, the military tribunes led out the Romans, <lb/>
            who, in numbers indeed were quite a match for the Gauls, <lb/>
            for they amounted to no less than forty thousand heavy- <lb/>
            armed men, but for the most part untrained and serving <lb/>
            for the first time.</p>
          <p>Besides this disadvantage, they neglected the duties -of­ <lb/>
            religion,for they neither made the usual sacrifices nor <lb/>
            consulted the soothsayers. Confusion also was produced <lb/>
            by the number of commanders, though frequently before <lb/>
            this, in much less important campaigns, they had chosen <lb/>
            single generals, whom they called dictators, as they knew <lb/>
            that nothing is so important at a dangerous crisis as that <lb/>
            all should unanimously and in good order obey the com­ <lb/>
            mands of one irresponsible chief. And the unfair treat­ <lb/>
            ment which Camillus had received now bore disastrous <lb/>
            fruits, for no man dared to use authority except to flatter <lb/>
            and gain the favour of the people.</p>
          <p>They proceeded about eleven miles from the city, and <lb/>
            halted for the night on the banks of the river Allia, <lb/>
            which joins the Tiber not far from where their camp was <note type="footnote"> <unclear>Q</unclear> 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            pitched. Here the barbarians appeared, and, after an <lb/>
            unskilfully managed battle, the want of discipline of the <lb/>
            Romans caused their ruin. The Gauls drove the left wing <lb/>
            into the river and destroyed it, but the right of the army, <lb/>
            which took refuge in the hills to avoid the enemy's charge <lb/>
            on level ground, suffered less, and most of them reached <lb/>
            the city safely. The rest, who survived after the enemy <lb/>
            were weary of slaughter, took refuge at Veil, imagining <lb/>
            that all was over with Rome.</p>
          <p>XIX. This battle took place about the summer solstice <lb/>
            at the time of full moon, on the very day on which in <lb/>
            former times the great disaster betel the Fabii, when three <lb/>
            hundred of that race were slain by the Etruscans. But <lb/>
            this defeat wiped out the memory of the former one, and <lb/>
            the day was always afterwards called that of the ARia, <lb/>
            from the river of that name.</p>
          <p>It is a vexed question whether we ought to consider <lb/>
            some days unlucky, or whether Herakleitus was right in <lb/>
            rebuking Hesiod for calling some days good and some <lb/>
            bad, because he knew not that the nature of all days is the <lb/>
            same. However the mention of a few remarkable instances <lb/>
            is germane to the matter of which we are treating. It <lb/>
            happened that on the fifth day of the Boeotian month <lb/>
            Hippodromios, which the Athenians call Hekatombeion,* <lb/>
            two signal victories were won by the Bœotians, both of <lb/>
            which restored liberty to Greece; one, when they con­ <lb/>
            quered the Spartans at Leuktra, and the other, when, more <lb/>
            than two hundred years before this, they conquered the <lb/>
            Thessalians under Lattamyas at Keressus.</p>
          <p>Again, the Persians were beaten by the Greeks on the <lb/>
            sixth of Boedromion at Marathon, and on the third they <lb/>
            were beaten both at Platæa and at Mykale, and at Arbela <lb/>
            on the twenty-fifth of the same month. The Athenians <lb/>
            too won their naval victory under Chabrias at Naxos on <lb/>
            the full moon of Boedromion, and that of Salamis on the <lb/>
            twentieth of that month, as I have explained in my treatise <lb/>
            4 On Days.'</p>
          <p>The month of Thargelion evidently brings misfortune <lb/>
            to the barbarians, for Alexander defeated the Persian <lb/>
            king's generals on the Granicus in Thargelion, and the <note type="footnote"> 0 Plutarch himself was a Bœotian. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            Carthaginians were defeated by Timoleon in Sicily on the <lb/>
            twenty-seventh of Thargelion, at which same time Troy <lb/>
            is believed to have been taken, according to Ephorus, <lb/>
            Kallisthenes, Damastes and l'hylarchus.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the month Metageitnion, which the <lb/>
            Bœotians call Panemos, is unfavourable to the Greeks, for <lb/>
            on the seventh of that month they were defeated by <lb/>
            Antipater at Kranon and utterly ruined; and before that, <lb/>
            were defeated during that month by Philip at Chaeronea. <lb/>
            And on that same day and month and year Archidamus <lb/>
            and his troops, who had crossed over into Italy, were cut <lb/>
            to pieces by the natives. The twenty-first day of that <lb/>
            month is also observed by the Carthaginians as that which <lb/>
            has always brought the heaviest misfortunes upon them. <lb/>
            And I am well aware that at the time of the celebration <lb/>
            of the mysteries Thebes was destroyed for the second <lb/>
            time by Alexander, and that after this Athens was <lb/>
            garrisoned by Macedonian soldiers on the twentieth of <lb/>
            Boedromion, on which day they bring out the mystic <lb/>
            Iacchus in procession. And similarly the Romans, undei <lb/>
            the command of Cæpio, on that same day lost their camp <lb/>
            to the Gauls, and afterwards, under Lucullus, defeated <lb/>
            Tigranes and the Armenians. King Attalus and Pompeiu <lb/>
            the Great died on their own birthdays. And I could <lb/>
            mention many others, who have had both good and evil <lb/>
            fortune on the same anniversaries. But the Romans <lb/>
            regard that day as especially unlucky, and on account of <lb/>
            it, two other days in every month are thought so, as <lb/>
            superstitious feeling is increased by misfortune. This <lb/>
            subject I have treated at greater length in my treatise on <lb/>
            4 Roman Questions.'</p>
          <p>XX. If, after the battle, the Gauls had at once followed <lb/>
            up the fugitives, nothing could have prevented their taking <lb/>
            Rome and destroying every one who was left in it; such <lb/>
            terror did the beaten troops produce when they reached <lb/>
            home, and such panic fear seized upon every one. How­ <lb/>
            ever the barbarians scarcely believed in the completeness <lb/>
            of their victory, and betook themselves to making merry <lb/>
            over their success and to dividing the spoils taken in the <lb/>
            Roman camp, so that they afforded those who left the city <lb/>
            time to effect their escape, and those who remained in it <lb/>
            time to recover their courage and make preparations for <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            standing a siege. They abandoned all but the Capitol to <lb/>
            the enemy, and fortified it with additional ramparts and <lb/>
            stores of missiles. One of their first acts was to convey <lb/>
            most of their holy things into the Capitol, while the <lb/>
            Vestal virgins took the sacred fire and their other sacred <lb/>
            objects and fled with them from the city. Some indeed <lb/>
            say that nothing is entrusted to them except the eternal <lb/>
            fire, which King Numa appointed to be worshiped as the <lb/>
            origin of all things. For fire has the liveliest motion of <lb/>
            anything in nature; and everything is produced by motion <lb/>
            or with some kind of motion. All other parts of matter <lb/>
            when heat is absent lie useless and apparently dead, requir­ <lb/>
            ing the power of fire as the breath of life, to call them <lb/>
            into existence and make them capable of action.</p>
          <p>Numa therefore, being a learned man and commonly <lb/>
            supposed on account of his wisdom to hold communion with <lb/>
            the Muses, consecrated fire, and ordered it to be kept <lb/>
            unquenched for ever as an emblem of the eternal power <lb/>
            that orders all things. Others say that, as among the <lb/>
            Greeks, a purificatory fire burns before the temple, but <lb/>
            that within are other holy things which no man may see, <lb/>
            except only the virgins, who are named Vestals; and a very <lb/>
            wide-spread notion is, that the famous Trojan Palladium, <lb/>
            which was brought to Italy by AEneas, is kept there. <lb/>
            Others say that the Samothracian gods are there, whom <lb/>
            Dardanus brought to Troy after he had founded it, and <lb/>
            caused to be worshipped there, which, after the fall of <lb/>
            Troy, Æneas carried off and kept until he settled in <lb/>
            Italy. But those who pretend to know most about such <lb/>
            matters say that there are two jars of no great size in the <lb/>
            temple, one open and empty, and the other full and sealed, <lb/>
            and that these may be seen only by the holy virgins. <lb/>
            Others think that this is a mistake, arising from the fact <lb/>
            that, at the time of which we are treating, the Vestal <lb/>
            virgins placed most of their sacred things in two jars and <lb/>
            concealed them in the earth under the Temple of Quirinus, <lb/>
            which place even to the present day is called the Doliola, <lb/>
            or place of the jars.</p>
          <p>XXI. However this may be, the Vestals took the most <lb/>
            important of their holy things and betook themselves to <lb/>
            night along the Tiber. Here Lucius Albinus, a plebian, <lb/>
            was journeying among the fugitives, with his wife and <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            infant children and their few necessaries in a waggon. <lb/>
            When he saw the Vestal virgins, without any attendants, <lb/>
            journeying on foot and in distress, carrying in their <lb/>
            bosoms the sacred images of the gods, he at once re­ <lb/>
            moved his wife, children, and property from the waggon <lb/>
            and handed it over to them, to escape into one of the <lb/>
            Greek cities in Italy. The piety of Albums and his care <lb/>
            for the duties of religion at so terrible a crisis deserve <lb/>
            to be recorded.</p>
          <p>The rest of the priests and the old men who had been <lb/>
            consuls, and been honoured with triumphs, could not bear <lb/>
            to leave the city. At the instance of Fabius, the Pontifex <lb/>
            Maximus, they put on their sacred vestments and robes <lb/>
            of state, and after offering prayer to the gods, as if they <lb/>
            were consecrating themselves as victims to be offered on <lb/>
            behalf of their country, they sat down in their ivory <lb/>
            chairs in the Forum in full senatorial costume, and waited <lb/>
            what fortune might befal them.</p>
          <p>XXII. On the third day after the battle Brennus <lb/>
            appeared, leading his army to attack the city. At first, <lb/>
            seeing the gates open and no guards on the walls, he <lb/>
            feared some ambuscade, as he could not believe that the <lb/>
            Romans had so utterly despaired of themselves. When <lb/>
            he discovered the truth, he marched through the Colline <lb/>
            Gate, and captured Rome, a little more than three hundred <lb/>
            and sixty years after its foundation, if we can believe <lb/>
            that any accurate record has been kept of those periods <lb/>
            whose confusion has produced such difficulties in the <lb/>
            chronology of later times. However, an indistinct rumour <lb/>
            of the fall of Rome seems at once to have reached Greece : <lb/>
            for Herakleides of Pontus, who lived about that time, <lb/>
            speaks in his book ' On the Spirit,' of a rumour from the <lb/>
            west that an army had come from the Hyperboreans and <lb/>
            had sacked a Greek colony called Rome, which stood <lb/>
            somewhere in that direction, near the great ocean. Now, <lb/>
            as Herakleides was fond of strange legends, I should not <lb/>
            be surprised if he adorned the original true tale of the <lb/>
            capture of the city with these accessories of " the Hyper­ <lb/>
            boreans" and the great ocean." Aristotle, the philo­ <lb/>
            sopher, had evidently heard quite accurately that the <lb/>
            city was taken by the Gauls, but he says that it was <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            saved by one Lucius: now Camillus's name was Marcus, <lb/>
            not Lucius. All this, however, was pure conjecture.</p>
          <p>Brennus, after taking possession of Rome, posted a <lb/>
            force to watch the Capitol, and himself went down to <lb/>
            the Forum, and wondered at the men who sat there silent, <lb/>
            with all their ornaments, how they neither rose from <lb/>
            their seats at the approach of the enemy, nor changed <lb/>
            colour, but sat leaning on their staffs with fearless con­ <lb/>
            fidence, quietly looking at one another. The Gauls were <lb/>
            astonished at so strange a sight, and for a long time they <lb/>
            forbore to approach and touch them, as if they were <lb/>
            superior beings. But when one of them ventured to <lb/>
            draw near to Marcus Papirius and gently stroke his long <lb/>
            beard, Papirius struck him on the head with his staff, at <lb/>
            which the barbarian drew his sword and slew him. Upon <lb/>
            this they fell upon the rest and killed them, with any <lb/>
            other Romans whom they found, and spent many days <lb/>
            in plundering the houses, after which they burned them <lb/>
            and pulled them down in their rage at the men in the <lb/>
            Capitol, because they would not surrender, but drove <lb/>
            them back when they assaulted it. For this reason they <lb/>
            wreaked their vengeance on the city, and put to death <lb/>
            all their captives, men and women, old and young alike.</p>
          <p>XXIII. As the siege was a long one, the Gauls began <lb/>
            to want for provisions. They divided themselves into <lb/>
            two bodies, one of which remained with the king and <lb/>
            carried on the siege, while the others scoured the country, <lb/>
            plundering and destroying the villages, not going all <lb/>
            together in a body, but scattered in small detachments <lb/>
            in various directions, as their elation at their success <lb/>
            caused them to have no fear about separating their forces. <lb/>
            Their largest and best disciplined body marched towards <lb/>
            Ardea, where Camillus, since his banishment, had lived <lb/>
            as a private person. All his thoughts, however, were <lb/>
            bent not upon avoiding or fleeing from the Gauls, but <lb/>
            upon defeating them if possible. And so, seeing that the <lb/>
            people of Ardea were sufficient in numbers, but wanting <lb/>
            in confidence because of the want of experience and <lb/>
            remissness of their leaders, he first began to tell the <lb/>
            younger men that they ought not to ascribe the mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes of the Romans to the bravery of the Gauls, for <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            the misconduct of the former had given them a triumph <lb/>
            which they did not deserve. It would, he urged, be a <lb/>
            glorious thing, even at the risk of some danger, to drive <lb/>
            away a tribe of savage barbarians, who if they were <lb/>
            victorious always exterminated the vanquished: while, <lb/>
            if they only showed bravery and confidence, he could, <lb/>
            by watching his opportunity, lead them to certain victory. <lb/>
            As the younger men eagerly listened to these words, <lb/>
            Camillus proceeded to confer with the chief magistrates <lb/>
            of the Ardeates. After obtaining their consent also, he <lb/>
            armed all those who were capable of service, but kept <lb/>
            them within the walls, as he wished to conceal their <lb/>
            presence from the enemy who were now close at hand. <lb/>
            But when the Gauls after scouring the country returned <lb/>
            laden with plunder and carelessly encamped in the plain, <lb/>
            and when at night by the influence of wine and sleep all <lb/>
            was quiet in their camp, Camillus, who had learned the <lb/>
            state of the case from spies, led out the men of Ardea, and <lb/>
            marching over the intervening ground in silence, about <lb/>
            midnight attacked their entrenched camp with loud <lb/>
            shouts and blasts of his trumpet, which threw the Gauls, <lb/>
            half-drunk and heavy with sleep as they were, into <lb/>
            great confusion. Few recovered their senses so far as <lb/>
            to attempt to resist Camillus, and those few fell where <lb/>
            they stood; but most -or them were slain as they lay <lb/>
            helpless with wine and sleep. Such as escaped from the <lb/>
            camp and wandered about the fields were despatched by <lb/>
            cavalry the next day.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Jhe fame of this action, when noised among the <lb/>
            neighbouring cities, called many men to arms, especially <lb/>
            those Romans wno had escaped to Veil after the battle of <lb/>
            the Allia. These men lamented their fate, saying, " What <lb/>
            a general has Providence removed from Rome in Camillus, <lb/>
            whose successes now bring glory to Ardea, while the city <lb/>
            that produced and brought up so great a man has utterly <lb/>
            perished. And now we, for want of a general to lead us, <lb/>
            are sitting still inside the walls of a city not our own, and <lb/>
            giving up Italy to the enemy. Come, let us send to the <lb/>
            men of Ardea, and beg their general of them, or else our­ <lb/>
            selves take up our arms and march to him. He is no <lb/>
            longer an exile, nor are we any longer his countrymen, <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            for our country is ours DO more, but is in the hands of the <lb/>
            enemy."</p>
          <p>This was agreed, and they sent to beg Camillus to <lb/>
            become their general. But he refused, saying that be <lb/>
            would not do so without a decree from the citizens in the <lb/>
            Capitol; for they as long as they survived, represented the <lb/>
            city of Rome, and therefore although he would gladly obey <lb/>
            their commands, he would not be so officious as to inter­ <lb/>
            fere against their will. The soldiers admired the honour­ <lb/>
            able scruples of Camillus, but there was a great difficulty <lb/>
            in representing them to the garrison of the Capitol; indeed, <lb/>
            it seemed altogether impossible for a messenger to reach the <lb/>
            citadel while the city was in the possession of the enemy.</p>
          <p>XXV. One of the younger Romans, Pontius Cominius, <lb/>
            of the middle class of citizens, but with an honourable <lb/>
            ambition to distinguish himself, undertook the adventure. <lb/>
            He would not take any writing to the garrison, for fear <lb/>
            that if he were taken the enemy might discover Camillus's <lb/>
            plans. He dressed himself in poor clothes, with corks <lb/>
            concealed under them, and performed most of the journey <lb/>
            fearlessly by daylight, but when he came near the city he <lb/>
            went by night. As it was impossible to cross the river by <lb/>
            the bridge, which was held by the Gauls, he wrapped what <lb/>
            few clothes he had round his head, and trusted to his <lb/>
            corks to float him over to the city. After he had landed, <lb/>
            he walked round, observing by the lights and the noise <lb/>
            where the Gauls were most wakeful, until he reached the <lb/>
            Carmentan Gate, where all was quiet. At this place the <lb/>
            Capitolian Hill forms a steep and precipitous crag, up <lb/>
            which he climbed by a hollow in the cliff, and joined the <lb/>
            garrison. After greeting them and making known his <lb/>
            name, he proceeded to an interview with the leading men. <lb/>
            A meeting of the Senate was called, at which he recounted <lb/>
            Camillus's victory, which they had not heard of, and ex­ <lb/>
            plained the determination of the soldiers. He then begged <lb/>
            them to confirm Camillus s appointment as general, be­ <lb/>
            cause the citizens without the walls would obey no other.</p>
          <p>When the Senate heard this, they deliberated, and finally <lb/>
            appointed Camillus dictator, and sent back Pontius by the <lb/>
            same way that he came, which he was able to accomplish <lb/>
            as fortunately as before. He eluded the Gauls, and <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            brought the decree of the senate to the Romans outside <lb/>
            the walls.</p>
          <p>XXVI. They heard the news with enthusiasm, so that <lb/>
            Camillus when he came, found that they already numbered <lb/>
            twenty thousand, while he drew many additional troops <lb/>
            from the neighbouring friendly cities. Thus was Camillus <lb/>
            a second time appointed dictator, and, proceeding to Veii. <lb/>
            joined the soldiers there, to whom he added many others <lb/>
            from the allies, and prepared to attack the enemy. Bat <lb/>
            meanwhile at Rome, some of the Gauls happening to pass <lb/>
            by the place where Pontius climbed up the Capitol, noticed <lb/>
            in many places the marks of where he had clutched at the <lb/>
            rock with his hands and feet, torn off the plants which <lb/>
            grew upon it, and thrown down the mould. They brought <lb/>
            the news to the king, who came and viewed the place. <lb/>
            He said nothing at the time, but in the evening he called <lb/>
            together those Gauls who were lightest and most ac­ <lb/>
            customed to climb mountains, and thus addressed them : <lb/>
            " The road up the rock, which we by ourselves could not <lb/>
            discover, has been proved by our enemies not to be <lb/>
            impassable to men, and it would be disgraceful for us <lb/>
            after having begun so well to leave our enterprise in­ <lb/>
            complete, and to give up the place as impregnable after <lb/>
            the enemy themselves have shown us how it may be taken. <lb/>
            Where it is easy for one man to climb, it cannot be hard <lb/>
            for many to climb one by one, as their numbers will give <lb/>
            them confidence and mutual support. Suitable honours <lb/>
            and presents will be given to those who distinguish them­ <lb/>
            selves."</p>
          <p>XXVII. After this speech of their king, the Gauls <lb/>
            eagerly volunteered for the assault, and about midnight <lb/>
            many of them climbed silently up the rock, which although <lb/>
            rough and precipitous was easier of ascent than they had <lb/>
            imagined, so that the first of them reached the top, and <lb/>
            were on the point of preparing to attack the rampart and <lb/>
            its sleeping garrison, for neither men nor dogs noticed <lb/>
            them. But there were sacred geese kept in the temple of <lb/>
            Juno, which in other times were fed without stint, but <lb/>
            which then, as there was scarcely food enough for the men, <lb/>
            were somewhat neglected. These birds are naturally quick <lb/>
            of hearing and timid, and now being rendered wakeful <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            and wild by hunger, quickly perceived the Gauls climbing <lb/>
            up, and rushing noisily to the place woke the garri­ <lb/>
            son, while the Gauls feeling that they were discovered <lb/>
            no longer preserved silence, but violently assaulted the <lb/>
            place. The Romans, snatching up whatever arms came <lb/>
            first to hand, ran to repulse them: and first of all Manlius, <lb/>
            a man of consular rank, strong of body and full of courage, <lb/>
            fell in with two of the enemy. As one of them lifted up his <lb/>
            battleaxe, Manlius cut off his right hand with his sword, <lb/>
            while he dashed his shield into the other's face, and threw <lb/>
            him backwards down the cliff. After this he stood upon <lb/>
            the wall, and with the help of those who assembled round <lb/>
            him, beat off the rest, for not many had reached the top, or <lb/>
            effected anything commensurate with the boldness of the <lb/>
            attempt. Having thus escaped the danger, the Romans <lb/>
            threw their sentinel down the rock ; while on Manlius <lb/>
            they conferred by vote a reward for his bravery, intended <lb/>
            more for honour than advantage; for each man gave him a <lb/>
            day's rations, which consisted of half a Roman pound of <lb/>
            meal, and the fourth part of a Greek cotyle of wine.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. This affair disheartened the Gauls, who were <lb/>
            also in want of provisions, for they could not forage as <lb/>
            before for fear of Camillus, while disease also crept in <lb/>
            among them, encamped as they were in the ruins of Rome <lb/>
            among heaps of dead bodies, while the deep layer of ashes <lb/>
            became blown by the wind into the air, making it dry and <lb/>
            harsh, and the vapours of the conflagrations were injurious <lb/>
            to breathe. They were especially distressed by the change <lb/>
            from a cloudy country where there are plenty of shady <lb/>
            retreats, to the flat burning plains of Rome in autumn, <lb/>
            and their siege of the Capitol became wearisome, for they <lb/>
            had now beleaguered it for seven months; so that there <lb/>
            was much sickness in their camp, and so many died that <lb/>
            they no longer buried the dead. Yet for all this the <lb/>
            besieged fared no better. Hunger pressed them, and their <lb/>
            ignorance of what Camillus was doing disheartened them; <lb/>
            for no one could reach them with news, because the city <lb/>
            was strictly watched by Gauls. As both parties were <lb/>
            in these straits, proposals for a capitulation took place; <lb/>
            at first among the outposts on both sides; afterwards <lb/>
            the chief men on each side. Brennus, the Gaulish <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            king, and Sulpicius the Roman tribune, met, and it <lb/>
            was agreed that the Romans should pay a thousand <lb/>
            pounds of gold, and that the Gauls should, on receiving <lb/>
            it, at once leave the country. Both parties swore to observe <lb/>
            these conditions, but when the gold was being weighed, <lb/>
            the Gauls at first tampered with the scales unperceived, <lb/>
            and then openly pulled the beam, so that the Romans <lb/>
            became angry. But at this Brennus insolently took off <lb/>
            his sword and belt, and flung them into the scale; and <lb/>
            when Sulpicius asked, " What is this ? " " What should <lb/>
            it be," replied the Gaul; " but woe to the vanquished ! " <lb/>
            At this some of the Romans were angry and thought that <lb/>
            they ought to take back their gold into the Capitol, and <lb/>
            again endure the siege; while others said that they must <lb/>
            put up with insults, provided they were not too out­ <lb/>
            rageous, and not think that there was any additional <lb/>
            disgrace in paying more than they had agreed, because <lb/>
            in paying any ransom at all, they were acting from sheer <lb/>
            necessity rather than feelings of honour.</p>
          <p>XXIX. While the Romans were thus disputing with <lb/>
            the Gauls, and with one another, Camillus with his army <lb/>
            was at the gates. Learning what was being done, he <lb/>
            ordered the mass of his soldiers to follow him quietly and <lb/>
            in good order, and himself pushed on with the picked <lb/>
            troops to join the Romans, who all made way for him, <lb/>
            and received him as dictator with silence and respect. <lb/>
            He then took the gold from the scales and gave it to his <lb/>
            victors, and ordered the Gauls to take the scales and the <lb/>
            beam, and depart, " for," said he, " it is the custom of the <lb/>
            Romans to defend their country not with gold but with <lb/>
            iron." At this Brennus became angry, and said that he <lb/>
            was being wronged by the treaty being broken; and <lb/>
            Camillus answered that the negotiations were illegal, <lb/>
            because when they began he was already dictator, and <lb/>
            therefore, as no one else had any authority, the treaty <lb/>
            had been made by the Gauls with persons who were not <lb/>
            authorized to treat. But now, if they wished, they might <lb/>
            make fresh proposals, for he was come with full legal <lb/>
            powers to pardon such as made their submission, and to <lb/>
            punish unrepentant evil-doers. Enraged at this, Brennus <lb/>
            began to skirmish, and the two parties, mixed up as they <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            were, in houses and lands where no military formation <lb/>
            was possible, did go so far as to draw their swords and <lb/>
            push one another about; but Brennus soon recovered his <lb/>
            temper, and drew off the Gauls, with but little loss, in <lb/>
            their camp.</p>
          <p>During the night he got them all under arms, left the <lb/>
            city, and, after a march of about eight miles, encamped <lb/>
            by the side of the Gabinian Road. But at daybreak, <lb/>
            Camillus was upon him, in glittering armour, leading on <lb/>
            the Romans who had now recovered their courage. After <lb/>
            a long and fiercely contested battle they routed the Gauls <lb/>
            and took their camp. Some of the fugitives were at once <lb/>
            pursued and slain, but most of them straggled about the <lb/>
            country, and were put to death by the people of the <lb/>
            neighbouring towns and villages who sallied out upon <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>XXX. Thus was Rome strangely taken, and yet more <lb/>
            strangely preserved, after having been for seven months <lb/>
            in the possession of the Gauls, for they entered it a few <lb/>
            days after the Ides of Quintilis, and left it about the <lb/>
            Ides of February. Camillus, as we may easily imagine, <lb/>
            entered the city in a triumph, as the- saviour of his lost <lb/>
            country, and the restorer of Rome to itself; for as he <lb/>
            drove into the city he was accompanied by those who had <lb/>
            before left it, with their wives and children, while those <lb/>
            who had been besieged in the Capitol, and all but starved <lb/>
            there, came out to meet him embracing one another, <lb/>
            weeping, and scarcely believing in their present happiness. <lb/>
            The priests and servants of the gods also appeared with <lb/>
            such of the sacred things as they had saved, either by <lb/>
            burying them on the spot, or by carrying them away, <lb/>
            and now displayed these images, which had not been seen <lb/>
            for so long a time, to the citizens, who greeted them with <lb/>
            joy, as if the gods themselves were again returning to Rome. <lb/>
            Camillus performed a sacrifice to the gods, and purified <lb/>
            the city in the manner recommended by experts, and then <lb/>
            proceeded to restore all the previously existing temples, <lb/>
            while he himself added another to Aim Loquutius, or <lb/>
            Rumour, having carefully sought out the place at which <lb/>
            the voice in the night miraculously foretold the coming <lb/>
            of the Gaulish host to Marcus Cædicius.</p><pb n="239"/>
            
          <p>XXXI. With great difficulty the sites of the temples were <lb/>
            cleared of rubbish by the zeal of Camillus and the labour of <lb/>
            the priests; but as the city was utterly destroyed, and re­ <lb/>
            quired to be entirely rebuilt, the people became disheartened <lb/>
            at so great an undertaking. Men who had lost their all <lb/>
            were inclined to wait, and indeed required rest after their <lb/>
            misfortunes, rather than labours and toils, which neither <lb/>
            their bodies nor their purses were able to endure. And <lb/>
            thus it came to pass that they turned their thoughts a <lb/>
            second time towards Veil, a city which stood quite ready <lb/>
            to be inhabited. This gave opportunities to their mob <lb/>
            orators to make speeches, as usual, which they knew <lb/>
            would be pleasing to the people, in which Camillus was <lb/>
            disrespectfully spoken of as depriving them of a city <lb/>
            which stood ready to receive them, for his own prviate <lb/>
            ambition, and was said to be compelling them to live <lb/>
            encamped in the midst of ruins, and re-erect their houses <lb/>
            in that vast heap of ashes, all in order that he might be <lb/>
            called, not merely the leader and general of Rome, but <lb/>
            might usurp the place of Romulus and be called her <lb/>
            founder. Fearing disturbances, the Senate would not <lb/>
            permit Camillus to lay down his dictatorship for a year, <lb/>
            although he wished to do so, and although no dictator <lb/>
            before this had ever remained in office for more than six <lb/>
            months. In the meantime the senators themselves en­ <lb/>
            couraged and consoled the people by personal appeals, <lb/>
            pointing to the tombs and monuments of their ancestors, <lb/>
            and recalling to their minds the temples and holy places <lb/>
            which Romulus and Numa and the other kings had <lb/>
            consecrated and left in charge to them. More especially <lb/>
            they dwelt upon the omen of the newly severed head <lb/>
            which had been found when the foundations of the Capitol <lb/>
            were dug, by which it was proved that that spot was fated <lb/>
            to become the head of Italy, and the fire of Vesta which <lb/>
            the virgins had relighted after the war, and which it <lb/>
            would be a disgrace for them to extinguish, and to abandon <lb/>
            the city, whether they were to see it inhabited by foreigners <lb/>
            or turned into fields for cattle to feed in. While per­ <lb/>
            sistently urging these considerations both in public <lb/>
            speeches and in private interviews with the people, they <lb/>
            were much affected by the lamentations of the poor over <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            their helpless condition. The people begged that, as they <lb/>
            had, like people after a shipwreck, saved their lives and <lb/>
            nothing else, they might not, in addition to this misfortune, <lb/>
            be compelled to put together the ruins of a city which had <lb/>
            been utterly destroyed, while another was standing ready <lb/>
            to receive them.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Under these circumstances, Camillus deter­ <lb/>
            mined to debate the question publicly. He himself made <lb/>
            a long appeal on behalf of his native place, and many <lb/>
            other speeches were delivered. Finally he rose, and bade <lb/>
            Lucius Lucretius, whose privilege it was, to vote first, and <lb/>
            then after him the rest in order. Silence was enforced, <lb/>
            and Lucretius was just on the point of voting when a <lb/>
            centurion in command of a detachment of the guard of the <lb/>
            day marched by, and in a loud voice called to the standard- <lb/>
            bearer : " Pitch the standard here: here it is best for us <lb/>
            to stay." When these words were heard so opportunely <lb/>
            in the midst of their deliberations about the future, <lb/>
            Lucretius reverently said that he accepted the omen, and <lb/>
            gave his vote in accordance with it, and his example was <lb/>
            followed by all the rest. The people now showed a <lb/>
            strange revulsion of feeling, for they encouraged one <lb/>
            another to begin the work of rebuilding, not on any <lb/>
            regular plan, but just as each man happened to find a <lb/>
            convenient place for his work. Consequently they quickly <lb/>
            rebuilt the city, for within a year it is said thatboth the <lb/>
            city walls and the private houses were completed; but <lb/>
            it was full of intricate, narrow lanes and inconveniently <lb/>
            placed houses.</p>
          <p>The priests, who had been ordered by Camillus to mark <lb/>
            out the boundaries where the temples had stood among <lb/>
            the general wreck, when in their circuit of the Palatine <lb/>
            Hill they came upon the chapel of Mars, found it, like <lb/>
            every other building, destroyed and levelled to the ground <lb/>
            by the Gauls, but while thoroughly examining the place <lb/>
            they found the augur's staff of Romulus hidden under a <lb/>
            deep heap of ashes. This staff is curved at one end, and <lb/>
            is called lituu8. They use it to divide the heavens into <lb/>
            squares when taking the auspices, just as Romulus himself <lb/>
            did, as he was deeply skilled in divination. When he <lb/>
            vanished from among mankind, the priests kept his staff <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            just like any other sacred object. That at such a time, <lb/>
            when all the other holy things perished, this should have <lb/>
            been preserved, gave them good hopes of Rome, which <lb/>
            that omen seemed to presage would be eternal.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Before they had finished rebuilding the city <lb/>
            they became involved in a war, for the Æquians, Volscians, <lb/>
            and Latins combined their forces and invaded the country, <lb/>
            While the Etillscans besieged Sutrium acity in alliance <lb/>
            with Rome. The tribunes in command of the Roman <lb/>
            forces encamped near the Marcian heights, and were <lb/>
            there besieged by the Latins and in danger of having <lb/>
            their camp taken. They sent to Rome for assistance, <lb/>
            and the Romans appointed Camillus dictator for the third <lb/>
            time. About this war there are two different accounts, <lb/>
            of which I will mention the legendary one first :-It is <lb/>
            said that the Latins, either merely as a pretext, or really <lb/>
            wishing to amalgamate the two races as before, sent a <lb/>
            demand to Rome for free unmarried women to be delivered <lb/>
            up for them to marry. As the Romans were at their wits' <lb/>
            ends what to do, because they feared to go to war, being <lb/>
            scarcely recovered from their late mishap, while they <lb/>
            suspected that the women would be used as hostages if <lb/>
            they gave them up, and that the proposal of intermarriage <lb/>
            was merely a feint, a slave girl named Tutula, or, as some <lb/>
            say, Philotis, advised the magistrates to send her and the <lb/>
            best-looking of the female slaves, dressed like brides of <lb/>
            noble birth, and that she would manage the rest. The <lb/>
            magistrates approved of her proposal, chose such girls as <lb/>
            she thought suitable, and having dressed them in fine <lb/>
            clothes and jewellery, handed them over to the Latins, <lb/>
            who were encamped at no great distance from the city. <lb/>
            At night the girls stole the daggers of the enemies, and <lb/>
            Tutula or l'hilotis climbed up a wild fig-tree, stretched <lb/>
            out her cloak behind her, and raised a torch as a signal, <lb/>
            which had been agreed upon between her and the magis­ <lb/>
            trates, though no other citizen knew of it. Wherefore, <lb/>
            the soldier. rushed out of the gates with a great clamour <lb/>
            and disturbance, calling to one another and scarcely able <lb/>
            to keep their ranks as their chiefs hurried them along. <lb/>
            When they reached the enemy's camp, they found them <lb/>
            asleep and not expecting an attack, so that they took <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            their camp and slew most of them. This took place on <lb/>
            the nones of the month Quintilis, now called July, and <lb/>
            the festival which then takes place is in memory of the <lb/>
            events of that day. First they march out of the gates in <lb/>
            a mass, calling out the common names of the country, <lb/>
            such as Caius, Marcus, or Lucius, in imitation of their <lb/>
            hurried calling for each other on that occasion. Next, <lb/>
            female slaves splendidly dressed walk round laughing <lb/>
            and romping with all whom they meet. These girls also <lb/>
            perform a sort of fight among themselves, like those who <lb/>
            on that day took their share in the fight with the Latins : <lb/>
            and afterwards they sit down to a feast, under the shade <lb/>
            of fig-tree boughs. They call this day the nonce caprotinœ, <lb/>
            probably from the wild fig-tree from which the slave <lb/>
            girl waved the torch; for in Latin a wild fig-tree is <lb/>
            called caprificus. Others say that most of these things <lb/>
            were said and done when Romulus disappeared, for on <lb/>
            this very day he was snatched away, outside the city <lb/>
            gates, in a sudden storm and darkness, or as some think <lb/>
            during an eclipse of the sun: and they say that the day <lb/>
            is called nonce caprotince from the place, because Romulus <lb/>
            was carried off while holding a meeting of the entire <lb/>
            people at the place called the Goat'is Marsh, as is written <lb/>
            in his life.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. The other story is approved by most writers, <lb/>
            who relate it as follows:—Camillus, after being appointed <lb/>
            dictator for the third time, and learning that the army <lb/>
            under the command of the military tribunes was being <lb/>
            besieged by the Latins and Volscians, was compelled to <lb/>
            arm even those citizens who were past the age for service <lb/>
            in the field. He marched by a long circuit to the <lb/>
            Marcian heights unnoticed by the enemy, and established <lb/>
            his army behind them. By lighting fires he announced <lb/>
            his arrival to the Romans in the camp, who took courage, <lb/>
            and began to meditate sallying out of their camp and <lb/>
            attacking the enemy. But the Latins and Volscianb <lb/>
            kept close within the rampart of their camp, which they <lb/>
            fortified with many additional palisades, on all sides, for <lb/>
            they now were between two hostile armies, and intended to <lb/>
            await succour from home, while they also expected a force <lb/>
            from Ftruria to come to their aid. Camillus, perceiving <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            this, and fearing that he might be surrounded in his turn, <lb/>
            vigorously used his opportunity. The rampart of the <lb/>
            allies was formed of wood, and as a strong wind blew down <lb/>
            from the mountains at daybreak, he prepared com­ <lb/>
            bustibles, and early in the morning got his forces under <lb/>
            arms. One division he sent to attack the enemy's camp <lb/>
            with darts, and missile weapons, and loud shouts, while he <lb/>
            himself, with those who were in charge of the fire, waited <lb/>
            for his opportunity on that side towards which the wind <lb/>
            usually blew. When the other troops were engaged with <lb/>
            the enemy, the sun rose, and a strong wind got up. At <lb/>
            this Camillus gave the signal for attack, and at once <lb/>
            enveloped the palisades with lighted missiles. As the <lb/>
            flames quickly spread in the thick wooden palisades, the <lb/>
            Latins, finding their camp girt with flames, were driven <lb/>
            into a small compass, and finally obliged to sally out of <lb/>
            their entrenchments, outside of which the Romans stood <lb/>
            ready to receive them. Few of those who broke out <lb/>
            escaped, while all who remained in the camp perished in the <lb/>
            flames, until the Romans extinguished them and began to <lb/>
            plunder.</p>
          <p>XXXV. After this exploit, Camillus left his son Lucius <lb/>
            in charge of the camp, to guard the prisoners and the booty, <lb/>
            and himself invaded the enemy's country. He took the <lb/>
            capital of the Æqui, reduced the Volsci to subjection, and <lb/>
            marched at once upon Sutrium to relieve that city, whose <lb/>
            inhabitants had not heard of his successes, but were still <lb/>
            besieged by the Etruscans. The Sutrians had just sur­ <lb/>
            rendered, and had been turned out of their city by the <lb/>
            enemy with nothing but the clothes they had on. Camillus <lb/>
            met them on the road with their wives and children, <lb/>
            weeping over their misfortune. He was greatly moved at <lb/>
            so piteous a sight, and, perceiving that the Romans were <lb/>
            touched by the despairing entreaties of the people of <lb/>
            Sutrium, who clung to them with tears in their eyes, <lb/>
            determined that he would at once avenge their wrongs, <lb/>
            and march upon Sutrium that very day, arguing that men <lb/>
            who were merry with success, having just captured a <lb/>
            wealthy city, with no enemy either left within its walls <lb/>
            or expected from without, would be found in careless dis­ <lb/>
            order. In this conjecture he was right; for he not only <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="244"/>
            marched through the country, but even obtained possession <lb/>
            of the walls and gates unperceived by the enemy, who had <lb/>
            posted no guards, but were carousing in the various <lb/>
            private houses. Indeed when they learned that the <lb/>
            Romans were in possession of the town, they were in such <lb/>
            a condition of intoxication that most of them could not <lb/>
            even attempt to escape, but shamefully waited in the <lb/>
            houses where they were until they were either killed or <lb/>
            taken prisoners. Thus was the city of Sutrium twice <lb/>
            taken in one day, and thus did the victors lose their prize, <lb/>
            and the dispossessed inhabitants regain their homes by <lb/>
            Camillus's means.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. The triumph which he enjoyed after these <lb/>
            campaigns added to his popularitynd glory as much as <lb/>
            either of the former; for even those who disliked him <lb/>
            most, and who had insisted that all his successes were due <lb/>
            to good fortune more than to skill, were now forced to <lb/>
            admit the brilliancy of his generalship, and to give his <lb/>
            genius its due. The chief of his enemies and detractors <lb/>
            was Marcus Manlius, he who had been the first man to <lb/>
            fling the Gauls down the cliff in the night attack on the <lb/>
            Capitol, and who in remembrance of this was surnamed <lb/>
            Capitolinus. This man, endeavouring to make himself <lb/>
            the first man in Rome, and not being able to surpass the <lb/>
            fame of Camillus by fair means, made the accusation <lb/>
            against him usual in such cases, that he was intending to <lb/>
            make himself king. This falsehood he repeated in his <lb/>
            addresses to the people, with whom he was making him­ <lb/>
            self popular, especially with those who were in debt ; <lb/>
            some of whom he defended, and assisted in coming to terms <lb/>
            with their creditors, while others he forcibly rescued from <lb/>
            the officers of the law, so that many needy persons were <lb/>
            attracted to him, and became the terror of all respectable <lb/>
            citizens by their riotous disturbances in the Forum. To put <lb/>
            an end to these disorders, Quintus Capitolinus was created <lb/>
            dictator, and he put Manlius in prison; but the people <lb/>
            upon this went into mourning, a thing only done on the <lb/>
            occasion of some great public disaster, and the Senate, <lb/>
            terrified at this, ordered Manlius to be acquitted. Manlius <lb/>
            was not improved by his captivity, but was more tur­ <lb/>
            bulent and disorderly in his conduct than he had been <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            before. Camillus was now again electedmilitary tribune, <lb/>
            and Manlius was impeached: but the place in which he <lb/>
            was tried told greatly against his accusers. For the very <lb/>
            spot on the Capitol on which Manlius fought with the Gauls <lb/>
            on that night was visible from the Forum, and the sight <lb/>
            of it raised a strong feeling in his favour; while he him­ <lb/>
            self pointed to it, and, with tears in his eyes, reminded <lb/>
            them of how he had fought for them, so that his judges <lb/>
            were at their wits' end, and often adjourned the trial, for <lb/>
            they could not acquit him of a crime which was clearly <lb/>
            proved against him, and yet they could not bring them­ <lb/>
            selves to let the law take its course, when the scene before <lb/>
            them reminded them constantly of his great exploit. <lb/>
            Camillus, perceiving this, removed the court to the Petelian <lb/>
            Grove outside the city gates, where, as the Capitol was not <lb/>
            visible, the prosecutor was able to press home his charges <lb/>
            against Manlius, while the judges were not prevented from <lb/>
            punishing him for his recent crimes by their remembrance <lb/>
            of what he had done in former times. He was convicted, <lb/>
            led to the Capitol, and thrown down the cliff, which thus <lb/>
            witnessed both the most glorious deed of his life, and his <lb/>
            miserable end. The Romans destroyed his house, on the <lb/>
            site of which they built the Temple of Juno Moneta, and <lb/>
            decreed that for the future no patrician might dwell upon <lb/>
            the Capitol.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Camillus, when appointed military tribune <lb/>
            for the sixth time. begged to be excused, as he was growing <lb/>
            old, and perhaps feared that such unbroken success and <lb/>
            glory would call down upon him the wrath of the gods.- <note type="footnote"> 0 The punishment of excessive and unbroken prosperity was assigned <lb/>
            by the Greeks to the goddess Nemesis. The idea of too great a career <lb/>
            of success exciting the anger of the gods is common throughout <lb/>
            the whole of ancient literature. A well-known instance is the story <lb/>
            of Polykrates of Samos, as told by Herodotus. Amasis the king of <lb/>
            Egypt, observing the unbroken good fortune of Polykrates, advised him <lb/>
            voluntarily to sacrifice some of his treasures. Polykrates, following <lb/>
            his friend's advice, cast his signer-ring into the sea. But the ring was <lb/>
            swallowed by a fish, and the fish was caught and presented to the king, <lb/>
            who thus recovered his ring. When Amasis heard of this, he refused <lb/>
            to ally himself with Polykrates, thinking that such good fortune pre­ <lb/>
            saged a terrible disaster. Polykrates was put to death shortly after. <lb/>
            wards by the Persians, who conquered his kingdom. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            His most obvious reason for declining the appointment <lb/>
            was the state of his health, for at this time he was sick. <lb/>
            However, the people would not permit him to retire, but <lb/>
            loudly urged that they did not want him to ride on horse­ <lb/>
            back or fight in the ranks, but merely to advise and <lb/>
            superintend. Thus they compelled him to accept the office, <lb/>
            and with one of his colleagues, Lucius Furius, at once to <lb/>
            lead an army against the enemy. He left the city and <lb/>
            encamped near the enemy, where he wished to remain <lb/>
            inactive, in order that, if a battle should be necessary, he <lb/>
            might recover his health sufficiently to take part in it. <lb/>
            But as his colleague Lucius, who longed to distinguish <lb/>
            himself, was so eager for action that he could not be <lb/>
            restrained, and excited the subordinate officers, Camillus, <lb/>
            fearing that it might be supposed that he grudged younger <lb/>
            men an opportunity of gaining laurels, agreed, sorely <lb/>
            against his will, to allow his colleague to lead out the army <lb/>
            and offer battle, while he with a few troops remained <lb/>
            behind in the camp. But when he heard that Lucius had <lb/>
            rashly engaged and that the Romans were defeated, he <lb/>
            could not restrain himself, but leaping from his couch met <lb/>
            them with his followers at the gate of the camp. Here <lb/>
            . he forced his way through the fugitives and attacked the <lb/>
            pursuing force, so that those Romans whom he had passed <lb/>
            at once turned and followed him, while those who were <lb/>
            still outside the camp rallied round him, calling upon one <lb/>
            another not to desert their general. The enemy's pursuit <lb/>
            was thus checked, and on the following day Camillus <lb/>
            marched out with his entire force, entirely defeated them, <lb/>
            and entering their camp together with the fugitives, put <lb/>
            most of them to the sword. After this, hearing that <lb/>
            Satria had been captured by the Etruscans, and all the <lb/>
            Roman colonists there put to death, he sent the greater <lb/>
            part of his force back to Rome, reserving only the young­ <lb/>
            est and most vigorous of the soldiers, with whom he <lb/>
            assaulted the Etruscans who held the city, and conquered <lb/>
            them, killing many, and putting the rest to flight.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. By his return to Rome with great spoils, he <lb/>
            proved that those men were right who had not feared that <lb/>
            weakness or old age would impair the faculties of a general <lb/>
            of daring and experience, but who had chosen him, ill and <lb/>
             <pb n="247"/>
            unwilling to act as he was, rather than men in the prime <lb/>
            of life, who were eager to hold military commands. For <lb/>
            this reason, when the people of Tusculum were reported to <lb/>
            be in insurrection, they bade Camillus take one of the <lb/>
            other five tribunes as his colleague, and march against <lb/>
            them. Camillus, in spite of all that the rest of the tribunes <lb/>
            could urge, for they all wished to be taken, chose Lucius <lb/>
            Furius, whom no one could have supposed he would have <lb/>
            chosen ; for he it was who had been so eager to fight, against <lb/>
            the better judgment of Camillus, and so had brought about <lb/>
            the defeat in the late war; however, Camillus chose him <lb/>
            rather than any other, wishing, it would appear, to conceal <lb/>
            his misfortune and wipe out his disgrace.</p>
          <p>The people of Tusculum cleverly repaired their fault. <lb/>
            When Camillus marched to attack them they filled the <lb/>
            country with men working in the fields and tending cattle <lb/>
            just as in time of peace; the city gates were open, the boys <lb/>
            at school, the lower classes plying various trades, and the <lb/>
            richer citizens walking in the market-place in peaceful <lb/>
            dress. The magistrates bustled about the city, pointing <lb/>
            out where the Romans were to be quartered, as if the <lb/>
            thought of treachery had never entered their minds. <lb/>
            Camillus, though this conduct did not shake his belief in <lb/>
            their guilt, was moved to pity by their repentance. He <lb/>
            ordered them to go to Rome and beg the Senate to pardon <lb/>
            them; and when they appeared, he himself used his <lb/>
            influence to procure their forgiveness, and the admission <lb/>
            of Tusculum to the Roman franchise. These were the <lb/>
            most remarkable events of his sixth tribuneship.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. After this, Licinius Stole put himself at the <lb/>
            head of the plebeians in their great quarrel with the <lb/>
            Senate. They demanded that consuls should be re-estab­ <lb/>
            lished one of whom should always be a plebeian, and that <lb/>
            they should never "both be patricians. Tribunes of the <lb/>
            people were appointed, but the people would not suffer <lb/>
            any election of consuls to be held. As this want of chief <lb/>
            magistrates seemed likely to lead to still greater disorders, <lb/>
            the Senate, much against the will of the people, appointed <lb/>
            Camillus dictator for the fourth time. He himself did not <lb/>
            wish for the post, for he was loth to oppose men who had <lb/>
            been his comrades in many hard-fought campaigns, as <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            indeed he had spent much more of his life in the camp <lb/>
            with his soldiers than with the patrician party in political <lb/>
            intrigues, by one of which he was now appointed, as that <lb/>
            party hoped that if successful he would crush the power of <lb/>
            the plebeians, while in case of failure he would be ruined. <lb/>
            However, he made an effort to deal with the present diffi. <lb/>
            culty. Knowing the day on which the tribunes intended to <lb/>
            bring forward their law, he published a muster-roll of men <lb/>
            for military service, and charged the people to leave the <lb/>
            Forum and meet him on the Field of Mars, threatening <lb/>
            those who disobeyed with a heavy fine. But when <lb/>
            the tribunes answered his threats by vowing that they <lb/>
            would fine him fifty thousand drachmas unless he ceased <lb/>
            his interference with the people's right of voting, he <lb/>
            retired to his own house, and after a few days laid down <lb/>
            his office on pretence of sickness. This he did, either <lb/>
            because he feared a second condemnation and banishment, <lb/>
            which would be a disgrace to an old man and one who had <lb/>
            done such great deeds, or else because he saw that the <lb/>
            people were too strong to be overpowered, and he did not <lb/>
            wish to make the attempt.</p>
          <p>The Senate appointed another dictator, but he made that <lb/>
            very Licinius Stole, the leader of the popular party, his <lb/>
            master of the horse, and thus enabled him to pass a law <lb/>
            which was especially distasteful to the patricians, for it <lb/>
            forbade any one to possess more than five hundred jugera <lb/>
            of land. Stole, after this success, became an important <lb/>
            personage; but, a short time afterwards, he was convicted <lb/>
            of possessing more land than his own law permitted, and <lb/>
            was punished according to its provisions.</p>
          <p>XL. There still remained the difficulty about the con­ <lb/>
            sular elections, the most important point at issue between <lb/>
            the two parties, and the Senate was greatly disturbed at <lb/>
            it, when news arrived that the Gauls, starting from the <lb/>
            Adriatic Sea, were a second time marching in great force <lb/>
            upon Home. At the same time evident traces of their <lb/>
            approach could be seen, as the country was being plundered, <lb/>
            and such of the inhabitants as could not easily reach Rome <lb/>
            were taking refuge in the mountains.</p>
          <p>This terrible tidings put an end to all internal disputes. <lb/>
            The Senate and people formed themselves into one assembly, <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            and with one voice appointed Camillus dictator for the <lb/>
            fifth time. He was now a very old man, being near his <lb/>
            eightieth year; but at this pressing crisis he made none <lb/>
            of his former excuses, but at once took the chief command <lb/>
            and levied an army for the war. As he knew that the <lb/>
            chief power of the Gauls lay in their swords, with which <lb/>
            they dealt heavy blows on the heads and shoulders of their <lb/>
            enemy, without any skill in fence, he prepared for most <lb/>
            of his soldiers helmets made entirely of smooth iron, so <lb/>
            that the swords would either break or glance off them, <lb/>
            while he also had brass rims fitted to their shields, because <lb/>
            the wood by itself could not endure a blow. He also <lb/>
            instructed the soldiers to use long pikes, and to thrust <lb/>
            them forward to receive the sword-cuts of the enemy.</p>
          <p>XLI. When the Gauls were encamped on the banks of <lb/>
            the Anio, near the city, loaded with masses of plunder, <lb/>
            Camillus led out his troops and posted them in a glen from <lb/>
            which many valleys branched out, so that the greater <lb/>
            part of the force was concealed, and that which was seen <lb/>
            appeared to be clinging in terror to the hilly ground. <lb/>
            Camillus, wishing to confirm the enemy in this idea, would <lb/>
            not move to prevent the country being plundered before <lb/>
            his eyes, but palisaded his camp and remained quiet <lb/>
            within it, until he saw that the foraging parties of the <lb/>
            Gauls straggled in careless disorder, while those in the <lb/>
            camp did nothing but eat and drink. Then, sending <lb/>
            forward his light troops before daybreak to be ready to <lb/>
            harass the Gauls and prevent their forming their ranks <lb/>
            properly as they came out of their camp, he marched the <lb/>
            heavy-armed men down into the plain at sunrise, a <lb/>
            numerous and confident body, and not, as the Gauls <lb/>
            fancied, a few disheartened men.</p>
          <p>The very fact of his commencing the attack dashed the <lb/>
            courage of the Gauls ; next, the attacks of the light troops, <lb/>
            before they had got into their wonted array and divided <lb/>
            themselves into regiments, produced disorder. When at <lb/>
            last Camillus led on the heavy-armed troops, the Gauls <lb/>
            ran to meet them brandishing their swords, but the Romans <lb/>
            with their pikes advanced and met them, receiving their <lb/>
            sword-cuts on their armour, which soon made the Gaulish <lb/>
            swords bend double, as they were made of soft iron ham­ <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            mered out thin, while the shields of the Gauls were pierced <lb/>
            and weighed down by the pikes that stuck in them. They <lb/>
            therefore dropped their own arms, and endeavoured to seize <lb/>
            the pikes and turn them against their enemies. But the <lb/>
            Romans, seeing them now defenceless, began to use their <lb/>
            swords, and slew many of the first ranks, while the rest <lb/>
            took to flight all over the flat country; for Camillus had <lb/>
            taken care to guard the hills and rough ground, while the <lb/>
            Gauls knew that they, in their over-confidence, had been <lb/>
            at no pains to fortify their camp, and that the Romans <lb/>
            could easily take it.</p>
          <p>This battle is said to have been fought .thirteen years <lb/>
            after the capture of Rome, and in consequence of it the <lb/>
            Romans conceived a contempt for these barbarians, whom <lb/>
            they had before greatly dreaded, and even believed that <lb/>
            their former victories over the Gauls were due to their being <lb/>
            weakened by pestilence, and to fortunate circumstances, <lb/>
            rather than to their own valour. This raised so great a <lb/>
            terror of them, that a law was passed which relieved the <lb/>
            priests from military service except in case of a Gaulish <lb/>
            invasion.</p>
          <p>XLII. This was the last of Camillus's military exploits, <lb/>
            though during this campaign he took the city of Velitræ, <lb/>
            which yielded to him without a battle. But his greatest <lb/>
            political struggle was yet to come, for it was harder to <lb/>
            deal with the people now that they were elated with <lb/>
            victory. They insisted that the existing constitution should <lb/>
            be annulled, and that one of the-two <lb/>
            chosen from among them. They were opposed by the <lb/>
            Senate, which would not permit Camillus to lay down his <lb/>
            office, as the patricians imagined that with the help of his - <lb/>
            great power they could more easily defend their privileges. <lb/>
            One day, however, as Camillus was sitting publicly doing <lb/>
            business in the Forum, a viator or servant sent by the <lb/>
            tribunes of the people bade him follow him, and even laid <lb/>
            his hand upon him as if to arrest him. At this such a <lb/>
            disturbance arose as had never been known before, as <lb/>
            Camillus's party endeavoured to push the officer down from <lb/>
            the tribunal, while the people clamoured to him to drag <lb/>
            the dictator from his seat. Camillus himself, not knowing <lb/>
            what to do, would not lay down his office, but called the <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            Senate to meet. Before entering the Senate house, he <lb/>
            turned round to the Capitol and prayed that the gods <lb/>
            would bring affairs to a happy termination, vowing that <lb/>
            when the present disorders were at an end he would build <lb/>
            a Temple of Concord. After a violent debate, the Senate <lb/>
            agreed to adopt the milder course of yielding to the popular <lb/>
            demand, and permitting one of the two consuls to be chosen <lb/>
            from the people. When the dictator announced this <lb/>
            decision ofthe Senate to the people, they at once, as was <lb/>
            natural, were delighted with the Senate, and escorted <lb/>
            Camillus home with applause and shouts. On the next <lb/>
            day they met and decreed that the Temple of Concord <lb/>
            which Camillus had vowed should be erected on a spot <lb/>
            facing the Forum, where these events had taken place ; <lb/>
            moreover, that the Latin games should continue for four <lb/>
            days instead of three, and that all citizens of Rome should <lb/>
            at once offer sacrifice and crown themselves with garlands.</p>
          <p>In the assembly for the election of consuls, over which <lb/>
            Camillus presided there were elected Marcus Æmilius, a <lb/>
            patrician, and Lucius Sextius, the first plebeian ever elected <lb/>
            consul. This was the result of Camillus's administration.</p>
          <p>XLIII. In the following year a pestilence broke out <lb/>
            in Rome which destroyed enormous numbers of people, <lb/>
            and among them most of the leading men. And in this <lb/>
            year died Camillus, at a ripe old age, full of years and <lb/>
            honours, more regretted by the Romans than all those <lb/>
            who died of the plague.</p>

          <p>I. ONE day in Rome, Caesar, seeing some rich foreigners <lb/>
            nursing and petting young lapdogs and monkeys, enquired <lb/>
            whether in their parts of the world the women bore no <lb/>
            children: a truly imperial reproof to those who waste on <lb/>
            animals the affection which they ought to bestow upon <lb/>
            mankind. May we not equally blame those who waste <lb/>
            the curiosity and love of knowledge which belongs to <lb/>
            human nature, by directing it to worthless, not to useful <lb/>
            objects? It is indeed unavoidable that external objects, <lb/>
            whether good or bad, should produce some effect upon our <lb/>
            senses; but every man is able, if he chooses, to concen­ <lb/>
            trate his mind upon any subject he may please. For this <lb/>
            reason we ought to seek virtue, not merely in order to <lb/>
            contemplate it, but that we may ourselves derive some <lb/>
            benefit from so doing. Just as those colours whose <lb/>
            blooming and pleasant hues refresh our sight are grateful <lb/>
            to the eyes, so we ought by our studies to delight in that <lb/>
            which is useful for our own lives; and this is to be found <lb/>
            in the acts of good men, which when narrated incite us to <lb/>
            imitate them. The effect does not take place in other <lb/>
            cases, for we frequently admire what we do not wish to <lb/>
            produce; indeed we often are charmed with the work, but <lb/>
            despise the workman, as in the case of dyes and per­ <lb/>
            fumery which we take pleasure in, although we regard <lb/>
            dyers and perfumers as vulgar artizans. That was a clever <lb/>
            saying of Antisthenes, who answered, when he heard that <lb/>
            Ismenias was a capital flute-player, " But he must be a <lb/>
            worthless man, for if he were not, he would not be such a <lb/>
            capital flute-player! " and King Philip of Macedon, when <lb/>
            his son played brilliantly and agreeably on the harp at an <lb/>
            entertainment, said to him, " Are you not ashamed, to play <lb/>
            so well</p><pb n="253"/>
            
          <p>It is enough for a king, if he sometimes employs his <lb/>
            leisure in listening to musicians, and it is quite a sufficient <lb/>
            tribute from him to the Muses, if he is present at the <lb/>
            performances of other persons.</p>
          <p>II. If a man devotes himself to these trifling arts, the <lb/>
            time which he wastes upon them proves that he is in­ <lb/>
            capable of higher things. No well nurtured youth, on <lb/>
            seeing the statue of Jupiter Olympius at Pisa, wishes that <lb/>
            he were a Pheidias, or that he were a Polykleitus on <lb/>
            seeing the statue of Juno at Argos, nor yet while he takes <lb/>
            pleasure in poetry, does he wish that he were an Anakreon, <lb/>
            a Philetas, or an Archilochus; for it does not necessarily <lb/>
            follow that we esteem the workman because we are <lb/>
            pleased with the work. For this reason men are not <lb/>
            benefited by any spectacle which does not encourage them <lb/>
            to imitation, and where reflection upon what they have <lb/>
            observed does not make them also wish to do likewise; <lb/>
            whereas we both admire the deeds to which virtue incites, <lb/>
            and long to emulate the doers of them.</p>
          <p>We enjoy the good things which we owe to fortune, <lb/>
            but we admire virtuous actions; and while we wish to <lb/>
            receive the former, we wish ourselves to benefit others by <lb/>
            the latter. That which is in itself admirable kindles in <lb/>
            us a desire of emulation, whether we see noble deeds <lb/>
            presented before us, or read of them in history. It was <lb/>
            with this purpose that I have engaged in writing <lb/>
            biography, and have arranged this tenth book to contain <lb/>
            the lives of Perikles and of Fabius Maximus, who fought <lb/>
            against Hannibal, men who especially resembled one an­ <lb/>
            other in the gentleness and justice of their disposition, <lb/>
            and who were both of the greatest service to their native <lb/>
            countries, because they were able to endure with patience <lb/>
            the follies of their governments and colleagues. Of my <lb/>
            success, the reader of the following pages will be able to <lb/>
            judge for themself.</p>
          <p>III. Perikles was of the tribe Akamantis, and of the <lb/>
            township of Cholargos, and was descended from the noblest <lb/>
            families in Athens, on both his father's and mother's side. <lb/>
            His father, Xanthippus, defeated the Persian generals at <lb/>
            Mykale, while his mother, Agariste, was a descendant <lb/>
            of Kleisthenes, who drove the sons of Peisistratus out of <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            Athens, put an end to their despotic rule, and established <lb/>
            a new constitution admirably calculated to reconcile all <lb/>
            parties and save the country. She dreamed that she had <lb/>
            brought forth a lion, and a few days afterwards was <lb/>
            delivered of Perikles. His body was symmetrical, but his <lb/>
            head was long out of all proportion; for which reason in <lb/>
            nearly all his statues he is represented wearing a helmet, as <lb/>
            the sculptors did not wish, I suppose, to reproach him <lb/>
            with this blemish. The Attic poets called him squill­ <lb/>
            head, and the comic poet, Kratinus, in his play' Cheirones,' <lb/>
            says, <lb/>
            " From Kronos old and faction, <lb/>
            Is sprung a tyrant dread, <lb/>
            And all Olympus calls him, <lb/>
            The man-compelling he ad.' <lb/>
            And again in the play of ' Nemesis' <lb/>
            " Come, hospitable Zeus, with lofty head." <lb/>
            Telekleides, too, speaks of him as sitting <lb/>
            " Bowed down <lb/>
            With a dreadful frown, <lb/>
            Because matters of state have gone wrong, <lb/>
            Until at last, <lb/>
            From his head so vast, <lb/>
            His ideas burst forth in a throng." <lb/>
            And Eupolis, in his play of ' Demoi,' asking questions <lb/>
            about each of the great orators as they come up from the <lb/>
            other world one after the other, when at last Perikles <lb/>
            ascends, says, <lb/>
            u The great headpiece of those below."</p>
          <p>IV. Most writers tell us that his tutor in music was <lb/>
            Damon, whose name they say should be pronounced with <lb/>
            the first syllable short. Aristotle, however, says that he <lb/>
            studied under Pythokleides. This Damon, it seems, was <lb/>
            a sophist of the highest order, who used the name of <lb/>
            music to conceal this accomplishment from the world, but <lb/>
            who really trained Perikles for his political contests just <lb/>
            as a trainer prepares an athlete for the games. However, <lb/>
            Damon's use of music as a pretext did not impose upon <lb/>
            the Athenians, who banished him by ostracism, as a busy­ <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            body and lover of despotism. He was ridiculed by the <lb/>
            comic poets; thus Plato represents some one as addressing <lb/>
            him, <lb/>
            " Answer me this, I humbly do beseech, <lb/>
            For thou, like Cheiron, Perikles did'st teach."</p>
          <p>Perikles also attended the lectures of Zeno, of Elea, on <lb/>
            natural philosophy, in which that philosopher followed <lb/>
            the method of Parmenides. Zeno moreover had made an <lb/>
            especial study of how to reduce any man to silence who <lb/>
            questioned him, and how to enclose him between the <lb/>
            horns of a dilemma, which is alluded to by Timon of <lb/>
            Phlius in the following verses : <lb/>
            " Nor weak the strength of him of two-edged tongue, <lb/>
            Zeno that carps at all."</p>
          <p>But it was Anaxagoras of Klazomenæ who had most to <lb/>
            do with forming Perikles's style, teaching him an eleva­ <lb/>
            tion and sublimity of expression beyond that of ordinary <lb/>
            popular speakers, and altogether purifying and ennobling <lb/>
            his mind. This Anaxagoras was called Nous, or Intelli­ <lb/>
            gence, by the men of that day, either because they <lb/>
            admired his own intellect, or because he taught that an <lb/>
            abstract intelligence is to be traced in all the concrete <lb/>
            forms of matter, and that to this, and not to chance, the <lb/>
            universe owes its origin.</p>
          <p>V. Perikles greatly admired Anaxagoras, and became <lb/>
            deeply interested in these grand speculations, which gave <lb/>
            him a haughty spirit and a lofty style of oratory far <lb/>
            removed from vulgarity and low buffoonery, and also an <lb/>
            imperturbable gravity of countenance, and a calmness of <lb/>
            demeanour and appearance which no incident could disturb <lb/>
            as he was speaking, while the tone of his voice never <lb/>
            showed that he heeded any interruption. These advan­ <lb/>
            tages greatly impressed the people. Once he sat quietly <lb/>
            all day in the market-place despatching some pressing <lb/>
            business, reviled in the foulest terms all the while by <lb/>
            some low worthless fellow. Towards evening he walked <lb/>
            home, the man following him and heaping abuse upon <lb/>
            him. When about to enter hi own door, as it was dark, <lb/>
            he ordered one of his servants to take a torch and light <lb/>
            the man home. The poet Ion, however, says that Perikles <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            was overbearing and insolent in conversation, and that <lb/>
            his pride had in it a great deal of contempt for others; <lb/>
            while he praises Kimon's civil, sensible, and polished <lb/>
            address. But we may disregard Ion, as a mere dramatic <lb/>
            poet who always sees in great men something upon which <lb/>
            to exercise his satiric vein; whereas Zeno used to invite <lb/>
            those who called the haughtiness of Perikles a mere <lb/>
            courting of popularity and affectation of grandeur, to <lb/>
            court popularity themselves in the same fashion, since <lb/>
            the acting of such a part might insensibly mould their <lb/>
            dispositions until they resembled that of their model.</p>
          <p>VI. These were not the only advantages which Perikles <lb/>
            gained from his intimacy with Anaxagoras, but he seems <lb/>
            to have learned to despise those superstitious fears which <lb/>
            the common phenomena of the heavens produce in those <lb/>
            who, ignorant of their cause, and knowing nothing about <lb/>
            them, refer them all to the immediate action of the gods. <lb/>
            Knowledge of physical science, while it puts an end to <lb/>
            superstitious terrors, replaces them by a sound basis of <lb/>
            piety. It is said that once a ram with one horn was sent <lb/>
            from the country as a present to Perikles, and that <lb/>
            Lampon the prophet, as soon as he saw this strong horn <lb/>
            growing out of the middle of the creature's forehead, said <lb/>
            that as there were two parties in the state, that of <lb/>
            Thucydides and that of Perikles, he who possessed this <lb/>
            mystic animal would unite the two into one. Anaxagoras <lb/>
            cut open the beast's skull, and pointed out that its brain <lb/>
            did not fill the whole space, but was sunken into the <lb/>
            shape of an egg, and all collected at that part from which <lb/>
            the horn grew. At the time all men looked with admira­ <lb/>
            tion on Anaxagoras, but afterwards, when Thucydides <lb/>
            had fallen, and all the state had become united under <lb/>
            Perikles, they admired Lampon equally.</p>
          <p>There is, I imagine, no reason why both the prophet <lb/>
            and the natural philosopher should not have been right, <lb/>
            the one discovering the cause, and the other the meaning. <lb/>
            The one considered why the horn grew so, and for what <lb/>
            reason; the other declared what it meant by growing so, <lb/>
            and for what end it took place. Those who say that when <lb/>
            the cause of a portent is found out the portent is explained <lb/>
            away, do not reflect that the same reasoning which explains <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            away heavenly portents would also put an end to the <lb/>
            meaning of the conventional signals used by mankind. <lb/>
            The ringing of bells, the blaze of beacon fires, and the <lb/>
            shadows on a dial are all of them produced by natural <lb/>
            causes, but have a further meaning. But perhaps all <lb/>
            this belongs to another subject.</p>
          <p>VII. Perikles when young greatly feared the people. <lb/>
            He had a certain personal likeness to the despot Peisistratus; <lb/>
            and as his own voice was sweet, and he was ready and <lb/>
            fluent in speech, old men who had known Peisistratus <lb/>
            were struck by his resemblance to him. He was also rich, <lb/>
            of noble birth, and had powerful friends, so that he feared <lb/>
            be might be banished by ostracism, and consequently held <lb/>
            aloof from politics, but proved himself a brave and <lb/>
            daring soldier in the wars. But when Aristeides was <lb/>
            dead, Themistokles banished, and Kimon generally absent <lb/>
            on distant campaigns, Perikles engaged in public affairs, <lb/>
            taking the popular side, that of the poor and many against <lb/>
            that of the rich and few, quite contrary to his own <lb/>
            feelings, which were entirely aristocratic. He feared, it <lb/>
            seems, that he might be suspected of a design to make <lb/>
            himself despot, and seeing that Kimon took the side of the <lb/>
            nobility, and was much beloved by them, he betook him­ <lb/>
            self to the people, as a means of obtaining safety for <lb/>
            himself, and a strong party to combat that of Kimon. He <lb/>
            immediately altered his mode of life; was never seen in <lb/>
            any street except that which led to the market-place and <lb/>
            the national assembly, and declined all invitations to <lb/>
            dinner and such like social gatherings, so utterly that <lb/>
            during the whole of his long political life he never dined <lb/>
            with one of his friends except when his first cousin, <lb/>
            Euryptolemus, was married. On this occasion he sat at <lb/>
            table till the libations were poured, upon which he at once <lb/>
            got up and went away. For solemnity is wont to unbend <lb/>
            at festive gatherings, and a majestic demeanour is hard to <lb/>
            keep up when one is in familiar intercourse with others. <lb/>
            True virtue, indeed, appears more glorious the more it is <lb/>
            seen, and a really good man's life is never so much admired <lb/>
            by the outside world as by his own intimate friends. But <lb/>
            Perikles feared to make himself too common even with the <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            people, and only addressed them after long intervals—not <lb/>
            speaking upon every subject, and, not constantly addressing <lb/>
            them, but, as Kritolaus says, keeping himself like the Sala­ <lb/>
            minian trireme for great crises, and allowing his friends <lb/>
            and the other orators to manage matters of less moment. <lb/>
            One of these friends is said to have been Ephialtes, who <lb/>
            destroyed the power of the Council of the Areopagus, <lb/>
            " pouring out," as Plato, the comic poet, said, " a full <lb/>
            and unmixed draught of liberty for the citizens," under <lb/>
            the influence of which the poets of the time said that <lb/>
            the Athenian people <lb/>
            " Nibbled at Eubcea, like a horse that spurns the rein, <lb/>
            And wantonly would leap upon the islands in the main,"</p>
          <p>VIII. Wishing to adopt a style of speaking consonant <lb/>
            with his haughty manner and lofty spirit, Perikles made <lb/>
            free use of the instrument which Anaxagoras as it were <lb/>
            put into his hand, and often tinged his oratory with <lb/>
            natural philosophy. He far surpassed all others by using <lb/>
            this " lofty intelligence and power of universal con­ <lb/>
            summation," as the divine Plato calls it; in addition to <lb/>
            his natural advantages, adorning his oratory with apt <lb/>
            illustrations drawn from physical science.</p>
          <p>For this reason some think that he was nicknamed the <lb/>
            Olympian ; though some refer this to his improvement of <lb/>
            the city by new and beautiful buildings, and others from <lb/>
            his power both as a politician and a general. It is not <lb/>
            by any means unlikely that these causes all combined to <lb/>
            produce the name. Yet the comedies of that time, when <lb/>
            they allude to him, either in jest or earnest, always appear <lb/>
            to think that this name was given him because of his <lb/>
            manner of speaking, as they speak of him as " thundering <lb/>
            and lightening," and " rolling fateful thunders from his <lb/>
            tongue." A saying of Thucydides, the son of Melesias, has <lb/>
            been preserved, which jestingly testifies to the power of <lb/>
            Perikles's eloquence. Thucydides was the leader of the <lb/>
            conservative party, and for a long time struggled to hold <lb/>
            his own against Perikles in debate. One day Archidamus, <lb/>
            the King of Sparta, asked him whether he or Perikles was <lb/>
            the best wrestler. " When I throw him in wrestling," <lb/>
            Thucydides answered, " he beats me by proving that he <note type="footnote"> * Pluto, Phædrus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            never was down, and making the spectators believe him." <lb/>
            For all this Perikles was very cautious about his words, <lb/>
            and whenever he ascended the tribune to speak, used first <lb/>
            to pray to the gods that nothing unfitted for the present <lb/>
            occasion might fall from his lips. He left no writings, <lb/>
            except the measures which he brought forward, and very <lb/>
            few of his sayings are recorded. One of these was, that <lb/>
            he called Ægina " the eyesore of the Peiræus," and that <lb/>
            " he saw war coming upon Athens from Peloponnesus." <lb/>
            Stesimbrotus tells us that when he was pronouncing a <lb/>
            public funeral oration over those who fell in Samos, he <lb/>
            said that they had become immortal, even as the gods: <lb/>
            for we do not see the gods, but we conceive them to be <lb/>
            immortal by the respect which we pay them, and the <lb/>
            blessings which we receive from them; and the same is <lb/>
            the case with those who die for their country.</p>
          <p>IX. Thucydides represents the constitution under <lb/>
            Perikles as a democracy in name, but really an aristocracy, <lb/>
            because the government was all in the hands of one <lb/>
            leading citizen. But as many other writers tell us that <lb/>
            during his administration the people received grants of <lb/>
            land abroad, and were indulged with dramatic entertain­ <lb/>
            ments, and payments for their services, in consequence of <lb/>
            which they fell into bad habits, and became extravagant <lb/>
            and licentious, instead of sober hard-working people as <lb/>
            they had been before, let us consider the history of this <lb/>
            change, viewing it by the light of the facts themselves. <lb/>
            First of all, as we have already said, Perikles had to <lb/>
            measure himself with Kimon, and to transfer the affections <lb/>
            of the people from Kimon to himself. As he was not so <lb/>
            rich a man as Kimon, who used from his own ample means <lb/>
            to give a dinner daily to any poor Athenian who required <lb/>
            it, clothe aged persons, and take away the fences round his <lb/>
            property, so that any one might gather the fruit, Perikles, <lb/>
            unable to vie with him in this, turned his attention to a <lb/>
            distribution of the public funds among the people, at the <lb/>
            suggestion, we are told by Aristotle, of Damonides of Oia. <lb/>
            By the money paid for public spectacles, for citizens <lb/>
            acting as jurymen and other paid offices, and largesses, <lb/>
            he soon won over the people to his side, so that he was <lb/>
            able to use them in his attack upon the Senate of the <note type="footnote"> 1 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            Areopagus, of which he himself was not a member, never <lb/>
            having been chosen Archon, or Thesmothete, or King <lb/>
            Archon, or Polemarch. These offices had from ancient times <lb/>
            been obtained by lot, and it was only through them that <lb/>
            those who had approved themselves in the discharge of <lb/>
            them were advanced to the Areopagus. For this reason it <lb/>
            was that Perikles, when he gained strength with the <lb/>
            populace, destroyed this Senate, making Ephialtes bring <lb/>
            forward a bill which restricted its judicial powers, while <lb/>
            he himself succeeded in getting Kimon banished by ostra­ <lb/>
            cism, as a friend of Sparta and a hater of the people, <lb/>
            although he was second to no Athenian in birth or fortune, <lb/>
            had won most brilliant victories over the Persians, and <lb/>
            had filled Athens with plunder and spoils of war, as will <lb/>
            be found related in his life. So great was the power of <lb/>
            Perikles with the common people.</p>
          <p>X. One of the provisions of ostracism was that the per­ <lb/>
            son banished should remain in exile for ten years. But <lb/>
            during this period the Lacedæmonians with a great force <lb/>
            invaded the territory of Tanagra, and, as the Athenians <lb/>
            at once marched out to attack them, Kimon came back <lb/>
            from exile, took his place in full armour among the ranks <lb/>
            of his own tribe, and hoped by distinguishing himself in <lb/>
            the battle amongst his fellow citizens to prove the false­ <lb/>
            hood of the Laconian sympathies with which he had been <lb/>
            charged. However, the friends of Perikles drove him <lb/>
            away, as an exile. On the other hand, Perikles fought <lb/>
            more bravely in that battle than he had ever fought <lb/>
            before, and surpassed every one in reckless daring. The <lb/>
            friends of Kimon also, whom Perikles had accused of <lb/>
            Laconian leanings, fell, all together, in their ranks: and <lb/>
            the Athenians felt great sorrow for their treatment of <lb/>
            Kimon, and a great longing for his restoration, now that <lb/>
            they had lost a great battle on the frontier, and expected <lb/>
            to be hard pressed during the summer by the Lacedæmon­ <lb/>
            ians. Perikles, perceiving this, lost no time in gratifying <lb/>
            the popular wish, but himself proposed the decree for his <lb/>
            recall; and Kimon on his return reconciled the two States, <lb/>
            for he was on familiar terms with the Spartans, who were <lb/>
            hated by Perikles and the other leaders of the common <lb/>
            people. Some say that, before Kimon's recall by Perikles, <lb/>
            a secret compact was made with him by Elpinike, Kimono <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            sister, that Kimon was to proceed on foreign service <lb/>
            against the Persians with a fleet of two hundred ships, <lb/>
            while Perikles was to retain his power in the city. It is <lb/>
            also said that, when Kimon was being tried for his life, <lb/>
            Elpinike softened the resentment of Perikles, who was <lb/>
            one of those appointed to impeach him. When Elpinike <lb/>
            came to beg her brother's life of him, he answered with a <lb/>
            smile, " Elpinike, you are too old to meddle in affairs of <lb/>
            this sort." But, for all that, he spoke only once, for form's <lb/>
            sake, and pressed Kimon less than any of his other <lb/>
            prosecutors. How, then, can one put any faith in Idome­ <lb/>
            neus, when he accuses Perikles of procuring the assassina­ <lb/>
            tion of his friend and colleague Ephialtes, because he <lb/>
            was jealous of his reputation ? This seems an ignoble <lb/>
            calumny, which Idomeneus has drawn from some obscure <lb/>
            source to fling at a man who, no doubt, was not fault­ <lb/>
            less, but of a generous spirit and noble mind, incapable <lb/>
            of entertaining so savage and brutal a design. Ephialtes <lb/>
            was disliked and feared by the nobles, and was inexor­ <lb/>
            able in punishing those who wronged the people ; where­ <lb/>
            fore his enemies had him assassinated by means of Aristo­ <lb/>
            dikus of Tanagra. This we are told by Aristotle. Kimon <lb/>
            died in Cyprus, while in command of the Athenian forces.</p>
          <p>XI. The nobles now perceived that Perikles was the <lb/>
            most important man in the State, and far more powerful <lb/>
            than any other citizen ; wherefore, as they still hoped to <lb/>
            check his authority, and not allow him to be omnipotent, <lb/>
            they set up Thucydides, of the township of Alopekæ, as his <lb/>
            rival, a man of good sense, and a relative of Kimon, but <lb/>
            less of a warrior and more of a politician, who, by watch­ <lb/>
            ing his opportunities, and opposing Perikles in debate, <lb/>
            soon brought about a balance of power. He did not <lb/>
            allow the nobles to mix themselves up with the people in <lb/>
            the public assembly, as they had been wont to do, so that <lb/>
            their dignity was lost among the masses; but he collected <lb/>
            them into a separate body, and by thus concentrating <lb/>
            their strength was able to use it to counterbalance that of <lb/>
            the other party. From the beginning these two factions <lb/>
            had been but imperfectly welded together, because their <lb/>
            tendencies were different; but now the struggle for power <lb/>
            between Perikles and Thucydides drew a sharp line of <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            demarcation between them, and one was called the party <lb/>
            of the Many, the other that of the Few. Perikles now <lb/>
            courted the people in every way, constantly arranging <lb/>
            public spectacles, festivals, and processions in the citj , by <lb/>
            which he educated the Athenians to take pleasure in <lb/>
            refined amusements; and also he sent out sixty triremes to <lb/>
            cruise every year, in which many of the people served for <lb/>
            hire for eight months, learning and practising seamanship. <lb/>
            Besides this he sent a thousand settlers to the Chersonese, <lb/>
            five hundred to Naxos, half as many to Andros, a thousand <lb/>
            to dwell among the Thracian tribe of the Bisaltæ, and <lb/>
            others to the new colony in Italy founded by the city of <lb/>
            Sybaris, which was named Thurii. By this means he <lb/>
            relieved the state of numerous idle agitators, assisted the <lb/>
            necessitous, and overawed the allies of Athens by placing <lb/>
            his colonists near them to watch their behaviour.</p>
          <p>XII. The building of the temples, by which Athens was <lb/>
            adorned, the people delighted, and the rest of the world as­ <lb/>
            tonished, and which now alone prove that the tales of the <lb/>
            ancient power and glory of Greece are no fables, was <lb/>
            what particularly excited the spleen of the opposite faction, <lb/>
            who inveighed against him in the public assembly, declaring <lb/>
            that the Athenians had disgraced themselves by trans­ <lb/>
            ferring the common treasury of the Greeks from the island of <lb/>
            Delos to their own custody. " Perikles himself," they urged, <lb/>
            " has taken away the only possible excuse for such an act <lb/>
            -the fear that it might be exposed to the attacks of the <lb/>
            Persians when at Delos, whereas it would be safe at Athens. <lb/>
            Greece has been outraged, and feels itself openly tyran­ <lb/>
            nised over, when it sees us using the funds which we <lb/>
            extorted from it for the war against the Persians, for <lb/>
            gilding and beautifying our city, as if it were a vain <lb/>
            woman, and adorning it with precious marbles, and statues, <lb/>
            and temples, worth a thousand talents." To this Perikles <lb/>
            replied, that the allies had no right to consider how their <lb/>
            money was spent, so long as Athens defended them from <lb/>
            the Persians ; while they supplied neither horses, ships, nor <lb/>
            men, but merely money, which the Athenians had a right <lb/>
            to spend as they pleased, provided they afforded them <lb/>
            that security which it purchased. It was right, he <lb/>
            argued, that, after the city had provided all that was <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            necessary for war, it should devote its surplus money to <lb/>
            the erection of buildings which would be a glory to it for <lb/>
            all ages, while these works would create plenty by leaving <lb/>
            no man unemployed, and encouraging all sorts of handi­ <lb/>
            craft, so that nearly the whole city would earn wages, and <lb/>
            thus derive both its beauty and its profit from itself. For <lb/>
            those who were in the flower of their age, military service <lb/>
            offered a means of earning money from the common stock; <lb/>
            while, as he did not wish the mechanics and lower classes to <lb/>
            be without their share, nor yet to see them receive it without <lb/>
            doing work for it, he had laid the foundations of great <lb/>
            edifices which would require industries of every kind to <lb/>
            complete them; and he had done this in the interests of the <lb/>
            lower classes, who thus, although they remained at home, <lb/>
            would have just as good a claim to their share of the <lb/>
            public funds as those who were serving at sea, in garrison, <lb/>
            or in the field. The different materials used, such as <lb/>
            stone, brass, ivory, gold, ebony, cypress-wood, and so <lb/>
            forth, would require special artizans for each, such as car­ <lb/>
            penters, modellers, smiths, stone masons, dyers, melters <lb/>
            and moulders of gold, and ivory painters, embroiderers, <lb/>
            workers in relief; and also men to bring them to the <lb/>
            city, such as sailors and captains of ships and pilots for <lb/>
            such as came by sea; and, for those who came by land, <lb/>
            carriage builders, horse breeders, drivers, rope makers, <lb/>
            linen manufacturers, shoemakers, road menders, and <lb/>
            miners. Each trade, moreover, employed a number of <lb/>
            unskilled labourers, so that, in a word, there would be <lb/>
            work for persons of every age and every class, and general <lb/>
            prosperity would be the result.</p>
          <p>XIII. These buildings were of immense size, and <lb/>
            unequalled in beauty and grace, as the workmen endea­ <lb/>
            voured to make the execution surpass the design in beauty ; <lb/>
            but what was most remarkable was the speed with which <lb/>
            they were built. All these edifices, each of which one <lb/>
            would have thought, it would have taken many generations <lb/>
            to complete, were all finished during the most brilliant <lb/>
            period of one man's administration. We are told that <lb/>
            Zeuxis, hearing Agatharchus, the painter, boasting how <lb/>
            easily and rapidly he could produce a picture, said, <lb/>
            " I paint very slowly." Ease, and speed of execution, <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            seldom produces work of any permanent value or delicacy. <lb/>
            It is the time which is spent in laborious production <lb/>
            for which we are repaid by the durable character of the <lb/>
            result. And this makes Perikles's work all the more <lb/>
            wonderful, because it was built in a short time, and yet <lb/>
            has lasted for ages. In beauty each of them at once <lb/>
            appeared venerable as soon as it was built; but even at <lb/>
            the present day the work looks as fresh as ever, for <lb/>
            they bloom with an eternal freshness which defies time, <lb/>
            and seems to make the work instinct with an unfading <lb/>
            spirit of youth.</p>
          <p>The overseer and manager of the whole was Pheidias, <lb/>
            although there were other excellent architects and work­ <lb/>
            men, such as Kallikrates and Iktinus, who built the <lb/>
            Parthenon on the site of the old Hokatompedon, which <lb/>
            had been destroyed by the Persians, and Korœbus, who <lb/>
            began to build the Temple of Initiation at Eleusis, but <lb/>
            who only lived to see the columns erected and the archi­ <lb/>
            traves placed upon them. On his death, Metagenes, of <lb/>
            Xypete, added the frieze and the upper row of columns, <lb/>
            and Xenokles, of Cholargos, crowned it with the domed <lb/>
            roof over the shrine. As to the long wall, about which <lb/>
            Sokrates says that he heard Perikles bring forward a <lb/>
            motion, Kallikrates undertook to build it. Kratinus <lb/>
            satirises the work for being slowly accomplished, saying <lb/>
            " He builds in speeches, but he does no work." <lb/>
            The Odeum, which internally consisted of many rows <lb/>
            of seats and many columns, and externally of a roof <lb/>
            sloping on all sides from a central point, was said to have <lb/>
            been built in imitation of the king of Persia's tent, and <lb/>
            was built under Perikles's direction. For this reason <lb/>
            Kratinus alludes to him in his play of the ' Thracian <lb/>
            Woman'— <lb/>
            " Our Jove with lofty skull appears; <lb/>
            The Odeum on his head he bears, <lb/>
            Because he fears the oyster-shell no more."</p>
          <p>Perikles at that period used his influence to pass a <lb/>
            decree for establishing a musical competition at the <lb/>
            Panathenaio festival; and, being himself chosen judge, he <lb/>
            laid down rules as to how the candidates were to sing, and <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            play the flute or the harp. At that period, and ever <lb/>
            afterwards, all musical contests took place in the Odeum.</p>
          <p>The Propylæa, before the Acropolis, were finished in <lb/>
            five years, by Mnesikles the architect; and a miraculous <lb/>
            incident during the work seemed to show that the goddess <lb/>
            did not disapprove, but rather encouraged and assisted <lb/>
            the building. The most energetic and active of the work­ <lb/>
            men fell from a great height, and lay in a dangerous <lb/>
            condition, given over by his doctors. Perikles grieved <lb/>
            much for him; but the goddess appeared to him in a dream, <lb/>
            and suggested a course of treatment by which Perikles <lb/>
            quickly healed the workman. In consequence of this, <lb/>
            he set up the brazen statue of Athene the Healer, near <lb/>
            the old altar in the Acropolis. The golden statue of the <lb/>
            goddess was made by Pheidias, and his name appears upon <lb/>
            the basement in the inscription. Almost everything was <lb/>
            in his hands, and he gave his orders to all the workmen <lb/>
            -as we have said before-because of his friendship with <lb/>
            Perikles. This led to their both being envied and belied ; <lb/>
            for it was said that Perikles, with the connivance of <lb/>
            Pheidias, carried on intrigues with Athenian ladies, who <lb/>
            came ostensibly to see the works. This accusation was <lb/>
            taken up by the comic poets, who charged him with great <lb/>
            profligacy, hinting that he had an improper passion for <lb/>
            the wife of Menippus, his friend, and a lieutenant-general <lb/>
            in the army. Even the bird-fancying of Pyrilampes, <lb/>
            because he was a friend of Perikles, was misrepresented, <lb/>
            and he was said to give peacocks to the ladies who granted <lb/>
            their favours to Perikles. But, indeed, how can we wonder <lb/>
            at satirists bringing foul accusations against their betters, <lb/>
            and offering them up as victims to the spite of the populace, <lb/>
            when we find Stesimbrotus, of Thasos, actually inventing <lb/>
            that unnatural and abominable falsehood of Perikles's in­ <lb/>
            trigue with his own daughter-in-law. So hard is it to <lb/>
            discover the truth, because the history of past ages is <lb/>
            rendered difficult by the lapse of time; while in contem­ <lb/>
            porary history the truth is always obscured, either by <lb/>
            private spite and hatred, or by a desire to curry favour with <lb/>
            the chief men of the time.</p>
          <p>XIV. When the speakers of Thucydides's party com­ <lb/>
            plained that Perikles had wasted the public money, and <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            destroyed the revenue, he asked the people in the assembly <lb/>
            whether they thought he had spent much. When they <lb/>
            answered " Very much indeed," he said in reply," Do not, <lb/>
            then, put it down to the public account, but to mine; and <lb/>
            I will inscribe my name upon all the public buildings." <lb/>
            When Perikles said this, the people, either in admiration <lb/>
            of his magnificence of manner, or being eager to bear then <lb/>
            share in the glory of the new buildings, shouted to him <lb/>
            with one accord to take what money he pleased from the <lb/>
            treasury, and spend it as he pleased, without stint. And <lb/>
            finally, he underwent the trial of ostracism with Thucy­ <lb/>
            dides, and not only succeeded in driving him into exile, <lb/>
            but broke up his party.</p>
          <p>XV. As now there was no opposition to encounter in <lb/>
            the city, and all parties had been blended into one, Perikles <lb/>
            undertook the sole administration of the home and foreign <lb/>
            affairs of Athens, dealing with the public revenue, the <lb/>
            army, the navy, the islands and maritime affairs, and the <lb/>
            great sources of strength which Athens derived from her <lb/>
            alliances, as well with Greek as with foreign princes <lb/>
            and states. Henceforth he became quite a different man : <lb/>
            he no longer gave way to the people, and ceased to watch <lb/>
            the breath of popular favour; but he changed the loose <lb/>
            and licentious democracy, which had hitherto existed, <lb/>
            into a stricter aristocratic, or rather monarchical, form of <lb/>
            government. This he used honourably and unswervingly <lb/>
            for the public benefit, finding the people, as a rule, <lb/>
            willing to second the measures which he explained to <lb/>
            them to be necessary, and to which he asked their consent, <lb/>
            but occasionally having to use violence, and to force them, <lb/>
            much against their will, to do what was expedient; like <lb/>
            a physician dealing with some complicated disorder, who <lb/>
            at one time allows his patient innocent recreation, and at <lb/>
            another inflicts upon him sharp pains and bitter, though <lb/>
            salutary, draughts. Every possible kind of disorder was <lb/>
            to be found among a people possessing so great an empire <lb/>
            as the Athenians; and he alone was able to bring them <lb/>
            into harmony, by playing alternately upon their hopes <lb/>
            and fears, checking them when over-confident, and raising <lb/>
            their spirits when they were cast down and disheartened. <lb/>
            Thus, a* Plato says, he was able to prove that oratory is <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            the art of influencing men's minds, and to use it in its <lb/>
            highest application, when it deals with men's passions <lb/>
            and characters, which, like certain strings of a musical <lb/>
            instrument, require a skilful and delicate touch. The <lb/>
            secret of his power is to be found, however, as Thucydides <lb/>
            says, not so much in his mere oratory, as in his pure and <lb/>
            blameless life, because he was so well known to be incor­ <lb/>
            ruptible, and indifferent to money; for though he made <lb/>
            the city, which was a great one, into the greatest and <lb/>
            richest city of Greece, and though he himself became more <lb/>
            more powerful than many independent sovereigns, who <lb/>
            were able to leave their kingdoms to their sons, yet <lb/>
            Perikles did not increase by one single drachma the <lb/>
            estate which he received from his father.</p>
          <p>XVI. This is the clear account of his power which is <lb/>
            given by Thucydides the historian; though the comic <lb/>
            poets misrepresent him atrociously, calling his immediate <lb/>
            followers the New Peisistratidæ, and calling upon him to <lb/>
            swear that he never would make himself despot, as though <lb/>
            his pre-eminence was not to be borne in a free state. <lb/>
            And Telckleides says, that the Athenians delivered up <lb/>
            into his hands <lb/>
            " The tribute from the towns, the towns themselves, <lb/>
            The city walls, to build or to destroy, <lb/>
            The right of making either peace or war, <lb/>
            And all the wealth and produce of the land." <lb/>
            And all this was not on any special occasion, or when <lb/>
            his administration was especially popular, but for forty <lb/>
            years he held the first place among such men as Ephialtes, <lb/>
            Leokrates, Myronides, Kimon, Tolmides, and Thucydides; <lb/>
            and, after the fall and banishment of Thucydides by <lb/>
            ostracism, he united in himself for five-and-twenty years <lb/>
            all the various offices of state, which were supposed to last <lb/>
            only for one year ; and yet during the whole of that period <lb/>
            proved himself incorruptible by bribes. As to his paternal <lb/>
            estate, he was loth to lose it, and still more to be troubled <lb/>
            with the management of it; consequently, he adopted <lb/>
            what seemed to him the simplest and most exact method <lb/>
            of dealing with it. Every year's produce was sold all <lb/>
            together, and with the money thus obtained, he would <lb/>
            buy what was necessary for his household in the market, <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            and thus regulate his expenditure. This did not make <lb/>
            him popular with iiis sons when they grew up; nor yet <lb/>
            did the women of his family think him a liberal manager, <lb/>
            but blamed his exact regulation of his daily expenses, <lb/>
            which allowed none of the superfluities common in great <lb/>
            and wealthy households, but which made the debit and <lb/>
            credit exactly balance each other. One servant, Euan­ <lb/>
            gelos, kept all his accounts, as no one else had either <lb/>
            capacity or education enough to be able to do so. These <lb/>
            proceedings differed greatly from those of Anaxagoras <lb/>
            the philosopher, who left his house, and let his estate go <lb/>
            to ruin, while he pursued his lofty speculations. I con­ <lb/>
            ceive, however, that the life of a philosopher and that of a <lb/>
            practical politician are not the same, as the one directs <lb/>
            his thoughts to abstract ideas, while the other devotes his <lb/>
            genius to supplying the real wants of mankind, and in <lb/>
            some cases finds wealth not only necessary, but most <lb/>
            valuable to him, as indeed it was to Perikles, who assisted <lb/>
            many of the poorer citizens. It is said that, as Perikles <lb/>
            was engaged in public affairs, Anaxagoras, who was now <lb/>
            an old man and in want, covered his head with his robe, <lb/>
            and determined to starve himself to death; but when <lb/>
            Perikles heard of this, he at once ran to him, and besought <lb/>
            him to live, lamenting, not Anaxagoras's fate, but his own, <lb/>
            if he should lose so valuable a political adviser. Then <lb/>
            Anaxagoras uncovered his head, and said to him, " Perikles, <lb/>
            those who want to use a lamp supply it with oil."</p>
          <p>XVII. As the Lacedæmonians began to be jealous of <lb/>
            the prosperity of the Athenians, Perikles, wishing to raise <lb/>
            the spirit of the people and to make them feel capable of <lb/>
            immense operations, passed a decree, inviting all the <lb/>
            Greeks, whether inhabiting Europe or Asia, whether <lb/>
            living in large cities or small ones, to send represen­ <lb/>
            tatives to a meeting at Athens to deliberate about the <lb/>
            restoration of the Greek temples which had been burned <lb/>
            by the barbarians, about the sacrifices which were due in <lb/>
            consequence of the vows which they had made to the <lb/>
            gods on behalf of Greece before joining battle, and about <lb/>
            the sea, that all men might be able to sail upon it in peace <lb/>
            and without fear. To carry out this decree twenty men, <lb/>
            selected from the citizens over fifty years of age, were <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            sent out, five of whom invited the Ionian and Dorian <lb/>
            Greeks in Asia and the islands as far as Lesbos and <lb/>
            Rhodes, five went to the inhabitants of the Hellespont <lb/>
            and Thrace as far as Byzantium, and five more proceeded <lb/>
            to Bœotia, Phokis, and Peloponnesus, passing from thence <lb/>
            through Lokris to the neighbouring continent as far as <lb/>
            Akarnania and Ambrakia ; while the remainder journeyed <lb/>
            through Eubœa to the Œtæans and the Malian gulf, and <lb/>
            to the Achaians of Phthia and the Thessalians, urging <lb/>
            them to join the assembly and take part in the deliber­ <lb/>
            ations concerning the peace and well-being of Greece. <lb/>
            However, nothing was effe ted, and the cities never assem­ <lb/>
            bled, in consequence it is said of the covert hostility of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, and because the attempt was first <lb/>
            made in Peloponnesus and failed there: yet I have in­ <lb/>
            serted an account of it in order to show the lofty spirit <lb/>
            and the magnificent designs of Perikles.</p>
          <p>XVIII. In his campaigns he was chiefly remarkable for <lb/>
            caution, for ho would not, if he could help it, begin a <lb/>
            battle of which the issue was doubtful; nor did he wish to <lb/>
            emulate those generals who have won themselves a great <lb/>
            reputation by running risks, and trusting to good luck. <lb/>
            But he ever used to say to his countrymen, that none of <lb/>
            them should come by their deaths through any act of his. <lb/>
            Observing that Tolmides, the son of Tolmæus, elated by <lb/>
            previous successes and by the credit which he had gained <lb/>
            as a general, was about to invade Bœotia in a reckless <lb/>
            manner, and had persuaded a thousand young men to <lb/>
            follow him without any support whatever, he endeavoured <lb/>
            to stop him, and made that memorable saying in the <lb/>
            public assembly, that if Tolmides would not take the ad­ <lb/>
            vice of Perikles, he would at any rate do well to consult <lb/>
            that best of advisers, Time. This speech had but little <lb/>
            success at the time; but when, a few days afterwards, the <lb/>
            news came that Tolmides had fallen in action at Koronea, <lb/>
            and many noble citizens with him, Perikles was greatly <lb/>
            respected and admired as a wise and patriotic man.</p>
          <p>XIX. His most successful campaign was that in the <lb/>
            Chersonesus, which proved the salvation of the Greeks <lb/>
            residing there: for he not only settled a thousand colonists <lb/>
            there, and thus increased the available force of the cities, <lb/>
            but built a continuous line of fortifications reaching across <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            the isthmus from one sea to the other, by which he shut off <lb/>
            the Thracians, who had previously ravaged the peninsula, <lb/>
            and put an end to a constant and harassing border war­ <lb/>
            fare to which the settlers were exposed, as they had for <lb/>
            neighbours tribes of wild plundering barbarians.</p>
          <p>But that by which he obtained most glory and renown <lb/>
            was when he started from Pegæ, in the Megarian territory, <lb/>
            and sailed round the Peloponnesus with a fleet of a hundred <lb/>
            triremes; for he not only laid waste much of the country <lb/>
            near the coast, as Tolmides had previously done, but he <lb/>
            proceeded far inland, away from his ships, leading the <lb/>
            troops who were on board, and terrified the inhabitants so <lb/>
            much that they shut themselves up in their strongholds. <lb/>
            The men of Sikyon alone ventured to meet him at Nemea, <lb/>
            and them he overthrew in a pitched battle, and erected a <lb/>
            trophy. Next he took on board troops from the friendly <lb/>
            district of Achaia, and, crossing over to the opposite side <lb/>
            of the Corinthian Gulf, coasted along past the mouth of the <lb/>
            river Achelous, overran Akarnania, drove the people of <lb/>
            Œneadæ to the shelter of their city walls, and after rava­ <lb/>
            ging the country returned home, having made himself a <lb/>
            terror to his enemies, and done good service to Athens ; for <lb/>
            not the least casualty, even by accident, befel the troops <lb/>
            under his command.</p>
          <p>XX. When he sailed into the Black Sea with a great <lb/>
            and splendidly equipped fleet, he assisted the Greek <lb/>
            cities there, and treated them with consideration; and <lb/>
            showed the neighbouring savage tribes and their chiefs <lb/>
            the greatness of his force, and his confidence in his power, <lb/>
            by sailing where he pleased, and taking complete control <lb/>
            over that sea. He left at :Sinope thirteen ships, and a <lb/>
            land force under the command of Lamachus, to act against <lb/>
            Timesileon, who had made himself despot of that city. <lb/>
            When he and his party were driven out, Perikles passed a <lb/>
            decree that six hundred Athenian volunteers should sail <lb/>
            to Sinope, and become citizens there, receiving the houses <lb/>
            and lands which had formerly been in the possession of <lb/>
            the despot and his party. But in other cases he would <lb/>
            not agree to the impulsive proposals of the Athenians, <lb/>
            and he opposed them when, elated by their power and <lb/>
            good fortune, they talked of recovering Egypt and attack­ <lb/>
            ing the seaboard of the Persian empire. Many, too, were <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            inflamed with that ill-starred notion of an attempt on <lb/>
            Sicily, which was afterwards blown into a flame by Alki­ <lb/>
            biades and other orators Some even dreamed of the con­ <lb/>
            quest of Etruria and Carthage, in consequence of the <lb/>
            greatness which the Athenian empire had already reached, <lb/>
            and the full tide of success which seemed to attend it.</p>
          <p>XXI. Perikles, however, restrained these outbursts, and <lb/>
            would not allow the people to meddle with foreign states, <lb/>
            but used the power of Athens chiefly to preserve and guard <lb/>
            her already existing empire, thinking it to be of paramount <lb/>
            importance to oppose the Lacedæmonians, a task to which <lb/>
            he bent all his energies, as is proved by many of his acts, <lb/>
            especially in connection with the Sacred War. In this <lb/>
            war the Lacedæmonians sent a force to Delphi, and made <lb/>
            the Phokæans, who held it, give it up to the people of <lb/>
            Delphi: but as soon as they were gone 1 'erikles made an <lb/>
            expedition into the country, and restored the temple to the <lb/>
            Phokæans; and as the Lacedæmonians had scratched <lb/>
            the oracle which the Delphians had given them, on the <lb/>
            forehead of the brazen wolf there, Perikles got a response <lb/>
            from the oracle for the Athenians, and carved it on the <lb/>
            right side of the same wolf.</p>
          <p>XXII. Events proved that Perikles was right in con­ <lb/>
            fining the Athenian empire to Greece. First of all Eubœa <lb/>
            revolted, and he was obliged to lead an army to subdue <lb/>
            that island. Shortly after this, news came that the <lb/>
            Megarians had become hostile, and that an army, under <lb/>
            the command of Pleistoanax, king of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            was menacing the frontier of Attica. Perikles now in all <lb/>
            haste withdrew his troops from Eubœa, to meet the in­ <lb/>
            vader. He did not venture on an engagement with the <lb/>
            numerous and warlike forces of the enemy, although <lb/>
            repeatedly invited by them to fight: but, observing that <lb/>
            Pleistoanax was a very young man, and entirely under <lb/>
            the influence of Kleandrides, whom the Ephors had sent <lb/>
            to act as his tutor and counsellor because of his tender <lb/>
            years, he opened secret negotiations with the latter, who <lb/>
            at once, for a bribe, agreed to withdraw the Peloponnesians <lb/>
            from Attica. When their army returned and dispersed, <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians were so incensed that they imposed <lb/>
            a fine on their king, and condemned Kleandrides, who <lb/>
            fled the country, to be put to death. This Kleandrides <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            was the father of Gylippus, who caused the ruin of the <lb/>
            Athenian expedition in Sicily. Avarice seems to have <lb/>
            been hereditary in the family, for Gylippus himself, after <lb/>
            brilliant exploits in war, was convicted of taking bribes, <lb/>
            and banished from Sparta in disgrace. This is more fully <lb/>
            set forth in the Life of I ysander.</p>
          <p>XXIII. When Perikles submitted the accounts of the <lb/>
            campaign to the people, there was an item of ten talents, <lb/>
            " for a necessary purpose," which the people passed <lb/>
            without any questioning, or any curiosity to learn the <lb/>
            secret. Some historians, amongst whom is Theophrastus <lb/>
            the philosopher, say that Petikles sent ten talents an­ <lb/>
            nually to Sparta, by means of which he bribed the chief <lb/>
            magistrates to defer the war, thus not buying peace, but <lb/>
            time to make preparations for a better defence. He <lb/>
            immediately turned his attention to the insurgents in <lb/>
            Eubœa, and proceeding thither with a fleet of fifty sail, and <lb/>
            five thousand heavy armed troops, he reduced their cities <lb/>
            to submission. He banished from Chalkis the " equestrian <lb/>
            order," as it was called, consisting of men of wealth and <lb/>
            station ; and he drove all the inhabitants of Hestiæa out <lb/>
            of their country, replacing them by Athenian settlers.</p>
          <p>He treated these people with this pitiless severity, <lb/>
            because they had captured an Athenian ship, and put its <lb/>
            crew to the sword.</p>
          <p>XXIV. After this, as the Athenians and Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            made a truce for thirty years, Perikles decreed the ex­ <lb/>
            pedition against Samos, on the pretext that they had <lb/>
            disregarded the commands of the Athenians, to cease from <lb/>
            their war with the Milesians. It was thought that he began <lb/>
            this war with the Samians to please Aspasia, and this is, <lb/>
            therefore, a good opportunity to discuss that person's <lb/>
            character, and how she possessed so great influence and <lb/>
            ability that the leading politicians of the day were at her <lb/>
            feet, while philosophers discussed and admired her dis­ <lb/>
            course. It is agreed that she was of Milesian origin, and <lb/>
            that her father's name was Axiochus; and she is said to <lb/>
            have reserved her favours for the most powerful personages <lb/>
            in Greece, in imitation of Thargelia, an Ionian lady of <lb/>
            ancient times, of great beauty, ability, and attractions, <lb/>
            who had many lovers among the Greeks, and brought <lb/>
            them all over to the Persian interest, by which means <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            the seeds of the Persian faction were sown in many cities <lb/>
            of Greece, as they were all men of great influence and <lb/>
            position.</p>
          <p>Now some writers say that Perikles valued Aspasia <lb/>
            only for her wisdom and political ability. Indeed Sokrateb <lb/>
            and his friends used to frequent her society; and those <lb/>
            who listened to her discourse used to bring their wives <lb/>
            with them, that they too might profit by it, although <lb/>
            her profession was far from being honourable or decent, <lb/>
            for she kept courtesans in her house. Æschines says that <lb/>
            Lysikles, the sheep dealer, a low-born and low-minded <lb/>
            man, became one of the first men in Athens, because he <lb/>
            lived with Aspasia after Perikles's death. In Plato's <lb/>
            dialogue too, called ' Menexenus,' though the first part is <lb/>
            written in a humorous style, yet there is in it thus much <lb/>
            of serious truth, that she was thought to discuss questions <lb/>
            of rhetoric with many Athenians. But Perikles seems to <lb/>
            have been more enamoured of Aspasia's person than her <lb/>
            intellect. He was married to a woman who was nearly <lb/>
            related to him, who had previously been the wife of <lb/>
            Hipponikns, by whom she became the mother of Kallias <lb/>
            the rich. By her Perikles had two sons, Xanthippus and <lb/>
            Paralus; but afterwards, as they could not live com­ <lb/>
            fortably together, he, at his wife's wish, handed her over <lb/>
            to another husband, and himself lived with Aspasia, of <lb/>
            whom he was passionately fond. It is said that he never <lb/>
            went in or out of his house during the day without kissing <lb/>
            her. In the comedies of the time, she is spoken of as <lb/>
            the new Omphale and as Deianeira, and sometimes as <lb/>
            Hera (Juno). <unclear>Kratinor</unclear> plainly speaks of her as a harlot <lb/>
            in the following lines : <lb/>
            " To him Vice bore a Juno new, <lb/>
            Aspasia, shameless harlot." <lb/>
            He is thought to have had a bastard son by her, who is <lb/>
            mentioned by Eupolis in his play of ' The Townships,' <lb/>
            where Perikles is introduced, asking, " Lives then my <lb/>
            eon ? " to which Myronides answers : <lb/>
            " He lives, and long had claimed a manly name, <lb/>
            But that he feared his harlot mother's shame." <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            It is said that Aspasia became so illustrious and well <lb/>
            known that the Cyrus who fought with his brother for <lb/>
            the empire of Persia, called his favourite concubine <lb/>
            Aspasia, though she had before been named Milto. She <lb/>
            was a Phokæan by birth, the daughter of Hermotimus. <lb/>
            After the death of Cyrus in battle, she was taken into <lb/>
            the king's harem, and acquired great influence with him. <lb/>
            These particulars about Aspasia occurred to my memory, <lb/>
            and I thought that perhaps I might please my readers by <lb/>
            relating them.</p>
          <p>XXV. Perikles is accused of going to war with Samoa <lb/>
            to save the Milesians, at the request of Aspasia. These <lb/>
            States were at war about the possession of the city of <lb/>
            Priene, and the Samians, who were victorious, would not <lb/>
            lay down their arms and allow the Athenians to settle <lb/>
            the matter by arbitration, as they ordered them to do. <lb/>
            For this reason Perikles proceeded to Samos, put an end <lb/>
            to the oligarchical form of government there, and sent <lb/>
            fifty hostages and as many children to Lemnos, to ensure <lb/>
            the good behaviour of the leading men. It is said that <lb/>
            each of these hostages offered him a talent for his own <lb/>
            freedom, and that much more was offered by that party <lb/>
            which was loth to see a democracy established in the <lb/>
            city. Besides all this, Pissuthnes the Persian, who had a <lb/>
            liking for the Samians, sent and offered him ten thousand <lb/>
            pieces of gold if he would spare the city. Perikles, how­ <lb/>
            ever, took none of these bribes, but dealt with Samos as <lb/>
            he had previously determined, and returned to Athens. <lb/>
            The Samians now at once revolted, as Pissuthnes managed <lb/>
            to get them back their hostages, and furnished them with <lb/>
            the means of carrying on the war. Perikles now made a <lb/>
            second expedition against them, and found them in no <lb/>
            mind to submit quietly, but determined to dispute the <lb/>
            empire of the seas with the Athenians. Perikles gained <lb/>
            a signal victory over them in a sea-fight off the Goats' <lb/>
            Island, beating a fleet of seventy ships with only forty­ <lb/>
            four, twenty of which were transports.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Simultaneously with his victory and the flight <lb/>
            of the enemy he obtained command of the harbour of <lb/>
            Samos, and besieged the Samians in their city. They, in <lb/>
            spite of their defeat, still possessed courage enough to <lb/>
            sally out and fight a battle under the walls; but soon a <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            larger force arrived from Athens, and the Samians were <lb/>
            completely blockaded.</p>
          <p>Perikles now with sixty ships sailed out of the Archi­ <lb/>
            pelago into the Mediterranean, according to the most <lb/>
            current report intending to meet the Phoenician fleet <lb/>
            which was coming to help the Samians, but, according to <lb/>
            Stesimbrotus, with the intention of attacking Cyprus, <lb/>
            which seems improbable. Whatever his intention may <lb/>
            have been, his expedition was a failure, for Melissus, the <lb/>
            son of Ithagenes, a man of culture, who was then in <lb/>
            command of the Samian forces, conceiving a contempt for <lb/>
            the small force of the Athenians and the want of ex­ <lb/>
            perience of their leaders after Perikles's departure, per­ <lb/>
            suaded his countrymen to attack them. In the battle the <lb/>
            Samians proved victorious, taking many Athenians pri­ <lb/>
            soners, and destroying many of their ships. By this <lb/>
            victory they obtained command of the sea, and were able to <lb/>
            supply themselves with more warlike stores than they had <lb/>
            possessed before. Aristotle even says that Perikles himself <lb/>
            was before this beaten by Melissus in a sea-fight. The <lb/>
            Samians branded the figure of an owl on the foreheads of <lb/>
            their Athenian prisoners, to revenge themselves for the <lb/>
            branding of their own prisoners by the Athenians with <lb/>
            the figure of a samaina. This is a ship having a beak <lb/>
            turned up like a swine's snout, but with a roomy hull, so <lb/>
            as both to carry a large cargo and sail fast. This class of <lb/>
            vessel is called samaina because it was first built at Samos <lb/>
            by Polykrates, the despot of that island. It is said that <lb/>
            the verse of Aristophanes, <lb/>
            " The Samians are a deeply lettered race," <lb/>
            alludes to this branding.</p>
          <p>XXVII. When Perikles heard of the disaster which <lb/>
            had befallen his army, he returned in all haste to assist <lb/>
            them. He beat Melissus, who came out to meet him, and, <lb/>
            after putting the enemy to rout, at once built a wall <lb/>
            round their city, preferiing to reduce it by blockade to <lb/>
            risking the lives of his countrymen in an assault. As <lb/>
            time went on the Athenians became impatient and eager <lb/>
            to fight, and it was hard to restrain their ardour. Perikles <lb/>
            divided the whole force into eight divisions, and made <lb/>
            them all draw lots. The division which drew the white <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            bean he permitted to feast and take their ease, while the <lb/>
            rest did their duty. For this reason those who are enjoy­ <lb/>
            ing themselves call it a " white day," in allusion to the <lb/>
            white bean. Ephorus tells us that Perikles made use of <lb/>
            battering engines in this siege, being attracted by their <lb/>
            novelty, and that Artemon the mechanician was present, <lb/>
            who was surnamed Periphoretus because he was lame, <lb/>
            and carried in a litter to see such of the works as required <lb/>
            his superintendence. This story is proved to be false by <lb/>
            Herakleides of Pontus, he quoting Anakreon's poems, in <lb/>
            which Artemon Periphoretus is mentioned many genera­ <lb/>
            tions before the revolt and siege of Samos. He tells us <lb/>
            that Artemon was an effeminate coward who spent most <lb/>
            of his time indoors, with two slaves holding a brazen <lb/>
            shield over his head for fear that anything should fall <lb/>
            upon it, and if he was obliged to go out, used to be carried <lb/>
            in a hammock slung so low as almost to touch the ground, <lb/>
            from which he received t he name of Periphoretus.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. In the ninth month of the siege the Samians <lb/>
            surrendered. Perikles demolished their walls, confiscated <lb/>
            their fleet, and imposed a heavy fine upon them, some <lb/>
            part of which was paid at once by the Samians, who <lb/>
            gave hostages for the payment of the remainder at fixed <lb/>
            periods. Douris, of Samos, makes a lamentable story of <lb/>
            this, accusing Perikles and the Athenians of great cruelty, <lb/>
            no mention of which is to be found in Thucydides, <lb/>
            Ephorus, or Aristotle. He obviously does not tell the <lb/>
            truth when he says that Perikles took the captains and <lb/>
            marine soldiers of each ship to the market-place at <lb/>
            Miletus, bound them to planks, and after they had been <lb/>
            so for ten days and were in a miserable state, knocked <lb/>
            them on the head with clubs and cast out their bodies <lb/>
            without burial. But Douris, even in cases where he has <lb/>
            no personal bias, prefers writing an exciting story to <lb/>
            keeping to the exact truth, and in this instance probably <lb/>
            exaggerated the sufferings of his countrymen in order to <lb/>
            gratify his dislike of the Athenians.</p>
          <p>Perikles, after the reduction of Samos, returned to <lb/>
            Athens, where he buried those who had fallen in the <lb/>
            war in a magnificent manner, and was much admired for <lb/>
            the funeral oration which, as is customary, was spoken <lb/>
            by him over the graves of his countrymen. When he <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            descended from the rostrum the women greeted him, <lb/>
            crowning him with garlands and ribbons like a victorious <lb/>
            athlete, and Elpinike drawing near to him said, " A <lb/>
            fine exploit, truly, Perikles, and well worthy of a crown, <lb/>
            to lose many of our brave fellow-citizens, not fighting <lb/>
            with Persians or Phœnicians, as my brother Kimon did, <lb/>
            but in ruining a city of men of our own blood and our <lb/>
            own allies." At these words of Elpinike, Perikles merely <lb/>
            smiled and repeated the verse of Archilochus— <lb/>
            " Too old thou art for rich perfumes." <lb/>
            Ion says that his victory over the Samians wonderfully <lb/>
            flattered his vanity. Agamemnon, he was wont to say, <lb/>
            took ten years to take a barbarian city, but he in nine <lb/>
            months had made himself master of the first and most <lb/>
            powerful city in Ionia. And the comparison was not <lb/>
            an unjust one, for truly the war was a very great under­ <lb/>
            taking, and its issue quite uncertain, since, as Thucydides <lb/>
            tells us, the Samians came very near to wresting the <lb/>
            empire of the sea from the Athenians.</p>
          <p>XXIX. After these events, as the clouds were gather­ <lb/>
            ing for the Peloponnesian war, Perikles persuaded the <lb/>
            Athenians to send assistance to the people of Korkyra, <lb/>
            who were at war with the Corinthians, and thus to attach <lb/>
            to their own hide an island with a powerful naval force, <lb/>
            at a moment when the Peloponnesians had all but de­ <lb/>
            clared war against them.</p>
          <p>When the people passed this decree, Perikles sent only <lb/>
            ten ships under the command of Lacedæmonius, the <lb/>
            son of Kimon, as if he designed a deliberate insult; for <lb/>
            the house of Kimon was on peculiarly friendly terms <lb/>
            with the Lacedæmonians. His design in sending Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonius out, against his will, and with so few ships, <lb/>
            was that if he performed nothing brilliant he might be <lb/>
            accused, even more than he was already, of leaning to <lb/>
            the side of the Spartans. Indeed, by all means in his <lb/>
            power, he always threw obstacles in the way of the <lb/>
            advancement of Kimon's family, representing that by <lb/>
            their very names they were aliens, one son being named <lb/>
            Lacedæmonius, another Thessalus, another Eleius. More­ <lb/>
            over, the mother of all three was an Arcadian.</p>
          <p>Now Perikles was much reproached for sending these <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            ten ships, which were of little value to the Korky <lb/>
            reans, and gave a great handle to his enemies to use <lb/>
            against him, and in consequence sent a larger force after <lb/>
            them to Korkyra, which arrived there after the battle. <lb/>
            The Corinthians, enraged at this, complained in the <lb/>
            congress of Sparta of the conduct of the Athenians, as did <lb/>
            also the Megarians, who said that they were excluded <lb/>
            from every market and every harbour which was in <lb/>
            Athenian hands, contrary to the ancient rights and <lb/>
            common privileges of the Hellenic race. The people <lb/>
            of iEgina also considered themselves to be oppressed and <lb/>
            ill-treated, and secretly bemoaned their grievances in the <lb/>
            ears of the Spartans, for they dared not openly bring <lb/>
            any charges against the Athenians. At this time, too, <lb/>
            Potidæa, a city subject to Athens, but a colony of Corinth, <lb/>
            revolted, and its siege materially hastened the outbreak <lb/>
            of the war. Archidamus, indeed, the king of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, sent ambassadors to Athens, was willing to <lb/>
            submit all disputed points to arbitration, and endeavoured <lb/>
            to moderate the excitement of his allies, so that war <lb/>
            probably would not have broken out if the Athenians <lb/>
            could have been persuaded to rescind their decree of ex­ <lb/>
            clusion against the Megarians, and to come to terms with <lb/>
            them. And, for this reason, Perikles, who was particu­ <lb/>
            larly opposed to this, and urged the people not to give <lb/>
            way to the Megarians, alone bore the blame of having <lb/>
            begun the war.</p>
          <p>XXX. It is said, that when an embassy arrived at <lb/>
            Athens from Lacedaemon to treat upon these matters, <lb/>
            Perikles argued that there was a law which forbade the <lb/>
            tablet, on which the decree against the Megarians was <lb/>
            written, to be taken down. " Then," said Polyalkes, one <lb/>
            of the ambassadors," do not take it down, but turn it with <lb/>
            its face to the wall; for there is no law against that! "</p>
          <p>Clever as this retort was, it had no effect on Perikles. <lb/>
            He had, it seems, some private spite at the Megarians, <lb/>
            though the ground of quarrel which he put publicly <lb/>
            forward was that the Megarians had applied to their <lb/>
            own use some of the sacred ground; and he passed a <lb/>
            decree for a herald to be sent to the Megarians, and then <lb/>
            to go on to the Lacedaemonians to complain of their <lb/>
            conduct. This decree of Perikles is worded in a candid <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            and reasonable manner; but the herald, Anthemokritus, <lb/>
            was thought to have met his death at the hands of the <lb/>
            Megarians, and Charinus passed a decree to the effect <lb/>
            that Athens should wage war against them to the death, <lb/>
            without truce or armistice ; that any Megarian found in <lb/>
            Attica should be punished with death, and that the <lb/>
            generals, when taking the usual oath for each year, should <lb/>
            swear in addition that they would invade the Megarian <lb/>
            territory twice every year; and that Anthemokritus <lb/>
            should be buried near the city gate leading into the <lb/>
            Thriasian plain, which is now called the Double Gate.</p>
          <p>Now, the Megarians say that they were not to blame <lb/>
            for the murder of Anthemokritus, and lay it upon Perikles <lb/>
            and Aspasia, quoting the hackneyed rhymes from the <lb/>
            ' Acharnians,' of Aristophanes : <lb/>
            * Some young Athenians in their drunken play, <lb/>
            From Megara Simætha stole away, <lb/>
            The men of Megara next, with angered soul, <lb/>
            Two of Aspasia's choicest harlots stole."</p>
          <p>XXXI. How the dispute originated it is hard to say, <lb/>
            but all writers agree in throwing on Perikles the blame <lb/>
            of refusing to reverse the decree. Some attribute his firm­ <lb/>
            ness to a wise calculation, saying that the demand was <lb/>
            merely made in order to try him, and that any concessions <lb/>
            would have been regarded as a sign of weakness; while <lb/>
            others say that he treated the Lacedæmonians so cavalierly <lb/>
            through pride and a desire to show his own strength. <lb/>
            But the worst motive of all, and that to which most <lb/>
            men attribute his conduct, was as follows: Pheidias, <lb/>
            the sculptor, was, as we have related, entrusted with the <lb/>
            task of producing the statue of the tutelary goddess of <lb/>
            Athens. His intimacy with Perikles, with whom he had <lb/>
            great influence, gained for him many enemies, who, <lb/>
            wishing to experiment on the temper of the people <lb/>
            towards Perikles himself, bribed Menon, one of Pheidias's <lb/>
            fellow-workmen, to seat himself in the market-place as <lb/>
            a suppliant who begged that he might receive protection <lb/>
            while he denounced and prosecuted Pheidias. The people <lb/>
            took this man under its protection, and Pheidias was <lb/>
            prosecuted before the Senate. The alleged charges of <lb/>
            theft were not proved, for Pheidias, by the advice of <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            Perikles, had originally fashioned the golden part of <lb/>
            the statue in such a manner that it could all be taken <lb/>
            off and weighed, and this Perikles bade the prosecutor <lb/>
            do on this occasion. But the glory which Pheidias ob­ <lb/>
            tained by the reality of his work made him an object <lb/>
            of envy and hatred, especially when in his sculpture of <lb/>
            the battle with the Amazons on the shield of the goddess <lb/>
            he introduced his own portrait as a bald-headed old man <lb/>
            lifting a great stone with both hands, and also a very <lb/>
            fine representation of Perikles, fighting with an Amazon. <lb/>
            The position of the hand, which was holding a spear <lb/>
            before the face of Perikles, was ingeniously devised as if <lb/>
            to conceal the portrait, which, nevertheless, could plainly <lb/>
            be seen on either side of it. For this, Pheidias was <lb/>
            imprisoned, and there fell sick and died, though some <lb/>
            say that his enemies poisoned him in order to cast sus­ <lb/>
            picion upon Perikles. At the instance of Glykon, the <lb/>
            people voted to Menon, the informer, an immunity from <lb/>
            public burdens, and ordered the generals of the State to <lb/>
            provide for the wretch's safety.</p>
          <p>XXXII. About the same time Aspasia was prosecuted <lb/>
            for impiety, at the suit of Hermippus, the comic play­ <lb/>
            wright, who moreover accused her of harbouring free-born <lb/>
            Athenian ladies, with whom Perikles carried on intrigues. <lb/>
            Also Diopeithes proposed a decree, that prosecutions should <lb/>
            be instituted against all persons who disbelieved in religion, <lb/>
            and held theories of their own about heavenly phenomena. <lb/>
            This was aimed at Perikles through the philosopher <lb/>
            Anaxagoras. As the people adopted this decree, and <lb/>
            eagerly listened to these slanderous accusations, another <lb/>
            decree was carried by Drakontides, that Perikles should <lb/>
            lay the accounts of his dealings with the public revenue <lb/>
            before the Prytanes, and that the judges should carry <lb/>
            their suffrage from the altar in the Acropolis, and go and <lb/>
            determine the cause in the city. At the motion of Hagnon <lb/>
            this part of the decree was reversed, but he succeeded in <lb/>
            having the action conducted before fifteen hundred judges, <lb/>
            in a form of trial which one might call either one for <lb/>
            theft, or taking of bribes, or for public wrong-doing. <lb/>
            Aspasia was acquitted, quite contrary to justice, according <lb/>
            to Æschines, because Perikles shed tears and made a per­ <lb/>
            sonal appeal to the judges on her behalf. He feared that <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            Anaxagoras would be convicted, and sent him out of the. <lb/>
            city before his trial commenced. And now, as he had be­ <lb/>
            come unpopular by means of Pheidias, he at once blew the <lb/>
            war into a flame, hoping to put an end to these prosecu­ <lb/>
            tions, and to restore his own personal ascendancy by involv­ <lb/>
            ing the State in important and dangerous crises, in which <lb/>
            it would have to rely for guidance upon himself alone.</p>
          <p>These are the causes which are assigned for his refusal <lb/>
            to permit the Athenians to make any concession to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, but the real history of the transaction <lb/>
            will never be known.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Now, as the Lacedaemonians knew that if he <lb/>
            could be removed from power they would find the A the­ <lb/>
            nians much more easy to deal with, they bade them <lb/>
            " drive forth the accursed thing," alluding to Perikles's <lb/>
            descent from the Alkmæonidæ by his mother's side, as <lb/>
            we are told by Thucydides the historian. But this <lb/>
            attempt had just the contrary effect to that which they <lb/>
            intended ; for, instead of suspicion and dislike, Perikles <lb/>
            met with much greater honour and respect from his <lb/>
            countrymen than before, because they saw that he was an <lb/>
            object of especial dislike to the enemy. For this reason, <lb/>
            before the Peloponnesians, under Archidamus, invaded <lb/>
            Attica, he warned the Athenians that if Archidamus, when <lb/>
            he laid waste everything else, spared his own private <lb/>
            estate because of the friendly private relations existing <lb/>
            between them, or in order to give his personal enemies a <lb/>
            ground for impeaching him, that he should give both the <lb/>
            land and the farm buildings upon it to the State.</p>
          <p>The Lacedaemonians invaded Attica with a great host <lb/>
            of their own troops and those of their allies, led by <lb/>
            Archidamus, their king. They proceeded, ravaging the <lb/>
            country as they went, as far as Acharnæ (close to Athens), <lb/>
            where they encamped, imagining that the Athenians would <lb/>
            never endure to see them there, but would be driven by <lb/>
            pride and shame to come out and fight them. However, <lb/>
            Perikles thought that it would be a very serious matter <lb/>
            to fight for the very existence of Athens against sixty <lb/>
            thousand Peloponnesian and Bœotian* heavy-armed troops, <lb/>
            and so he pacified those who were dissatisfied at his <note type="footnote"> * The Dorians of Bœotia and Peloponnesus were accounted the beat <lb/>
            infantry soldiers of Greece. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            inactivity by pointing out that trees when cut down <lb/>
            quickly grow again, but that when the men of a State are <lb/>
            lost, it is hard to raise up others to take their place. He <lb/>
            would not call an assembly of the people, because he <lb/>
            feared that they would force him to act against his better <lb/>
            judgment, but, just as the captain of a ship, when a storm <lb/>
            comes on at sea, places everything in the best trim to meet <lb/>
            it, and trusting to his own skill and seamanship, dis­ <lb/>
            regarding the tears and entreaties of the sea-sick and <lb/>
            terrified passengers; so did Perikles shut the gates of <lb/>
            Athens, place sufficient forces to ensure the safety of the <lb/>
            city at all points, and calmly carry out his own policy, <lb/>
            taking little heed of the noisy grumblings of the discon­ <lb/>
            tented. Many of his friends besought him to attack, <lb/>
            many of his enemies threatened him and abused him, <lb/>
            and many songs and offensive jests were written about <lb/>
            him, speaking of him as a coward, and one who was <lb/>
            betraying the city to its enemies. Kleon too attacked <lb/>
            him, using the anger which the citizens felt against him <lb/>
            to advance his own personal popularity, as we see from <lb/>
            the following lines of Hermippus: <lb/>
            “ King of Satyrs, wherefore fear you <lb/>
            Spear to wield, and only dare to <lb/>
            Talk in swelling phrase, while yet you <lb/>
            Cower, Teles like, <lb/>
            And when goaded on, past bearing, <lb/>
            By our Kleon's tongue so daring, <lb/>
            Only gnash your teeth despairing, <lb/>
            Still afraid to strike.10</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Perikles was unmoved by any of these attacks, <lb/>
            but quietly endured all this storm of obloquy. He sent a <lb/>
            fleet of a hundred ships to attack Peloponnesus, but did <lb/>
            not sail with it himself, remaining at home to keep a tight <lb/>
            hand over Athens until the Peloponnesians drew off their <lb/>
            forces. He regained his popularity with the common <lb/>
            people, who suffered much from the war, by giving them <lb/>
            allowances of money from the public revenue, and grants <lb/>
            of land; for he drove out the entire population of the <lb/>
            island of Ægina, and divided the land by lot among the <lb/>
            Athenians. A certain amount of relief also was ex­ <lb/>
            perienced by reflecting upon the injuries which they were <lb/>
            inflicting on the enemy; for the fleet as it sailed round <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            Peloponnesus destroyed many small villages and cities, <lb/>
            and ravaged a great extent of country, while Perikles <lb/>
            himself led an expedition into the territory of Megara <lb/>
            and laid it all waste. By this it is clear that the allies, <lb/>
            although they did much damage to the Athenians, yet <lb/>
            suffered equally themselves, and never could have pro­ <lb/>
            tracted the war for such a length of time as it really <lb/>
            lasted, but, as Perikles foretold, must soon have desisted <lb/>
            had not Providence interfered and confounded human <lb/>
            counsels. For now the pestilence fell among the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, and cut off the flower of their youth. Suffering <lb/>
            both in body and mind they raved against Perikles, just <lb/>
            as people when delirious with disease attack their fathers <lb/>
            or their physicians. They endeavoured to ruin him, <lb/>
            urged on by his personal enemies, who assured them that <lb/>
            he was the author of the plague, because he had brought <lb/>
            all the country people into the city, where they were <lb/>
            compelled to live during the heat of summer, crowded <lb/>
            together in small rooms and stifling tents, living an idle <lb/>
            life too, and breathing foul air instead of the pure country <lb/>
            breezes to which they were accustomed. The cause of <lb/>
            this, they s aid, was the man who, when the war began, <lb/>
            admitted the masses of the country people into the city, <lb/>
            and then made no use of them, but allowed them to be <lb/>
            penned up together like cattle, and transmit the contagion <lb/>
            from one to another, without devising any remedy or <lb/>
            alleviation of their sufferings.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Hoping to relieve them somewhat, and also to <lb/>
            annoy the enemy, Perikles manned a hundred and fifty <lb/>
            ships, placed on board, besides the sailors, many brave <lb/>
            infantry and cavalry soldiers, and was about to put to <lb/>
            sea. The Athenians conceived great hopes, and the enemy <lb/>
            no less terror from so large an armament. When all was <lb/>
            ready, and Perikles himself had just embarked in his own <lb/>
            trireme, an eclipse of the sun took place, producing total <lb/>
            darkness, and all men were terrified at so great a portent. <lb/>
            Perikles, observing that his helmsman was alarmed and <lb/>
            knew not what to do, held his cloak over the man's eyes <lb/>
            and asked him if he thought that a terrible portent. As <lb/>
            he answered that he did not, Perikles said: " What is the <lb/>
            difference, then, between it and an eclipse of the sun, ex­ <lb/>
            cept that the eclipse is caused by something larger than <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            my cloak ? " This subject is discussed by the philosophers <lb/>
            in their schools.</p>
          <p>Perikles sailed with the fleet, but did nothing worthy <lb/>
            of so great a force. He besieged the sacred city of <lb/>
            Epidaurus, but, although he had great hopes of taking it, <lb/>
            he failed on account of the plague, which destroyed not <lb/>
            only his own men, but every one who came in contact <lb/>
            with them. After this he again endeavoured to encourage <lb/>
            the Athenians, to whom he had become an object of dis­ <lb/>
            like. However, he did not succeed in pacifying them, <lb/>
            but they condemned him by a public vote to be general <lb/>
            no more, and to pay a fine which is stated at the lowest <lb/>
            estimate to have been fifteen talents, and at the highest <lb/>
            fifty. This was carried, according to Idomeneus, by <lb/>
            Kleon, but according to Theophrastus by Simmias; whilst <lb/>
            Herakleides of Pontus says that it was effected by <lb/>
            Lakrateides.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. He soon regained his public position, for the <lb/>
            people's outburst of anger was quenched by the blow <lb/>
            they had dealt him, just as a bee leaves its sting in the <lb/>
            wound; but his private affairs were in great distress and <lb/>
            disorder, as he had lost many of his relatives during the <lb/>
            plague, while others were estranged from him on political <lb/>
            grounds. Xanthippus too, the eldest of his legitimate <lb/>
            sons, who was a spendthrift by nature and married to a <lb/>
            woman of expensive habits, a daughter of Tisander, the <lb/>
            son of Epilykus, could not bear with his father's stingy <lb/>
            ways and the small amount of money which he allowed <lb/>
            him. He consequently sent to one of his friends and <lb/>
            borrowed money from him as if Perikles had authorised <lb/>
            him to do so. When the friend asked for his money back <lb/>
            again, Perikles prosecuted him, at which proceeding young <lb/>
            Xanthippus was enraged and abused his father, sneering at <lb/>
            his way of life and his discussions with the sophists. When <lb/>
            some athlete accidentally killed Epitimus of Pharsalus <lb/>
            with a javelin, he said that Perikles spent the whole day <lb/>
            arguing with Protagoras whether in strict accuracy the <lb/>
            javelin, or the man who threw it, or the stewards of the <lb/>
            games, ought to be considered the authors of the mishap. <lb/>
            And, besides this, Stesimbrotus tells us that Xanthippus <lb/>
            put about that scandal about his father and his own wife, <lb/>
            so that the father and son remained irreconcilable enemies <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            until Xanthippus's death, which happened during the <lb/>
            plague, by an attack of that disorder. At the same time <lb/>
            Perikles lost his sister and most of his relations, especially <lb/>
            those who supported his policy. Yet he would not yield, <lb/>
            nor abate his firmness and constancy of spirit because of <lb/>
            these afflictions, but was not observed to weep or mourn, <lb/>
            or attend the funeral of any of his relations, until he lost <lb/>
            Paralus, the last of his legitimate offspring. Crushed by <lb/>
            this blow, he tried in vain to keep up his grand air of <lb/>
            indifference, and when carrying a garland to lay upon the <lb/>
            corpse he was overpowered by his feelings, so as to burst <lb/>
            into a passion of tears and sobs, which he had never done <lb/>
            before in his whole life.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Athens made trial of her other generals and <lb/>
            public men to conduct her affairs, but none appeared to be <lb/>
            of sufficient weight or reputation to have such a charge <lb/>
            entrusted to him. The city longed for Perikles, and <lb/>
            invited him again to lead its counsels and direct its <lb/>
            armies; and he, although dejected in spirits and living <lb/>
            in seclusion in his own house, was yet persuaded by <lb/>
            Alkibiades and his other friends to resume the direction <lb/>
            of affairs. The people apologised for their ungrateful <lb/>
            treatment of him, and when he was again in office and <lb/>
            elected as general, he begged of them to be released from <lb/>
            the operations of the law of bastardy, which he himself <lb/>
            had originally introduced, in order that his name and <lb/>
            race might not altogether become extinct for want of an <lb/>
            heir. The provisions of the law were as follows :— <lb/>
            Perikles many years before, when he was at the height of <lb/>
            his power and had children born to him, as we have <lb/>
            related, of legitimate birth, proposed a law that only <lb/>
            those born of an Athenian father and mother should be <lb/>
            reckoned Athenian citizens. But when the king of <lb/>
            Egypt sent a present of forty thousand medimni of wheat <lb/>
            to be divided among the citizens, many lawsuits arose <lb/>
            about the citizenship of men whose birth had never been <lb/>
            questioned before that law came into force, and many <lb/>
            vexatious informations were laid. Nearly five thousand <lb/>
            men were convicted of illegitimacy of birth and sold for <lb/>
            slaves, while those who retained their citizenship and <lb/>
            proved themselves to be genuine Athenians amounted to <lb/>
            fourteen thousand and forty. It was indeed an unreason­ <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            able request that a law which had been enforced in so <lb/>
            many instances should now be broken in the person of its <lb/>
            own author, but Perikles's domestic misfortunes, in which <lb/>
            he seemed to have paid the penalty for his former haughti­ <lb/>
            ness and pride, touched the hearts of the Athenians so <lb/>
            much that they thought his sorrows deserving of their <lb/>
            pity, and his request such as he was entitled to make and <lb/>
            they to grant in common charity, and they consented to <lb/>
            his illegitimate son being enrolled in his own tribe and <lb/>
            bearing his own name. This man was subsequently put <lb/>
            to death by the people, together with all his colleagues, for <lb/>
            their conduct after the sea-fight at Arginusæ.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. After this it appears that Perikles was <lb/>
            attacked by the plague, not acutely or continuously, as in <lb/>
            most cases, but in a slow wasting fashion, exhibiting many <lb/>
            varieties of symptoms, and gradually undermining his <lb/>
            strength. Theophrastus, in his treatise on Ethics, dis­ <lb/>
            cusses whether a man's character can be changed by <lb/>
            disease, and whether virtue depends upon bodily health. <lb/>
            As an example, he quotes a story that Perikles, when one <lb/>
            of his friends came to visit him during his sickness, showed <lb/>
            him a charm hung round his neck, as a proof that he must <lb/>
            be indeed ill to submit to such a piece of folly. As he <lb/>
            was now on his deathbed, the most distinguished of the <lb/>
            citizens and his surviving friends collected round him and <lb/>
            spoke admiringly of his nobleness and immense power, <lb/>
            enumerating also the number of his exploits, and the <lb/>
            trophies which he had set up for victories gained; for <lb/>
            while in chief command he had won no less than nine <lb/>
            victories for Athens. They were talking thus to one <lb/>
            another in his presence, imagining that he could no longer <lb/>
            understand them, but had lost his power of attending to <lb/>
            them. He, however, was following all that they said, <lb/>
            and suddenly broke silence, saying that he was surprised <lb/>
            at their remembering and praising him for the exploits <lb/>
            which depended entirely upon fortune for their success, <lb/>
            and which many other generals had done as well as him­ <lb/>
            self, while they did not mention his greatest and most <lb/>
            glorious title to fame. “ No Athenian," said he,“ ever <lb/>
            wore black because of me."</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Perikles was to be admired, not only for his <lb/>
            gentleness and mildness of spirit, which he preserved <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            through the most violent political crises and outbreaks of <lb/>
            personal hatred to himself, but also for his lofty dispo­ <lb/>
            sition. He himself accounted it his greatest virtue that <lb/>
            he never gave way to feelings of envy or hatred, but from <lb/>
            his own exalted pinnacle of greatness never regarded any <lb/>
            man as so much his enemy that he could never be his <lb/>
            friend. This alone, in my opinion, justifies that outrageous <lb/>
            nickname of his, and gives it a certain propriety; for <lb/>
            so serene and impartial a man, utterly uncorrupt though <lb/>
            possessed of great power, might naturally be called <lb/>
            Olympian. Thus it is that we believe that the gods, who <lb/>
            are the authors of all good and of no evil to men, rule over <lb/>
            us and over all created things, not as the poets describe <lb/>
            them in their bewildering fashion, which their own poems <lb/>
            prove to be untrue. The poets describe the abode of the. <lb/>
            gods as a safe and untroubled place where no wind or <lb/>
            clouds are, always enjoying a mild air and clear light, <lb/>
            thinking such a place to be fittest for a life of immortal <lb/>
            blessedness; while they represent the gods themselves as <lb/>
            full of disorder and anger and spite and other passions, <lb/>
            which are not becoming even to mortal men of common <lb/>
            sense. These reflections, however, perhaps belong to <lb/>
            another subject.</p>
          <p>Events soon made the loss of Perikles felt and regretted <lb/>
            by the Athenians. Those who during his lifetime had <lb/>
            complained that his power completely threw them into <lb/>
            the shade, when after his death they had made trial of <lb/>
            other orators and statesmen, were obliged to confess that <lb/>
            with all his arrogance no man ever was really more <lb/>
            moderate, and that his real mildness in dealing with men <lb/>
            was as remarkable as his apparent pride and assumption. <lb/>
            His power, which had been so grudged and envied, and <lb/>
            called monarchy and despotism, now was proved to have <lb/>
            been the saving of the State ; such an amount of corrupt <lb/>
            dealing and wickedness suddenly broke out in public <lb/>
            affairs, which he before had crushed and forced to hide <lb/>
            itself, and so prevented its becoming incurable through <lb/>
            impunity and licence.</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF FABIUS MAXIMUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. SUCH a man did Perikles show himself to be in his most <lb/>
            memorable acts, as far as they are extant.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn our attention to Fabius.</p>
          <p>The first of the family is said to descend from one of the <lb/>
            nymphs, according to some writers, according to others <lb/>
            from an Italian lady who became the mother of Fabius by <lb/>
            Hercules near the river Tiber. From him descended the <lb/>
            family of the Fabii, one of the largest and most renowned in <lb/>
            Rome. Some say that the men of this race were the first to <lb/>
            use pitfalls in hunting, and were anciently named Fodii in <lb/>
            consequence; for up to the present day ditches are called <lb/>
            fossæ, and to dig is called fodere in Latin: and thus in <lb/>
            time the two sounds became confused, and they obtained <lb/>
            the name of Fabii. The family produced many dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished men, the greatest of whom was Rullus, who <lb/>
            was for that reason named Maximu6 by the Romans. <lb/>
            From him Fabius Maximus, of whom I am now writing, <lb/>
            was fourth in descent. His own personal nickname was <lb/>
            Verrucosus, because he had a little wart growing on his <lb/>
            upper lip. The name of Ovicula, signifying sheep, was <lb/>
            also given him while yet a child, because of his slow and <lb/>
            gentle disposition. He was quiet -and silent, very cautious <lb/>
            in taking part in children's games, and learned his lessons <lb/>
            slowly and with difficulty, which, combined with his easy <lb/>
            obliging ways with his comrades, made those who did not, <lb/>
            know him think that he was dull and stupid. Few there <lb/>
            were who could discern, hidden in the depths of his soul, <lb/>
            his glorious and lion-like character. Soon, however, as <lb/>
            time went on, and he began to take part in public affairs, <lb/>
            he proved that his apparent want of energy was really <lb/>
            due to serenity of intellect, that he was cautious because <lb/>
            he weighed matters well beforehand, and that while he <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            was never eager or easily moved, yet he was always <lb/>
            steady and trustworthy. Observing the immense extent <lb/>
            of the empire, and the numerous wars in which it was <lb/>
            engaged, he exercised his body in warlike exercises, <lb/>
            regarding it as his natural means of defence, while he also <lb/>
            studied oratory as the means by which to influenco the <lb/>
            people, in a style suited to his own life and character. <lb/>
            In his speeches there were no flowery passages, no empty <lb/>
            graces of style, but there was a plain common sense <lb/>
            peculiar to himself, and a depth of sententious maxims <lb/>
            which is said to have resembled Thucydides. One of his <lb/>
            speeches is extant, a funeral oration which he made in <lb/>
            public over his son who died after he had been consul.</p>
          <p>II. He was consul five times, and in his firstconsulship <lb/>
            obtaineda" triumph overthe Ligurians. They were <lb/>
            defeated by himand driven with great loss to take refuge <lb/>
            in the Alps, and thus were prevented from ravaging the <lb/>
            neighbouring parts of Italy as they had been wont to do. <lb/>
            When Hannibal invaded Italy, won his first battle at the <lb/>
            Trebia, and marched through Etruria, laying everything <lb/>
            waste, as he went, the Romans were terribly disheartened <lb/>
            and cast down, and terrible prodigies took place, some of <lb/>
            the usual kind, that is, by lightning, and others of an <lb/>
            entirely new and strange character. It was said that <lb/>
            shields of their own accord became drenched with blood: <lb/>
            that at Antium standing corn bled when it was cut by <lb/>
            the reapers; that red-hot stones fell from heaven, and <lb/>
            that the sky above Falerii was seen to open and tablets to <lb/>
            fall, on one of which was written the words " Mars is <lb/>
            shaking his arms."</p>
          <p>None of these omens had any effect upon Caius <lb/>
            Flaminius, the consul, for, besides his naturally spirited <lb/>
            and ambitious nature, he was excited by the successes <lb/>
            which he had previously won, contrary to all reasonable <lb/>
            probability. Once, against the express command of the <lb/>
            Senate, and in spite of the opposition of his colleague, he <lb/>
            engaged with the Gauls and won a victory over them. <lb/>
            Fabius also was but little disturbed by the omens, because <lb/>
            of their strange and unintelligible character, though many <lb/>
            were alarmed at them. Knowing how few the enemy <lb/>
            were in numbers, and their great want of money and <note type="footnote"> U </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            supplies, he advised the Romans not to offer battle to a <lb/>
            man who had at his disposal an army trained by many <lb/>
            previous encounters to a rare pitch of perfection, but <lb/>
            rather to send reinforcements to their allies, keep a tight <lb/>
            hand over their subject cities, and allow Hannibal's <lb/>
            brilliant little force to die away like a lamp which flares <lb/>
            up brightly with but little oil to sustain it.</p>
          <p>III. This reasoning had no effect upon Flaminius, who <lb/>
            said that he would not endure to see an enemy marching <lb/>
            upon Rome, and would not, like Camillus of old, fight in <lb/>
            the streets of Rome herself. He ordered the military <lb/>
            tribunes to put the army in motion, and himself leaped <lb/>
            upon his horse's back. The horse for no visible reason <lb/>
            shied in violent terror, and Flaminius was thrown head­ <lb/>
            long to the ground. He did not, however, alter his <lb/>
            determination, but marched to meet Hannibal, and drew <lb/>
            up his forces for battle near the lake Thrasymenus, in <lb/>
            Etruria. When the armies met, an earthquake took <lb/>
            place which destroyed cities, changed the courses of <lb/>
            rivers, and cast down the crests of precipices; but in <lb/>
            spite of its violence, no one of the combatants perceived it. <lb/>
            Flaminius himself, after many feats of strength and <lb/>
            courage, fell dead, and around him lay the bravest <lb/>
            Romans. The rest fled, and the slaughter was so great <lb/>
            that fifteen thwere killed, and as many more taken <lb/>
            prisoners. Hannibal generously desired to bury the body <lb/>
            of Flaminius with military honours, to show his esteem <lb/>
            for the consul's bravery ; but it could not be found among <lb/>
            the slain, and no one knew how it disappeared.</p>
          <p>The defeat at the Trebia had not been clearly explained <lb/>
            either by the general who wrote the despatch, or by the <lb/>
            messenger who carried it, as they falsely represented it to <lb/>
            have been a drawn battle; but as soon as the prætor <lb/>
            Pomponius heard the news of this second misfortune, he <lb/>
            assembled the people in the Forum, and said, without any <lb/>
            roundabout apologies whatever, " Romans, we have lost a <lb/>
            grea t battle, the army is destroyed, and the consul Flam­ <lb/>
            inius has fallen. Now, therefore, take counsel for your own <lb/>
            safety.” These words produced the same impression on <lb/>
            the people that a gust of wind does upon the sea. No one <lb/>
            could calmly reflect after such a sudden downfall of their <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            hopes. All, however, agreed that the State required one <lb/>
            irresponsible ruler, which the Romans call a dictatorship, <lb/>
            and a man who would fulfil this office with fearless energy. <lb/>
            Such a man, they felt, was Fabius Maximus, who was <lb/>
            sufficiently qualified for the office by his abilities and the <lb/>
            respect which his countrymen bore him, and was moreover <lb/>
            at that time of life when the strength of the body is fully <lb/>
            capable of carrying out the ideas of the mind, but when <lb/>
            courage is somewhat tempered by discretion.</p>
          <p>IV. As soon as the people had passed their decree, Fabius <lb/>
            was appointed dictator,. and appointed Marcus Minucius <lb/>
            his master of the horse. First, however, he begged of the <lb/>
            Senate to allow him the use of a horse during his cam­ <lb/>
            paigns. There was an ancient law forbidding this practice, <lb/>
            either because the main strength of the army was thought <lb/>
            to lie in the columns of infantry, and for that reason the <lb/>
            dictator ought to remain always with them, or else because, <lb/>
            while in all other respects the dictator's power is equal to <lb/>
            that of a king, it was thought well that in this one point <lb/>
            he should have to ask leave of the people. Next, however, <lb/>
            Fabius, wishing at once to show the greatness and splen­ <lb/>
            dour of his office, and so make the citizens more ready to <lb/>
            obey him, appeared in public with all his twenty-four <lb/>
            lictors at once ; and when the surviving consul met him, <lb/>
            he sent an officer to bid him dismiss his lictors, lay aside <lb/>
            his insignia of office, and come before him as a mere private <lb/>
            citizen. After this he began in the best possible way, <lb/>
            that is, by a religious ceremony, and assured the people <lb/>
            that it was in consequence of the impiety and carelessness <lb/>
            of their late general, not by any fault of the army, that <lb/>
            they had been defeated. Thus he encouraged them not to <lb/>
            fear their enemies, but to respect the gods and render them <lb/>
            propitious, not that he implanted any superstitious <lb/>
            observances among them, but he confirmed their valour <lb/>
            by piety, and took away from them all fear of the enemy <lb/>
            by the hopes which he held out to them of divine protec­ <lb/>
            tion. At this time many of the holy and mysterious books, <lb/>
            which contain secrets of great value to the State, were <lb/>
            inspected. These are called the Sibylline books. One of <lb/>
            the sentences preserved in these was said to have an <note type="footnote"> * Liv., xxii. 8, sq. </note> <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            evident bearing on contemporary events; what it was can <lb/>
            only be guessed at by what was done. The dictator <lb/>
            appeared before the people and publicly vowed to the gods <lb/>
            a ver sacrum, that is, ull the young which the next spring <lb/>
            should produce, from the goats, the sheep, and the kine on <lb/>
            every mountain, and plain, and river, and pasture within <lb/>
            the bounds of Italy. All these he swore that he would <lb/>
            sacrifice, and moreover that he would exhibit musical and <lb/>
            dramatic shows, and expend upon them the sum of three <lb/>
            hundred and thirty-three sestertia, and three hundred and <lb/>
            thirty-three denarii, and one-third of a denarius. The <lb/>
            sum total of this in our Greek money is eighty-three <lb/>
            thousand five hundred and eighty-three drachmas and two <lb/>
            obols. What the particular virtue of this exact number <lb/>
            may be it is hard to determine, unless it be on account of <lb/>
            the value of the number three, which is by nature perfect, <lb/>
            and the first of odd numbers, the first also of plurals, and <lb/>
            containing within itself all the elements of the qualities <lb/>
            of number.</p>
          <p>V. Fabius, by teaching the people to rest their hopes <lb/>
            on religion, made them view the future with a more <lb/>
            cheerful heart. For his own part, he trusted entirely to <lb/>
            himself to win the victory, believing that Heaven grants <lb/>
            men success according to the valour and conduct which <lb/>
            they display. He marched against Hannibal, not with <lb/>
            any design of fighting him, but of wearing out his army <lb/>
            by long delays, until he could, by his superior numbers <lb/>
            and resources, deal with him easily. With this object in <lb/>
            view he always took care to secure himself from Hannibal's <lb/>
            cavalry, by occupying the mountains overhanging the <lb/>
            Carthaginian camp, where he remained quiet as long as <lb/>
            the enemy did, but when they moved he used to accompany <lb/>
            them, showing himself at intervals upon the heights at <lb/>
            such a distance as not to be forced to fight against his <lb/>
            will, and yet, from the very slowness of his movements, <lb/>
            making the enemy fear that at every moment he was <lb/>
            about to attack. By these dilatory manoeuvres he incurred <lb/>
            general contempt, and was looked upon with disgust by <lb/>
            his own soldiers, while the enemy, with the exception of <lb/>
            one man, thought him utterly without warlike enterprise. <lb/>
            That man was Hannibal himself. He alone perceived <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            Fabius's true generalship and thorough comprehension of <lb/>
            the war, and saw that either he must by some means be <lb/>
            brought to fight a battle, or else the Carthaginians were <lb/>
            lost, if they could not make use of their superiority in <lb/>
            arms, but were to be worn away and reduced in number <lb/>
            and resources, in which they were already deficient. He <lb/>
            put in force every conceivable military stratagem and <lb/>
            device, like a skilful wrestler when he tries to lay hold of <lb/>
            his antagonist, and kept attacking Fabius, skirmishing <lb/>
            round him, and drawing him from place to place, in his <lb/>
            endeavours to make him quit his policy of caution. But <lb/>
            Fabius was convinced that he was right, and steadily <lb/>
            declined battle. His master of the horse, Minucius, who <lb/>
            longed for action, gave him much trouble. This man <lb/>
            made unseemly boasts, and harangued the army, filling it <lb/>
            with wild excitement and self-confidence. The soldiers <lb/>
            in derision used to call Fabius Hannibal's lacquey, because <lb/>
            he followed him wherever he went, and thought Minucius <lb/>
            a really great general, and worthy of the name of Roman. <lb/>
            Minucius, encouraged in his arrogant vauntings, began to <lb/>
            ridicule the habit of encamping on the mountain-tops, <lb/>
            saying that the dictator always took care to provide them <lb/>
            with good seats from which to behold the spectacle of the <lb/>
            burning and plundering of Italy, and used to ask the <lb/>
            friends of Fabius whether he took his army up so near <lb/>
            the sky because he had ceased to take any interest in <lb/>
            what went on on the earth below, or whether it was in <lb/>
            order to conceal it from the enemy among the clouds and <lb/>
            mists. When Fabius was informed of these insults by his <lb/>
            friends, who begged him to wipe away this disgrace by <lb/>
            risking a battle, he answered, “ If I did so, I should be <lb/>
            more cowardly than I am now thought to be, in abandoning <lb/>
            the policy which I have determined on because of men's <lb/>
            slanders and sneers. It is no shame to fear for one's <lb/>
            country, but to regard the opinions and spiteful criticisms <lb/>
            of the people would be unworthy of the high office which <lb/>
            I hold, and would show me the slave of those whom I <lb/>
            ought to govern and restrain when they would fain do <lb/>
            wrong."</p>
          <p>VI. After this, Hannibal made a blunder. Wishing to <lb/>
            move his army further from that of Fabius, and to gain <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            an open part of the country where the could obtain <lb/>
            forage, he ordered his guides one night after supper to <lb/>
            lead the way at once to Casinatum. They, misunderstand­ <lb/>
            ing him because of his foreign pronunciation, led his forces <lb/>
            to the borders of Campania, near the city of Casilinum, <lb/>
            through the midst of which flows the river Lothronus, <lb/>
            which the Romans call Vulturnus. This country is <lb/>
            full of mountains, except one valley that runs towards <lb/>
            the sea-coast, where the river at the end of its course <lb/>
            overflows into extensive marshes, with deep beds of <lb/>
            sand. The beach itself is rough and impracticable for <lb/>
            shipping.</p>
          <p>When Hannibal was marching down this valley, Fabius, <lb/>
            by his superior knowledge of the country, came up with <lb/>
            him, placed four thousand men to guard the narrow outlet, <lb/>
            established the main body in a safe position in the <lb/>
            mountains, and with the light-armed troops fell upon <lb/>
            and harassed the rear of Hannibal's army, throwing it all <lb/>
            into disorder, and killing about eight hundred men. <lb/>
            U pon this, Hannibal determined to retrace his steps. <lb/>
            Perceiving the mistake which he had made, and the <lb/>
            danger he was in, he crucified his guides, but still could <lb/>
            not tell how to force his way out through the Roman <lb/>
            army which was in possession of the mountain passes. <lb/>
            While all were terrified and disheartened, believing them­ <lb/>
            selves to be beset on all sides by dangers from which <lb/>
            there was no escape, Hannibal decided on extricating <lb/>
            himself by stratagem. Taking about two thousand <lb/>
            captured oxen, he ordered his soldiers to bind a torch or <lb/>
            faggot of dry wood to their horns, and at night at a given <lb/>
            signal to set them on fire, and drive the animals towards <lb/>
            the narrow outlet near the enemy's camp. While this <lb/>
            was being done, he got the remainder of the troops under <lb/>
            arms and led them slowly forward. The cattle, while the <lb/>
            flame was moderate, and burned only the wood, walked <lb/>
            steadily forward towards the mountain side, astonishing <lb/>
            the shepherds on the mountain, who thought that it must <lb/>
            be an army, marching in one great column, carrying torches. <lb/>
            But when their horns were burned to the quick, causing <lb/>
            them considerable pain, the beasts, now scorched by the <lb/>
            tire from one another as they shook their heads, set off in <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            wild career over the mountains, with their foreheads and <lb/>
            tails blazing, setting fire to a great part of the wood <lb/>
            through which they passed. The Romans watching the <lb/>
            pass were terribly scared at the sight; for the flames <lb/>
            looked like torches carried by men running, and they <lb/>
            fell into great confusion and alarm, thinking that they <lb/>
            were surrounded, and about to be attacked on all sides by <lb/>
            the enemy. They dared not remain at their post, but <lb/>
            abandoned the pass, and made for the main body. At <lb/>
            that moment Hannibal's light troops took possession of <lb/>
            the heights commanding the outlet, and the main army <lb/>
            marched safely through, loaded with plunder.</p>
          <p>VII. It happened that while it was yet night Fabius <lb/>
            perceived the trick; for some of the oxen in their flight <lb/>
            had fallen into the hands of the Romans; but, fearing to <lb/>
            fall into an ambuscade in the darkness, he kept his men <lb/>
            quiet under arms. When day broke he pursued and <lb/>
            attacked the rearguard, which led to many confused skir­ <lb/>
            mishes in the rough ground, and produced great confusion, <lb/>
            till Hannibal sent back his practised Spanish mountaineers <lb/>
            from the head of his column. These men, being light <lb/>
            and active, attacked the heavily-armed Roman infantry <lb/>
            and beat off Fabius' attack with very considerable loss. <lb/>
            Now Fabius's unpopularity reached its highest pitch, and <lb/>
            he was regarded with scorn and contempt. He had, they <lb/>
            said, determined to refrain from a pitched battle, meaning <lb/>
            to overcome Hannibal by superior generalship, and he <lb/>
            had been defeated in that too. And Hannibal himself, <lb/>
            wishing to increase the dislike which the Romans felt for <lb/>
            him, though he burned and ravaged every other part of <lb/>
            Italy, forbade his men to touch Fabius's own estates, and <lb/>
            even placed a guard to see that no damage was done to <lb/>
            them. This was reported at Rome, greatly to his dis­ <lb/>
            credit ; and the tribunes of the people brought all kinds <lb/>
            of false accusations against him in public harangues, in­ <lb/>
            stigated chiefly by Metilius, who was not Fabius's personal <lb/>
            enemy, but being a relative of Minucius, the Master of <lb/>
            the Horso, thought that he was pressing the interests <lb/>
            of the latter by giving currency to all these scandalous <lb/>
            reports about Fabius. He was also disliked by the Senate <lb/>
            because of the terms which he had arranged with Han­ <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            nibal about the exchange of prisoners. The two com­ <lb/>
            manders agreed that the prisoners should be exchanged man <lb/>
            for man, and that if either party had more than the other, <lb/>
            he should redeem for two hundred and fifty drachmas per <lb/>
            man. When, then, this exchange took place, two hundred <lb/>
            and forty Romans were found remaining in Hannibal's <lb/>
            hands. The Senate determined not to send these men's <lb/>
            ransom, and blamed Fabius for having acted improperly <lb/>
            and against the interests of the State in taking back men <lb/>
            whose cowardice had made them fall into the hands of the <lb/>
            enemy. Fabius, on hearing this, was not moved at the <lb/>
            discontent of the citizens, but having no money, as he <lb/>
            could not bear to deceive Hannibal and give up his <lb/>
            countrymen, sent his son to Rome with orders to sell part <lb/>
            of his estate, and bring him the money at once to the <lb/>
            camp. The young man soon sold the land, and quickly <lb/>
            returned. Fabius now sent the ransom to Hannibal and <lb/>
            recovered the prisoners, many of whom afterwards offered <lb/>
            to repay him ; but he would take nothing, and forgave <lb/>
            their debt to them all.</p>
          <p>VIII. After this the priests recalled him to Rome to <lb/>
            perform certain sacrifices, He now transferred the com­ <lb/>
            mand to Minucius, and not merely ordered him as dictator <lb/>
            not to fight or entangle himself with the enemy, but even <lb/>
            gave him much advice and besought him not to do so, all <lb/>
            of which Minucius set at nought, and at once attacked <lb/>
            the enemy. Once he observed that Hannibal had sent <lb/>
            the greater part of his army out to forage for provisions, <lb/>
            and, attacking the remaining troops, he drove them into <lb/>
            their intrenched camp, slew many, and terrified the rest, <lb/>
            who feared that he might carry the camp by assault. <lb/>
            When Hannibal's forces collected again, Minucius effected <lb/>
            his retreat with safety, having excited both himself and <lb/>
            the army with his success, and filled them with a spirit of <lb/>
            reckless daring. Soon an inflated report of the action <lb/>
            reached Rome. Fabius, when he heard of it, said that <lb/>
            with Minucius he feared success more than failure; but <lb/>
            the populace were delighted, and joyfully collected in the <lb/>
            Forum, where Metilius the tribune ascended the rostra, <lb/>
            and made a speech glorifying Minucius, and accusing <lb/>
            Fabius not merely of remissness or cowardice, but of <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            actual treachery, accusing also the other leading men of the <lb/>
            city of having brought on the war from the very beginning <lb/>
            in order to destroy the constitution; and he also charged <lb/>
            them with having placed the city in the hands of one <lb/>
            man as dictator, who by his dilatory proceedings would <lb/>
            give Hannibal time to establish himself firmly and to <lb/>
            obtain reinforcements from Africa to enable him to conquer <lb/>
            Italy.</p>
          <p>IX. When Fabius addressed the people, he did not <lb/>
            deign to make any defence against the accusations of the <lb/>
            tribune, but said that he should accomplish his sacrifices <lb/>
            and sacred duties as quickly as possible, in order to return <lb/>
            to the army and punish Minucius for having fought a <lb/>
            battle against his orders. At this a great clamour was <lb/>
            raised by the people, who feared for their favourite Minu­ <lb/>
            cius. for a dictator has power to imprison any man, and <lb/>
            even to put him to death ; and they thought that Fabius, <lb/>
            a mild-tempered man now at last stirred up to wrath, <lb/>
            would be harsh and inexorable. All refrained from speak­ <lb/>
            ing, but Metilius, having nothing to fear because of the <lb/>
            privileges of his office of tribune (for that is the only <lb/>
            office which does not lose its prerogatives on the election <lb/>
            of a dictator, but remains untouched though all the rest <lb/>
            are annulled), made a violent appeal to the people, begging <lb/>
            them not to give up Minucius, nor allow him to be treated <lb/>
            as Manlius Torquatus treated his son, who had him be­ <lb/>
            headed, although he had fought most bravely and gained <lb/>
            a crown of laurel for his victory. He asked them to <lb/>
            remove Fabius from his dictatorship, and to bestow it upon <lb/>
            one who was able and willing to save the country. Excited <lb/>
            as they were by these words, they yet did not venture <lb/>
            upon removing Fabius from his post, in spite of their <lb/>
            feeling against him, but they decreed that Minucius <lb/>
            should conduct the war, having equal powers with the <lb/>
            dictator, a thing never before done in Rome, but which <lb/>
            occurred shortly afterwards. after the disaster at Cannæ, <lb/>
            when Marcus Junius was dictator in the camp, and, as <lb/>
            many members of the Senate had perished in the battle, <lb/>
            they chose another dictator, Fabius Buteo. However, he, <lb/>
            after enrolling the new senators, on the same day dis­ <lb/>
            missed his lictors, got rid of the crowd which escorted <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            him, and mixed with the people in the Forum, transacting <lb/>
            some business of his own as a private man.</p>
          <p>X. Now the people, by placing Minucius on the same <lb/>
            footing with the dictator, thought to humble Fabius, but <lb/>
            they formed a very false estimate of his character. He <lb/>
            did not reckon their ignorance to be his misfortune, but <lb/>
            as Diogenes the philosopher, when some one said " They <lb/>
            are deriding you," answered " But I am not derided," <lb/>
            thinking that those alone are derided who are affected <lb/>
            and disturbed by it, so Fabius quietly and unconcernedly <lb/>
            endured all that was done, hereby affording an example <lb/>
            of the truth of that philosophic maxim that a good and <lb/>
            honest man can suffer no disgrace. Yet he grieved over <lb/>
            the folly of the people on public grounds, because they <lb/>
            had given a man of reckless ambition an opportunity for <lb/>
            indulging his desire for battle; and, fearing that Minucius <lb/>
            would be altogether beside himself with pride and vain <lb/>
            glory, and would soon do some irreparable mischief, he <lb/>
            left Rome unperceived by any one. On reaching the <lb/>
            camp, he found Minucius no longer endurable, but in­ <lb/>
            solent and overbearing, and demanding to have the sole <lb/>
            command every other day. To this Fabius would not <lb/>
            agree, but divided his forces with him, thinking it better <lb/>
            to command a part than partly to command the whole of <lb/>
            the army. He took the first and fourth legion, and left <lb/>
            the second and third to Minucius, dividing the auxiliary <lb/>
            troops equally with him.</p>
          <p>As Minucius gave himself great airs, and was gratified <lb/>
            at the thought that the greatest officer in the State had <lb/>
            been humbled and brought low by his means, Fabius <lb/>
            reminded him that if he judged aright, he would regard <lb/>
            Hannibal, not Fabius, as his enemy; but that if he per­ <lb/>
            sisted in his rivalry with his colleagues, he must beware <lb/>
            lest he, the honoured victor, should appear more careless <lb/>
            of the safety and success of his countrymen, than he who <lb/>
            had been overcome and ill-treated by them.</p>
          <p>XI. Minucius thought all this to be merely the ex­ <lb/>
            pression of the old man's jealousy. He took his allotted <lb/>
            troops, and encamped apart from him. Hannibal was not <lb/>
            ignorant of what was passing, and watched all their <lb/>
            movements narrowly.</p><pb n="299"/>
            
          <p>There was a hill between the two armies, which it was <lb/>
            not difficult to take, which when taken would afford an army <lb/>
            a safe position, and one well supplied with necessaries. <lb/>
            The plain by which it was surrounded appeared to be <lb/>
            perfectly smooth, but was nevertheless intersected with <lb/>
            ditches and other hollow depressions. On this account <lb/>
            Hannibal would not take the hill, although he could <lb/>
            easily have done so, but preferred to leave it untouched, in <lb/>
            order to draw the enemy into fighting for its possession. <lb/>
            But as soon as he saw Fabius separated from Minucius, <lb/>
            he placed during the night some troops in the depressions <lb/>
            and hollows which we have mentioned, and at daybreak <lb/>
            sent a few men to take the hill, in order to draw Minucius <lb/>
            into fighting for it, in which he succeeded. Minucius <lb/>
            first sent out his light troops, then his cavalry, and finally, <lb/>
            seeing that Hannibal was reinforcing the troops on the <lb/>
            hill, he came down with his entire force. He fought <lb/>
            stoutly, and held his own against the soldiers on the hill, <lb/>
            who shot their missiles at him; when Hannibal, seeing <lb/>
            him thoroughly deceived, and offering an unprotected <lb/>
            flank to the troops in the ambush, gave them the signal <lb/>
            to charge. Upon this they attacked the Romans from all <lb/>
            sides, rushing upon them with loud shouts, cutting off the <lb/>
            rearmost men, and throwing the whole army into con­ <lb/>
            fusion and panic. Minucius himself lost heart and kept <lb/>
            glancing first at one and then at another of his officers, <lb/>
            none of whom ventured to stand their ground, but <lb/>
            betook themselves in a confused mass to running away, <lb/>
            a proceeding which brought them no safety, for the <lb/>
            Numidian horsemen, as the day was now theirs, scoured <lb/>
            the plain, encompassing the fugitives, and cut off all <lb/>
            stragglers.</p>
          <p>XII. Fabius had carefully watched the Romans, and <lb/>
            saw in what danger they were. Conscious, it would <lb/>
            seem, of what was going to happen, he had kept his <lb/>
            troops under arms, and gained his information of what <lb/>
            was going on, not from the reports of scouts, but from his <lb/>
            own eyesight, from a convenient height outside of his <lb/>
            camp. As soon as he saw the army surrounded and panic- <lb/>
            stricken, and heard the cries of the Romans, who no <lb/>
            longer fought, but were overcome by terror, and betaking <lb/>
            themselves to flight, he smote his thigh and with a deep <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            sigh, said to his friends, " By Hercules, now Minucius <lb/>
            has ruined himself, quicker than I expected, and yet <lb/>
            slower than his manoeuvres warranted." Having given <lb/>
            orders to carry out the standards as quickly as possible, <lb/>
            and for the whole army to follow, he said aloud, " My <lb/>
            men, hurry on your march : think of Marcus Minucius; he <lb/>
            is a brave man and loves his country. If he has made any <lb/>
            mistake in his haste to drive out the enemy, we will blame <lb/>
            him for that at another time." The appearance of Fabius <lb/>
            scared and drove back the Numidians, who were slaugh­ <lb/>
            tering the fugitives in the plain; next he bore against <lb/>
            those who were attacking the Roman rear, slaying all he <lb/>
            met, though most of them, before they were cut off and <lb/>
            treated as they had treated the Romans, betook themselves <lb/>
            to flight. Hannibal seeing that the fortune of the battle <lb/>
            was changed, and how Fabius himself, with a strength <lb/>
            beyond his years, was forcing his way through the thick­ <lb/>
            est battle up the hill to reach Minucius, withdrew his <lb/>
            troops, and, sounding a retreat, led them back into his en­ <lb/>
            trenched camp, affording a most seasonable relief to the <lb/>
            Romans. It is said that Hannibal as he retired, spoke <lb/>
            jokingly about Fabius to his friends in the words, “ Did I <lb/>
            not often warn you that the dark cloud which has so long <lb/>
            brooded on the mountain tops, would at last break upon <lb/>
            us with blasts of hail and storm ? "</p>
          <p>XIII. After the battle Fabius collected the spoils of <lb/>
            such of the enemy as were slain, and drew off his forces <lb/>
            without letting fall a single boastful or offensive expression <lb/>
            about his colleague. But Minucius assembled his own troops, <lb/>
            and thus addressed them, " My fellow-soldiers, it is beyond <lb/>
            human skill to make no mistakes in matters of importance, <lb/>
            but it is the part of a man of courage and sense to use <lb/>
            his mistakes as warnings for the future. I myself confess <lb/>
            that I have little fault to find with Fortune, and great <lb/>
            reason to thank her; for in the space of one day I have <lb/>
            learned what I never knew in all my previous life: that <lb/>
            is, that I am not able to command others, but myself <lb/>
            require a commander, and I have no ambition to conquer <lb/>
            a man by whom it is more glorious to be defeated. The <lb/>
            dictator is your leader in every thing except in this, that <lb/>
            I will lead you to express your thankfulness to him, by <lb/>
            being the first to offer myself to him as an example of <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            obedience and willingness to carry out his orders." After <lb/>
            these words he ordered the eagles to be raised aloft and <lb/>
            all the soldiers to follow them to the camp of Fabius. On <lb/>
            entering it, he proceeded to the General's tent, to the <lb/>
            surprise and wonderment of all. When Fabius was come <lb/>
            out, he placed his standards in the ground before him, <lb/>
            and himself addressed him as father in a loud voice, while <lb/>
            his soldiers greeted those of Fabius by the name of their <lb/>
            Patrons, which is the name by which freed men address <lb/>
            those who have set them free. Silence being enforced, <lb/>
            Minucius said: “ Dictator, you have won two victories to­ <lb/>
            day, for you have conquered Hannibal by your bravery, <lb/>
            and your colleague by your kindness and your generalship. <lb/>
            By the one you have saved our lives, and by the other <lb/>
            you have taught us our duty, for we have been disgrace­ <lb/>
            fully defeated by Hannibal, but beneficially and honour­ <lb/>
            ably by you. I call you my excellent father, having no <lb/>
            more honourable appellation to bestow, since I owe a <lb/>
            greater debt of gratitude to you than to him who begot <lb/>
            me. To him I merely owe my single life, but to you I <lb/>
            owe not only that but the lives of all my men." After <lb/>
            these words he embraced Fabius, and the soldiers followed <lb/>
            his example, embracing and kissing one another, so that <lb/>
            the camp was full of joy and of most blessed tears.</p>
          <p>XIV. After this, Fabius laid down his office, and consuls <lb/>
            were again elected. Those who were first elected followed <lb/>
            the defensive policy of Fabius, avoiding pitched battles <lb/>
            with Hannibal, but reinforcing the allies and preventing <lb/>
            defections. But when Terentius Varro was made consul, <lb/>
            a man of low birth, but notorious for his rash temper and <lb/>
            his popularity with the people, he made no secret, in his <lb/>
            inexperience and self-confidence, of his intention of risking <lb/>
            everything on one cast. He was always reiterating in <lb/>
            his public speeches that under such generals as Fal)ins <lb/>
            the war made no progress, whereas he would conquer the <lb/>
            enemy the first day he saw him. By means of these <lb/>
            boastful speeches he enrolled as soldiers such a multitude <lb/>
            as the Romans had never before had at their disposal in <lb/>
            any war, for there collected for the battle eighty-eight <lb/>
            thousand men. This caused great disquietude to Fabius <lb/>
            and other sensible Romans, who feared that if so many <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            of the youth of Rome were cut off, the city would never <lb/>
            recover from the blow. They addressed themselves there­ <lb/>
            fore to the other consul, Paulus Æmilius, a man of great <lb/>
            experience in war, but disagreeable to the people and <lb/>
            afraid of them because he had once been fined by them. <lb/>
            Fabius encouraged him to attempt to hold the other <lb/>
            consul's rashness in check, pointing out that he would <lb/>
            have to fight for his country's safety with Terentius <lb/>
            Varro no less than with Hannibal. Varro, he said, will <lb/>
            hasten to engage because he does not know his own <lb/>
            strength, and Hannibal will do so because he knows his <lb/>
            own weakness. " I myself, Paulus," said he, " am more &lt; <lb/>
            to be believed than Varro as to the condition of Hannibal's <lb/>
            affairs, and I am sure that if no battle takes place with <lb/>
            him for a year, he will either perish in this country or be <lb/>
            compelled to quit it; because even now, when he seems to <lb/>
            be victorious and carrying all before him, not one of his <lb/>
            enemies have come over to his side, while scarcely a third <lb/>
            of the force which he brought from home is now sur­ <lb/>
            viving." It is said that Paulus answered as follows: <lb/>
            " For my own part, Fabius, it is better for me to fall by <lb/>
            the spears of the enemy than be again condemned by the <lb/>
            votes of my own countrymen; but if public affairs are <lb/>
            indeed in this critical situation, I will endeavour rather <lb/>
            to approve myself a good general to you than to all those <lb/>
            who are urging me to the opposite course." With this <lb/>
            determination Paulus began the campaign.</p>
          <p>XV. Varro induced his colleague to adopt the system <lb/>
            of each consul holding the chief command on alternate <lb/>
            days.. He proceeded to encamp near Hannibal on the <lb/>
            banks of the river Aufidus, close to the village of Cannæ. <lb/>
            At daybreak he showed the signal of battle (a red tunic <lb/>
            displayed over the General's tent), so that the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians were at first disheartened at the daring of the <lb/>
            consul and the great number of his troops, more than <lb/>
            twice that of their own army. Hannibal ordered his <lb/>
            soldiers to get under arms, and himself rode with a few <lb/>
            others to a rising ground, from which he viewed the <lb/>
            enemy, who were already forming their ranks. When <lb/>
            one Gisco, a man of his own rank, said to him that the <lb/>
            numbers of the enemy were wonderful, Hannibal with a <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            serious air replied, " Another circumstance much more <lb/>
            wonderful than this has escaped your notice, Gisco.” <lb/>
            When Gisco asked what it might be, Hannibal answered, <lb/>
            “ It is, that among all those men before you there is not <lb/>
            one named Gisco." At this unexpected answer they all <lb/>
            began to laugh, and as they came down the hill they kept <lb/>
            telling this joke to all whom they met, so that the laugh <lb/>
            became universal, and Hannibal's staff was quite over­ <lb/>
            powered with merriment. The Carthaginian soldiers <lb/>
            seeing this took courage, thinking that their General <lb/>
            must be in a position to despise his enemy if he could <lb/>
            thus laugh and jest in the presence of danger.</p>
          <p>XVI. In the battle Hannibal employed several strata­ <lb/>
            gems: first, in securing the advantage of position, by <lb/>
            getting the wind at his back, for it blew a hurricane, <lb/>
            raising a harsh dust from the sandy plains, which rose <lb/>
            over the Carthaginians and blew in the faces of the <lb/>
            Romans, throwing them into confusion. Secondly, in his <lb/>
            disposition of his forces he showed great skill. The best <lb/>
            troops were placed on the wings, and the centre, which <lb/>
            was composed of the worst, was made to project far beyond <lb/>
            the rest of the line. The troops on each wing were told <lb/>
            that when the Romans had driven in this part of the line <lb/>
            and were so become partly enclosed, that each wing must <lb/>
            turn inwards, and attack them in the flank and rear and <lb/>
            endeavour to surround them. This was the cause of the <lb/>
            greatest slaughter; for when the centre gave way, and <lb/>
            made room for the pursuing Romans, Hannibal's line <lb/>
            assumed a crescent form, and the commanders of the <lb/>
            select battalions charging from the right and left of the <lb/>
            Romans attacked them in flank, destroying every man <lb/>
            except such as escaped being surrounded. It is related <lb/>
            that a similar disaster betel the Roman cavalry. The <lb/>
            horse of Paulus was wounded, and threw its rider, upon <lb/>
            which man after man of his staff dismounted and came to <lb/>
            help the consul on foot. The cavalry, seeing this, took it <lb/>
            for a general order to dismount, and at once attacked the <lb/>
            enemy on foot. Hannibal, seeing this, said, " I aID better <lb/>
            pleased at this than if he had handed them over to me <lb/>
            bound hand and foot." This anecdote is found in those <lb/>
            writers who have described the incidents of the battle in <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            detail. Of the consuls, Varro escaped with a few followers <lb/>
            to Venusia. Paulus, in the whirling eddies of the rout, <lb/>
            covered with darts which still stuck in his wounds, and <lb/>
            overwhelmed with sorrow at the defeat, sat down on a <lb/>
            stone to await his death at the hands of the enemy. The <lb/>
            blood with which his face and head were covered made it <lb/>
            hard for any one to recognise him; but even his own <lb/>
            friends and servants passed him by, taking no heed of <lb/>
            him. Only Cornelius Lentulus, a young patrician, saw <lb/>
            and recognised him. Dismounting from his horse and <lb/>
            leading it up to him he begged him to take it and pre­ <lb/>
            serve his life, at a time when the State especially needed <lb/>
            a wise ruler. But he refused, and forced the youth, in <lb/>
            spite of his tears, to remount his horse. He then took <lb/>
            him by the hand, saying, "Lentulus, tell Fabius <lb/>
            Maximus, and bear witness yourself, that Paulus jEmilius <lb/>
            followed his instructions to the last, and departed from <lb/>
            nothing of what was agreed upon between us; but he <lb/>
            was vanquished first by Varro, and secondly by Hannibal." <lb/>
            Having given Lentulus these instructions he sent him <lb/>
            away, and flinging himself on to the enemy's swords <lb/>
            perished. In that battle it is reckoned that fifty thousand <lb/>
            Romans fell, and four thousand were taken prisoners, <lb/>
            besides not less than ten thousand who were taken after <lb/>
            the battle in the camps of the two consuls.</p>
          <p>XVII. After this immense success, Hannibal was urged <lb/>
            by his friends to follow up his victory and enter Rome <lb/>
            with the fugitives, promising that five days thereafter <lb/>
            he should sup in the Capitol. It is not easy to say what <lb/>
            reasons could have deterred him from doing so, and it <lb/>
            seems rather as if some divinity prevented his march, and <lb/>
            inspired him with the dilatory and timid policy which he <lb/>
            followed. It is said that the Carthaginian, Barca, said to <lb/>
            him, “ You know how to win a victory, but do not know <lb/>
            how to use one." Yet so great a change was effected by <lb/>
            this victory that he, who before it had not possessed a <lb/>
            single city, market, or harbour in Italy, and had to obtain <lb/>
            his provisions with the utmost difficulty by plunder, <lb/>
            having no regular base of operations, but merely wander­ <lb/>
            ing about with his army as though carrying on brigand­ <lb/>
            age on a large scale, now saw nearly the whole of Italy at <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            his feet. Some of the largest and most powerful States <lb/>
            came over to him of their own accord, and he attacked <lb/>
            and took Capua, the most important city next to Rome <lb/>
            itself.</p>
          <p>It would appear that the saying of Euripides, that “ ad­ <lb/>
            versity tries our friends,” applies also to good generals. <lb/>
            That which before this battle was called Fabius's coward­ <lb/>
            ice and remissness, was now regarded as more than human <lb/>
            sagacity, and a foresight so wonderful as to be beyond <lb/>
            belief. Rome at once centred her last hopes upon Fabius, <lb/>
            taking refuge in his wisdom as men take sanctuary at an <lb/>
            altar, believing his discretion to be the chief cause of her <lb/>
            surviving this present crisis, even as in the old Gaulish <lb/>
            troubles. For though he had been so cautious and back­ <lb/>
            ward at a time when there seemed to be no imminent <lb/>
            danger, yet now when every one was giving way to use­ <lb/>
            less grief and lamentation, he alone walked through the <lb/>
            streets at a calm pace, with a composed countenance and <lb/>
            kindly voice, stopped all womanish wailings and assemblies <lb/>
            in public to lament their losses, persuaded the Senate to <lb/>
            meet, and gave fresh courage to the magistrates, being <lb/>
            really himself the moving spirit and strength of the State, <lb/>
            which looked to him alone to command it.</p>
          <p>XVIII. He placed guards at the gates to prevent the <lb/>
            mob from quitting the city, and regulated the period of <lb/>
            mourning, bidding every man mourn for thirty days in <lb/>
            his own house, after which all signs of mourning were to <lb/>
            be put away. As the feast of Ceres fell during those days, <lb/>
            it was thought better to omit both the sacrifices and the <lb/>
            processions than to have them marred by the conscious­ <lb/>
            ness of their misfortune, which would be painfully evident <lb/>
            in the small number of worshippers and their downcast <lb/>
            looks. However, everything that the soothsayers com­ <lb/>
            manded to appease the anger of the gods and to expiate <lb/>
            prodigies was carried out. Fabius Pictor, a relative of <lb/>
            the great Fabius, was sent to Delphi, and of two of the <lb/>
            Vestal virgins who were found to have been seduced, one <lb/>
            was buried alive, as is the usual custom, while the other <lb/>
            died by her own hand. Especially admirable was the <lb/>
            spirit and the calm composure of the city when the consul <lb/>
            Varro returned after his flight. He came humbled to <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            the dust, as a man would who had been the cause of a <lb/>
            terrible disaster, but at the gate the Senate and all the <lb/>
            people went out to greet him. The chief men and the <lb/>
            magistrates, amongst whom was Fabius, having obtained <lb/>
            silence, spoke in praise of him " because he had not des­ <lb/>
            paired of the State after such a calamity, but had come <lb/>
            back to undertake the conduct of affairs and do what he <lb/>
            could for his countrymen as one who thought they might <lb/>
            yet be saved."</p>
          <p>XIX. AY hen they learned that Hannibal after the battle <lb/>
            had turned away from Rome to other parts of Italy, the <lb/>
            Romans again took courage and sent out armies and <lb/>
            generals. Of these the most remarkable were Fabius <lb/>
            Maximus and Claudius Marcellus, both equally admirable, <lb/>
            but from an entirely different point of view. Marcellus, <lb/>
            as has been related in his Life, was a man of activity and <lb/>
            high spirit, rejoicing in a hand-to-hand fight, and just <lb/>
            like the lordly warriors of Homer. With a truly venture­ <lb/>
            some audacity, he in his first battles outdid in boldness <lb/>
            even the bold Hannibal himself; while Fabius, on the <lb/>
            other hand, was convinced that his former reasoning was <lb/>
            true, and believed that without any one fighting or even <lb/>
            meddling with Hannibal, his army would wear itself out <lb/>
            and consume away, just as the body of an athlete when <lb/>
            overstrained and exerted soon loses its fine condition. <lb/>
            For this reason Poseidonius calls Fabius the shield, and <lb/>
            Marcellus the sword of Rome, because the steadiness of <lb/>
            Fabius, combined with the warlike ardour of Marcellus, <lb/>
            proved the saving of the state. Hannibal, frequently <lb/>
            meeting Marcellus, who was like a raging torrent, had his <lb/>
            forces shaken and weakened; while Fabius, like a deep <lb/>
            quiet river kept constantly undermining them and wast­ <lb/>
            ing them away unperceived. - Hannibal was at length <lb/>
            reduced to such extremities that he was weary of fight­ <lb/>
            ing Marcellus, and feared Fabius even though he did not <lb/>
            fight: for these were the persons whom he generally had <lb/>
            to deal with, as prætors, consuls, or pro-consuls, for each <lb/>
            of them was five times consul. He drew Marcellus, when <lb/>
            consul for the fifth time, into an ambuscade; but although <lb/>
            he tried every art and stratagem upon Fabius he could <lb/>
            affect nothing, except once, when he very nearly succeeded <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            in mining him. He forged letters from the leading citi­ <lb/>
            zens of Metapontum, and then sent them to Fabius. These <lb/>
            letters were to the effect that the city would surrender if <lb/>
            he appeared before it, and that the conspirators were only <lb/>
            waiting for his approach. Fabius was so much moved by <lb/>
            these letters as to take a part of his army and commence <lb/>
            a night march thither; but meeting with unfavourable <lb/>
            omens on the way he turned back, and soon afterwards <lb/>
            learned that the letters were a stratagem of Hannibal's, <lb/>
            who was waiting for him under the city walls. This <lb/>
            escape one may attribute to the favour of Heaven.</p>
          <p>XX. In the case of revolts and insurrections among the <lb/>
            subject cities and allies, Fabius thought it best to restrain <lb/>
            them and discountenance their proceedings in a gentle <lb/>
            manner, not treating every suspected person with harsh­ <lb/>
            ness, or inquiring too strictly into every case of suspected <lb/>
            disloyalty. It is said that a Marsian soldier, one of the <lb/>
            chief men of the allies for bravery and nobility of birth, <lb/>
            was discovered by Fabius to be engaged in organizing a <lb/>
            revolt. Fabius showed no sign of anger, but admitted <lb/>
            that he had not been treated with the distinction he <lb/>
            deserved, and said that in the present instance he should <lb/>
            blame his officers for distributing rewards more by favour <lb/>
            than by merit; but that in future he should be vexed <lb/>
            with him if he did not apply directly to himself when he <lb/>
            had any request to make. Saying this, he presented him <lb/>
            with a war horse and other marks of honour, so that <lb/>
            thenceforth the man always served him with the utmost <lb/>
            zeal and fidelity. He thought it a shame that trainers of <lb/>
            horses and dogs should be able to tame the savage spirit <lb/>
            of those animals by careful attention and education rather <lb/>
            than by whips and clogs, and yet that a commander of <lb/>
            men should not rely chiefly on mild and conciliatory <lb/>
            measures, but treat them more harshly than gardeners <lb/>
            treat the wild fig-trees, wild pears, and wild olives, which <lb/>
            they by careful cultivation turn into trees bearing good <lb/>
            fruit. His captains informed him that a certain soldier, <lb/>
            a Lucanian by birth, was irregular and often absent from <lb/>
            his duty. He made inquiries as to what his general <lb/>
            conduct was. All agreed that it would be difficult to find <lb/>
            a better soldier, and related some of his exploits. Fabii, <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            at length discovered that the cause of his absence was that <lb/>
            he was in love with a certain girl, and that he continually <lb/>
            ran the risk of making long journeys from the camp to <lb/>
            meet her. Without the knowledge of the soldier, he sent <lb/>
            and apprehended this girl, whom he concealed in his own <lb/>
            tent. Then he invited the Lucanian to a private inter­ <lb/>
            view, and addressed him as follows:—“ You have been <lb/>
            observed frequently to pass the night outside of the camp, <lb/>
            contrary to the ancient practice and discipline of the <lb/>
            Roman army: but also, you have been observed to be a <lb/>
            brave man. Your crime is atoned for by your valiant <lb/>
            deeds, but for the future I shall commit you to the custody <lb/>
            of another person." Then, to the astonishment of the <lb/>
            soldier, he led the girl forward, joined their hands, and <lb/>
            said: “ This lady pledges her word that you will remain <lb/>
            in the camp with us. You must prove by your conduct <lb/>
            that it was not from any unworthy motive, for which she <lb/>
            was the pretext, but solely through love for her that you <lb/>
            used to desert your post." This is the story which is <lb/>
            related about him.</p>
          <p>XXI. Fabius obtained possession of Tarentum by <lb/>
            treachery in the following manner. In his army was <lb/>
            a young man of Tarentum whose sister was devotedly <lb/>
            attached to him. Her lover was a Bruttian, and one of <lb/>
            the officers of Hannibal's garrison there. This gave the <lb/>
            Tarentine hopes of effecting his purpose, and with the <lb/>
            consent of Fabius he went into the city, being commonly <lb/>
            supposed to have run away to see his sister. For the first <lb/>
            few days the Bruttian remained in his quarters, as she <lb/>
            wished her amour with him not to be known to her <lb/>
            brother. He then, however, said: " There was a rumour <lb/>
            in the army that you were intimate with one of the chiefs <lb/>
            of the garrison. Who is he ? for if he is as they say, a <lb/>
            tHan of courage and distinction—war, which throws every­ <lb/>
            thing into confusion, will care little what countryman he <lb/>
            may be. Nothing is disgraceful which we cannot avoid ; <lb/>
            but it is a blessing, at a time when justice has no power, <lb/>
            that we should yield to a not disagreeable necessity. Upon <lb/>
            this the lady sent for her Bruttian admirer and introduced <lb/>
            him to her brother. He, by encouraging the stranger in <lb/>
            his passion, and assuring him that he would induce his <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            sister to loot favourably on it, had no difficulty in inducing <lb/>
            the man, who was a mercenary soldier, to break his faith <lb/>
            in expectation of the great rewards which he was pro­ <lb/>
            mised by Fabius. This is the account given of the trans­ <lb/>
            action by most writers, though some say that the lady by <lb/>
            whose means the Bruttian was seduced from his allegiance <lb/>
            was not a Tarentine, but a Bruttian by race, who was on <lb/>
            intimate terms with Fabius ; and that as soon as she dis­ <lb/>
            covered that a fellow-countryman and acquaintance of <lb/>
            hers was in command of the Bruttian garrison, told Fabius <lb/>
            of it, and by interviews which she had with the officer <lb/>
            outside the walls gradually won him over to the Roman <lb/>
            interests.</p>
          <p>XXII. While these negotiations were in progress, <lb/>
            Fabius, wishing to contrive something to draw Hannibal <lb/>
            away, sent orders to the troops at Rhegium to ravage the <lb/>
            Bruttian country and take Caulonia by storm. The troops <lb/>
            at Rhegium were a body of eight thousand men, mostly <lb/>
            deserters: and the most worthless of those disgraced <lb/>
            soldiers whom Marcellus brought from Sicily, so that <lb/>
            their loss would not cause any sorrow or harm to Rome ; <lb/>
            while he hoped that by throwing them out as a bait to <lb/>
            Hannibal he might draw him away from Tarentum, as <lb/>
            indeed he did. Hannibal at once started with his army <lb/>
            to attack them, and meanwhile, on the sixth day after <lb/>
            Fabius arrived before Tarentum, the young man having <lb/>
            previously concerted measures with the Bruttian and his <lb/>
            sister, came to him by night and told him that all was <lb/>
            ready; knowing accurately and having well inspected the <lb/>
            place where the Bruttian would be ready to open the gate <lb/>
            and let in the besiegers. Fabius would not depend en­ <lb/>
            tirely upon the chance of treachery; but though he him­ <lb/>
            self went quietly to the appointed place, the rest of the <lb/>
            army attacked the town both by sea and land, with great <lb/>
            clamour and disturbance, until, when most of the Taren­ <lb/>
            tines had run to repel the assault, the Bruttian gave the <lb/>
            word to Fabius, and, mounting his scaling ladders, he <lb/>
            took the place. On this occasion Fabius seems to have <lb/>
            acted unworthily of his reputation, for he ordered the <lb/>
            chief Bruttian officers to be put to the sword, that it <lb/>
            might not be said that he gained the place by treachery. <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            However, he did not obtain this glory, and gained a <lb/>
            reputation for faithlessness and cruelty. Many of the <lb/>
            Tarentines were put to death, thirty thousand were sold <lb/>
            for slaves, and the city was sacked by the soldiers. <lb/>
            Three thousand talents were brought into the public <lb/>
            treasury.</p>
          <p>While everything else was being carried off, it is said <lb/>
            that the clerk who was taking the inventory asked <lb/>
            Fabius what his pleasure was with regard to the gods, <lb/>
            meaning the statues and pictures. “ Fabius replied, " Let <lb/>
            us leave the Tarentines their angry gods." However, he <lb/>
            took the statue of Hercules from Tarentum and placed it <lb/>
            in the Capitol, and near to it he placed a brazen statue of <lb/>
            himself on horseback, acting in this respect much worse <lb/>
            than Marcellus, or rather proving that Marcellus was a <lb/>
            man of extraordinary mildness and generosity of temper, <lb/>
            as is shown in his Life.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Hannibal is said to have been hastening to <lb/>
            relieve Tarentum, and to have been within five miles of it <lb/>
            when it was taken. He said aloud : “ So then, the Romans <lb/>
            also have a Hannibal; we have lost Tarentum just as we <lb/>
            gained it." Moreover in private he acknowledged to his <lb/>
            friends that he had long seen that it was very difficult, <lb/>
            and now thought it impossible for them to conquer Italy <lb/>
            under existing circumstances.</p>
          <p>Fabius enjoyed a second triumph for this success, which <lb/>
            was more glorious than his first. He had contended with <lb/>
            Hannibal and easily baffled all his attempts just as a good <lb/>
            wrestler disengages himself with ease from the clutches of <lb/>
            an antagonist whose strength is beginning to fail him; for <lb/>
            Hannibal's army was no longer what it had been, being <lb/>
            partly corrupted by luxury and plunder, and partly also <lb/>
            worn out by unremitting toils and battles.</p>
          <p>One Marcus Livius had been in command of Tarentum <lb/>
            when Hannibal obtained possession of it. In spite of this, <lb/>
            he held the citadel, from which he could not be dislodged, <lb/>
            until Tarentum was recaptured by the Romans. This <lb/>
            man was vexed at the honours paid to Fabius, and once, in <lb/>
            a transport of envy and vain glory, he said before the <lb/>
            Senate that he, not Fabius, was the real author of the <lb/>
            recapture of the town. Fabius with a smile answered: <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            “ Very true; for if you had not lost the place, I could <lb/>
            never have recaptured it."</p>
          <p>XXIV.The Romans, among many other marks of <lb/>
            respect for Fabius, elected his son consul. When he had <lb/>
            entered on this office and was making some arrangements <lb/>
            for the conduct of the war, his father, either because of <lb/>
            his age and infirmities or else intending to try his son, <lb/>
            mounted on horseback and rode towards him through the <lb/>
            crowd of bystanders. The young man seeing him at a <lb/>
            distance would not endure this slight, but sent a lictor to <lb/>
            bid his father dismount and come on foot, if he wanted <lb/>
            anything of the consul. Those present were vexed at this <lb/>
            order, and looked on Fabius in silence, as if they thought <lb/>
            that he was unworthily treated, considering his great <lb/>
            reputation : but he himself instantly alighted, ran to his <lb/>
            son, and embracing him, said : " You both think and act <lb/>
            rightly, my son; for you know whom you command, and <lb/>
            how great an office you hold. Thus it was that we and <lb/>
            our ancestors made Rome great, by thinking less of our <lb/>
            parents and of our children than of the glory of our <lb/>
            country." It is even said to be true that the great grand­ <lb/>
            father of Fabius, although he had been consul five times, <lb/>
            had finished several campaigns with splendid triumphs, <lb/>
            and was one of the most illustrious men in Rome, yet <lb/>
            acted as lieutenant to his son when consul in the field, and <lb/>
            that in the subsequent triumph the son drove into Rome <lb/>
            in a chariot and four, while he with the other officers <lb/>
            followed him on horseback, glorying in the fact that <lb/>
            although he was his son's master, and although he was <lb/>
            and was accounted the first citizen in Home, yet he sub­ <lb/>
            mitted himself to the laws and the chief magistrate. Nor <lb/>
            did he deserve admiration for this alone.</p>
          <p>Fabius had the misfortune to lose his son, and this he <lb/>
            bore with fortitude, as became a man of sense and an <lb/>
            excellent parent. He himself pronounced the funeral <lb/>
            oration which is always spoken by some relative on the <lb/>
            deaths of illustrious men, and afterwards he wrote a copy <lb/>
            of his speech and distributed it to his friends.</p>
          <p>XXV. Cornelius Scipio meanwhile had been sent to <lb/>
            Spain, where he had defeated the Carthaginians in many <lb/>
            battles and driven them out of the country, and had <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            also overcome many tribes, taken many cities, and done <lb/>
            glorious deeds for Rome. On his return he was received <lb/>
            with great honour and respect, and, feeling that the people <lb/>
            expected some extraordinary exploit from him, he decided <lb/>
            that it was too tame a proceeding to fight Hannibal in <lb/>
            Italy, and determined to pour troops into Africa, attack <lb/>
            . Carthage, and transfer the theatre of war from Italy to <lb/>
            that country. He bent all his energies to persuade <lb/>
            the people to approve of this project, but was violently <lb/>
            opposed by Fabius, who spread great alarm through the <lb/>
            city, pointing out that it was being exposed to great <lb/>
            danger by a reckless young man, and endeavouring by <lb/>
            every means in his power to prevent the Romans from <lb/>
            adopting Scipio's plan. He carried his point with the <lb/>
            Senate, but the people believed that he was envious of <lb/>
            Scipio's prosperity and desired to check him, because he <lb/>
            feared that if he did gain some signal success, and either <lb/>
            put an end to the war altogether or remove it from Italy, <lb/>
            he himself might be thought a feeble and dilatory <lb/>
            general for not having finished the war in so many <lb/>
            campaigns.</p>
          <p>It appears that at first Fabius opposed him on grounds <lb/>
            of prudence and caution, really fearing the dangers of his <lb/>
            project, but that the contest gradually became a personal <lb/>
            one, and he was moved by feelings of jealousy to hinder <lb/>
            the rise of Scipio ; for he tried to induce Crassus, Scipio's <lb/>
            colleague, not to give up the province of Africa to Scipio, <lb/>
            but if the expedition were determined on, to go thither <lb/>
            himself, and he prevented his being supplied with funds <lb/>
            for the campaign. Scipio being thus compelled to <lb/>
            raise funds himself, obtained them from the cities in <lb/>
            Etruria which were devoted to his interests. Crassus <lb/>
            likewise was not inclined to quarrel with him, and was <lb/>
            also obliged to remain in Italy by his office of Pontifex <lb/>
            Maximus.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Fabius now tried another method to oppose <lb/>
            Scipio. He dissuaded the youth of the city from taking <lb/>
            service with him by continually vociferating in all public <lb/>
            meetings that Scipio not only was himself running away <lb/>
            from Hannibal, but also was about to take all the remain­ <lb/>
            ing forces of Italy out of the country with hill, deluding <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            the young men with vain hopes, and so persuading them <lb/>
            to leave their parents and wives, and their city too, while <lb/>
            a victorious and invincible enemy was at its very gates. <lb/>
            By these representations he alarmed the Romans, who <lb/>
            decreed that Scipio should only use the troops in Sicily, <lb/>
            and three hundred of the best men of his Spanish army. <lb/>
            In this transaction Fabius seems to have acted according <lb/>
            to the dictates of his own cautious disposition.</p>
          <p>However, when Scipio crossed over into Africa, news <lb/>
            came to Rome at once of great and glorious exploits per­ <lb/>
            formed and great battles won. As substantial proof of <lb/>
            these there came many trophies of war, and the king of <lb/>
            Numidia as a captive. Two camps were burned and <lb/>
            destroyed, with great slaughter of men, and loss of horses <lb/>
            and war material in the flames. Embassies also were <lb/>
            sent to Hannibal from Carthage, begging him in piteous <lb/>
            terms to abandon his fruitless hopes in Italy and come <lb/>
            home to help them, while in Rome the name of Scipio was <lb/>
            in every man's mouth because of his successes. At this <lb/>
            period Fabius proposed that a successor to Scipio should <lb/>
            be sent out, without having any reason to allege for it <lb/>
            except the old proverb that it is dangerous to entrust such <lb/>
            important operations to the luck of one man, because it is <lb/>
            hard for the same man always to be lucky. This proposal <lb/>
            of his offended most of his countrymen, who thought him <lb/>
            a peevish and malignant old man, or else that he was timid <lb/>
            and spiritless from old age, and excessively terrified at <lb/>
            Hannibal; for, even when Hannibal quitted Italy and <lb/>
            withdrew his forces Fabius, would not permit the joy of <lb/>
            his countrymen to be unmixed with alarm, as he informed <lb/>
            them that now the fortunes of Rome were in a more <lb/>
            critical situation than ever, because Hannibal would be <lb/>
            much more to be dreaded in Africa under the walls of <lb/>
            Carthage itself, where he would lead an army, yet reeking <lb/>
            with the blood of many Roman dictators, consuls and <lb/>
            generals, to attack Scipio. By these words the city was <lb/>
            again filled with terror, and although the war had been <lb/>
            removed to Africa yet its alarms seemed to have come <lb/>
            nearer to Rome.</p>
          <p>XXVII. However Scipio, after no long time, defeated <lb/>
            Hannibal in a pitched battle and crushed the pride of <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            Carthage under foot. He gave the Romans the enjoyment <lb/>
            of a success beyond their hopes, and truly <lb/>
            “ Restored the city, shaken by the storm."</p>
          <p>Fabius Maximus did not survive till the end of the war, <lb/>
            nor did he live to hear of Hannibal's defeat, or see the <lb/>
            glorious and lasting prosperity of his country, for about <lb/>
            the time when Hannibal left Italy he fell sick and died.</p>
          <p>The Thebans, we are told, buried Epameinondas at the <lb/>
            public expense, because he died so poor that they say no­ <lb/>
            thing was found in his house except an iron spit. Fabius <lb/>
            was not honoured by the Romans with a funeral at the <lb/>
            public expense, yet every citizen contributed the smallest <lb/>
            Roman coin towards the expenses, not that he needed the <lb/>
            money, but because they buried him as the father of the <lb/>
            people, so that in his death he received the honourable <lb/>
            respect which he had deserved in his life.</p>

            <title type="main">COMPARISON OF PERIKLES AND FABIUS MAXIMUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. SUCH is the story of these men's lives. As they both <lb/>
            gave many proofs of ability in war and politics, let us <lb/>
            first turn our attention to their warlike exploits. And <lb/>
            here we must notice that Perikles found the Athenian <lb/>
            people at the height of their power and prosperity, so <lb/>
            that from the flourishing condition of the State it could <lb/>
            scarcely meet with any great disaster, whereas Fabius per­ <lb/>
            formed his great services to Rome when it was in the last <lb/>
            extremity of danger, and did not merely, like Perikles, <lb/>
            confirm the prosperity of his country, but greatly improved <lb/>
            it, having found it in a lamentable condition. Moreover, <lb/>
            the successes of Kimon, the victories of Myronides and Leo­ <lb/>
            krates, and the many achievements of Tolmides rather <lb/>
            gave Perikles when in chief command an occasion for pub­ <lb/>
            lic rejoicing and festivity, than any opportunity for either <lb/>
            conquests abroad or defensive wars at home. Fabius, <lb/>
            on the other hand, had before his eyes the spectacle of <lb/>
            many defeats and routs of Roman armies, of many consuls <lb/>
            and generals fallen in battle, of lakes, plains and forests <lb/>
            filled with the bodies of the slain, and of rivers running <lb/>
            with blood. Yet with his mature and unbending intellect <lb/>
            he undertook to extricate Rome from these dangers, and. <lb/>
            as it were by his own strength alone supported the State, <lb/>
            so that it was not utterly overwhelmed by these terrible <lb/>
            disasters. N evertheless it would appear not to be so hard a <lb/>
            task to manage a State in adversity, when it is humble and <lb/>
            is compelled by its misfortunes to obey wise counsellors, <lb/>
            as it is to check and bridle a people excited and arrogant <lb/>
            with good fortune, which was especially the case with Peri­ <lb/>
            kles and the Athenians. On the other hand, considering <lb/>
            the terrible nature of the blows which had fallen on the <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            Romans, Fabius must have been a great and strong-minded <lb/>
            man not to be disconcerted by them, but still to be able to <lb/>
            carry out the policy upon which he had determined.</p>
          <p>II. We may set the capture of Samos by Perikles against <lb/>
            the retaking of Tarentum by Fabius, and also the conquest <lb/>
            of Euboea by the one against that of the Campanian cities <lb/>
            by the other, though Capua itself was recovered by the <lb/>
            consuls, Fulvius and Appius. Fabius seems never to have <lb/>
            fought a pitched battle, except that one which gained him <lb/>
            his first triumph, while Perikles set up nine trophies for <lb/>
            victories by sea and land. But again, there is no action of <lb/>
            Perikles which can be compared to that of Fabius when <lb/>
            he snatched away Minucius from the grasp of Hannibal, <lb/>
            and saved an entire Roman army from destruction. That <lb/>
            was an exploit glorious for the courage, generalship, and <lb/>
            kindness of heart displayed by Fabius; but, on the <lb/>
            other hand Perikles, made no such blunder as did Fabius, <lb/>
            when out-generalled by Hannibal with the cattle. Here, <lb/>
            although . Fabius caught his enemy in a defile which he <lb/>
            had entered by chance, yet he let him escape by night, <lb/>
            and next day found his tardy movements outstripped, and <lb/>
            himself defeated by the man whom he had just before so <lb/>
            completely cut off. If it be the part of a good general, not <lb/>
            merely to deal with the present, but to make conjectures <lb/>
            about the future, we may remark that the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            war ended just as Perikles had foretold, for the Athenians <lb/>
            frittered away their strength; whereas the Romans, con­ <lb/>
            trary to the expectation of Fabius, by sending Scipio to <lb/>
            attack Carthage gained a complete victory, not by chance, <lb/>
            but by the skill of their general and the courage of their <lb/>
            troops, who overthrew the enemy in a pitched battle. <lb/>
            Thus the one was proved to be right by the misfortunes <lb/>
            of his country, and the other proved to be wrong by its <lb/>
            success, indeed it is just as much a fault in a general to <lb/>
            receive a check from want of foresight as to let slip an <lb/>
            opportunity through diffidence: and both these failings, <lb/>
            excess of confidence and want of confidence, are common <lb/>
            to all except the most consummate generals. Thus much <lb/>
            for their military talents.</p>
          <p>III. In political matters, the Peloponnesian war is a <lb/>
            great blot upon the fame of Perikles; for it is said to have <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            been caused by his refusal to yield the least point to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. I do not imagine, however, that Fabius <lb/>
            Maximus would have yielded anything to the Carthagi­ <lb/>
            nians, but would have bravely risked any danger in <lb/>
            defence of the Roman Empire. The kind treatment of <lb/>
            Minucius by Fabius and his mildness of character con­ <lb/>
            trast very favourably with the bitter party feud of Peri­ <lb/>
            kles with Kimon and Thucydides, who were men of good <lb/>
            birth, and belonging to the conservative party, and <lb/>
            whom Perikles drove into exile by the ostracism. Then, <lb/>
            too, the power of Perikles was much greater than that of <lb/>
            Fabius. Perikles would not permit the State to suffer <lb/>
            disaster because of the bad management of her generals. <lb/>
            One of them alone, Tolmides, succeeded in having his own <lb/>
            way, against the wishes of Perikles, and perished in an <lb/>
            attack on the Bœotians, while all the rest, because of his <lb/>
            immense influence and power, submitted themselves to his <lb/>
            authority and regulated their proceedings by his ideas. <lb/>
            Whereas Fabius, although he could avoid any error in <lb/>
            managing his own army, was thwarted by his being <lb/>
            powerless to control the movements of other generals.</p>
          <p>For the Romans would not have suffered so many <lb/>
            defeats if Fabius had enjoyed the same power that <lb/>
            Perikles did in Athens. As to their generosity with re­ <lb/>
            gard to money, the one was remarkable for never receiving <lb/>
            bribes, while the other spent much on ransoming prisoners <lb/>
            at his own expense; although this was not much above <lb/>
            six talents, while it is hard for any one to tell the amount <lb/>
            of money which Perikles might have taken from foreign <lb/>
            princes and Greek allied states, all of which he refused <lb/>
            and kept his hands clean. As to the great public works, <lb/>
            the construction of the temples, and of the public <lb/>
            buildings with which Perikles adorned Athens, the whole <lb/>
            of the edifices in Rome together, before the time of the <lb/>
            emperors, are not worthy to be compared to them, for they <lb/>
            far surpassed them both in largeness of scale and in <lb/>
            beauty of design.</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF ALKIBIADES.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. THE pedigree of Alkibiades is said to begin with <lb/>
            Eurysakes the son of Ajax, while on the mother's side <lb/>
            he descended from Alkmæon, being the son of Deino­ <lb/>
            mache, the daughter of Megakles. His father Kleinias <lb/>
            fought bravely at Artemisium in a trireme fitted out <lb/>
            at his own expense, and subsequently fell fighting <lb/>
            the Bœotians, in the battle of Koronea. Alkibiades <lb/>
            after this was entrusted to Perikles and Ariphron, the <lb/>
            two sons of Xanthippus, who acted as his guardians <lb/>
            because they were the next of kin. It has been well <lb/>
            remarked that the friendship of Sokrates for him did <lb/>
            not a little to increase his fame, seeing that Nikias, <lb/>
            Demosthenes, Lamakus, I hormio, Thrasybulus, and The­ <lb/>
            ramenes, were all men of mark in his lifetime, and yet <lb/>
            we do not know the name of the mother of any one <lb/>
            of them, while we know the name even of the nurse of <lb/>
            Alkibiades, who was a I aconian, named Amykla, and <lb/>
            that of Zopyrus, his pædagogus, one of which pieces of <lb/>
            information we owe to Antisthenes, and the other to <lb/>
            Plato. As to the beauty of Alkibiades, it is not necessary <lb/>
            to say anything except that it was equally fascinating <lb/>
            when he was a boy, a youth, and a man. The saying <lb/>
            of Euripides, that all beauties have a beautiful autumn <lb/>
            of their charms, is not universally true, but it was so in <lb/>
            the case of Alkibiades and of a few other persons because <lb/>
            of the symmetry and vigour of their frames. Even his lisp <lb/>
            is said to have added a charm to his speech, and to have <lb/>
            made his talk more persuasive. His lisp is mentioned by <lb/>
            Aristophanes in the verses in which he satirises Theorus, <lb/>
            in which Alkibiades calls him Theolus, for he pronounced <lb/>
            the letter r like 1. Archippus also gives a sneering <lb/>
            account of the son of Alkibiades, who, he said, swaggered <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            In his walk, trailing his cloak, that he might look as like <lb/>
            his father as possible, and <lb/>
            “ Bends his affected neck, and lisping speaks."</p>
          <p>II. His character, in the course of his varied and <lb/>
            brilliant career, developed many strange inconsistencies <lb/>
            and contradictions. Emulation and love of distinction <lb/>
            were the most prominent of his many violent passions, as <lb/>
            is clear from the anecdotes of his childhood. Once when <lb/>
            hard pressed in wrestling, rather than fall, he began to <lb/>
            bite his opponent's hands. The other let go his hold, <lb/>
            and said, " You bite, Alkibiades, like a woman." “No,” <lb/>
            said he, " like a lion." While yet a child, he was playing <lb/>
            at knucklebones with other boys in a narrow street, and <lb/>
            when his turn came to throw, a loaded waggon was <lb/>
            passing. He at first ordered the driver to stop his team <lb/>
            because his throw was to take place directly in the path <lb/>
            of the waggon. Then as the boor who was driving <lb/>
            would not stop, the other children made way; but <lb/>
            Alkibiades flung himself down on his face directly in <lb/>
            front of the horses, and bade him drive on at his peril. <lb/>
            The man, in alarm, now stopped his horses, and the <lb/>
            others were terrified and ran up to him.</p>
          <p>In learning he was fairly obedient to all his teachers, <lb/>
            except in playing the flute, which he refused to do, de­ <lb/>
            claring that it was unfit for a gentleman. He said that <lb/>
            playing on the harp or lyre did not disfigure the face, <lb/>
            but that when a man was blowing at a flute, his own <lb/>
            friends could scarcely recognise him. Besides, the lyre <lb/>
            accompanies the voice of the performer, while the flute <lb/>
            takes all the breath of the player and prevents him even <lb/>
            from speaking. " Let the children of the Thebans," he <lb/>
            used to say, " learn to play the flute, for they know not <lb/>
            how to speak ; but we Athenians according to tradition <lb/>
            have the goddess Athene (Minerva) for our patroness, <lb/>
            and Apollo for our tutelary divinity; and of these the <lb/>
            first threw away the flute in disgust, and the other <lb/>
            actually flayed the flute player Marsyas." With such <lb/>
            talk as this, between jest and earnest, Alkibiades gave up <lb/>
            flute-playing himself, and induced his friends to do so, <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            for all the youth of Athens soon heard and approved of <lb/>
            Alkibiades's derision of the flute and those who learned it. <lb/>
            In consequence of this the flute went entirely out of <lb/>
            fashion, and was regarded with contempt.</p>
          <p>III. In Antiphon's scandalous chronicle, we read that <lb/>
            Alkibiades once ran away from home to the house of one <lb/>
            of his admirers.</p>
          <p>Ariphron, his other guardian, proposed to have him <lb/>
            cried; but Perikles forbade it, saying that, if he was dead, <lb/>
            he would only be found one day sooner because of it, <lb/>
            while if he was safe, he would be disgraced for life. <lb/>
            Antiphon also tells us that he killed one of his servants <lb/>
            by striking him with a club, at the gymnasium of <lb/>
            Sibyrtus. But perhaps we ought not to believe these <lb/>
            stories, which were written by an enemy with the <lb/>
            avowed purpose of defaming his character.</p>
          <p>IV. His youthful beauty soon caused him to be sur­ <lb/>
            rounded with noble admirers, but the regard of Sokrates <lb/>
            for him is a great proof of his natural goodness of dis­ <lb/>
            position, which that philosopher could discern in him, <lb/>
            but which he feared would wither away like a faded <lb/>
            flower before the temptations of wealth and position, and <lb/>
            the mass of sycophants by whom he was soon beset. <lb/>
            For no one ever was so enclosed and enveloped in the <lb/>
            good things of this life as Alkibiades, so that no breath of <lb/>
            criticism or free speech could ever reach him. Yet, with <lb/>
            all these flatterers about him, trying to prevent his ever <lb/>
            hearing a word of wholesome advice or reproof, he was <lb/>
            led by his own goodness of heart to pay special attention <lb/>
            to Sokrates, to whom he attached himself in preference to <lb/>
            all his rich and fashionable admirers.</p>
          <p>He soon became intimate with Sokrates, and when he <lb/>
            discovered that this man did not wish to caress and <lb/>
            admire him, but to expose his ignorance, search out his <lb/>
            faults, and bring down his vain unreasoning conceit, he <lb/>
            then <lb/>
            “ Let fall his feathers like a craven cook." <lb/>
            He considered that the conversation of Sokrates was <lb/>
            really a divine instrument for the discipline and education <lb/>
            of youth; and thus learning to despise himself, and to <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            admire his friend, charmed with his good nature, and full <lb/>
            of reverence for his virtues, he became insensibly in love <lb/>
            with him, though not as the world loveth ; so that all <lb/>
            men were astonished to see him dining with Sokrates, <lb/>
            wrestling with him, and sharing his tent, while he treated <lb/>
            all his other admirers with harshness and some even with <lb/>
            insolence, as in the case of Anytus the son of Anthemion. <lb/>
            This man, who was an admirer of Alkibiades, was en­ <lb/>
            tertaining a party of friends, and asked him to come. <lb/>
            Alkibiades refused the invitation, but got drunk that <lb/>
            night at a riotous party at his own house, in which state <lb/>
            he proceeded in a disorderly procession to Anytus. Here <lb/>
            he looked into the room where the guests were, and seeing <lb/>
            the tables covered with gold and silver drinking-cups, <lb/>
            ordered his slaves to carry away half of them, and then, <lb/>
            without deigning to enter the room, went home again. <lb/>
            Anytus' guests were vexed at this, and complained of his <lb/>
            being so arrogantly and outrageously treated. " Say <lb/>
            rather, considerately," answered Anytus, “ for although he <lb/>
            might have taken them all, yet he has left us the half of <lb/>
            them."</p>
          <p>V. In this same way he used to treat his other admirers, <lb/>
            with the exception, it is said, of one of the resident <lb/>
            aliens,. a man of small means who sold all that he had <lb/>
            and carried the money, amounting to about a hundred <lb/>
            staters, to Alkibiades, begging him to accept it. Alkibiades <lb/>
            laughed at him, and invited him to dinner. After <lb/>
            dinner he gave him back his money, and ordered him <lb/>
            next day to go and overbid those who were about to <lb/>
            bid for the office of farmer of the taxes. The poor man <lb/>
            begged to be excused, because the price was several <lb/>
            talents, but Alkibiades threatened to have him beaten if <lb/>
            he did not do so, for he had some private grudge of his <lb/>
            own against the farmers of the taxes. Accordingly the <lb/>
            alien went next morning early into the market-place and <lb/>
            bid a talent. The tax farmers now clustered round him <lb/>
            angrily, bidding him name some one as security, imagining <lb/>
            that he would not be able to find one. The poor man <lb/>
            was now in great trouble and was about to steal away, <lb/>
            when Alkibiades, who was at some distance, called out to <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετοικμόν</foreign>. </note> <note type="footnote"> II </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            the presiding magistrates, " Write down my name. I <lb/>
            am his friend, and I will be surety for him." On hearing <lb/>
            this, the tax farmers were greatly embarrassed, for their <lb/>
            habit was to pay the rent of each year with the proceeds <lb/>
            of the next, and they saw no way of doing so in this <lb/>
            instance. Consequently they begged the man to desist <lb/>
            from bidding, and offered him money. Alkibiades would <lb/>
            not permit him to take less than a talent, and when this <lb/>
            was given him he let him go. This was the way in <lb/>
            which he did him a kindness.</p>
          <p>VI. The love of Sokrates, though he had many rivals, <lb/>
            yet overpowered them all, for his words touched the <lb/>
            heart of Alkibiades and moved him to tears. Sometimes <lb/>
            his flatterers would bribe him by the offer of some pleasure, <lb/>
            to which he would yield and slip away from Sokrates, <lb/>
            but he was then pursued like a fugitive slave by the <lb/>
            latter, of whom he stood in awe, though he treated every <lb/>
            one else with insolence and contempt. Kleanthes used to <lb/>
            say that Sokrates's only hold upon him was through his <lb/>
            ears, while he scorned to meddle with the rest of his body. <lb/>
            And indeed Alkibiades was very prone to pleasure, as one <lb/>
            would gather from what Thucydides says on the subject. <lb/>
            Those too who played on his vanity and love of distinction <lb/>
            induced him to embark on vast projects before he was <lb/>
            ripe for them, assuring him that as soon as he began to <lb/>
            take a leading part in politics, he would not only eclipse <lb/>
            all the rest of the generals and orators, but would even <lb/>
            surpass Perikles in power and renown. But just as iron <lb/>
            which has been softened in the fire is again hardened by <lb/>
            cold, and under its influence contracts its expanded <lb/>
            particles, so did Sokrates, when he found Alkibiades <lb/>
            puffed up by vain and empty conceit, bring him down <lb/>
            to his proper level by his conversation, rendering <lb/>
            him humble minded by pointing out to him his many <lb/>
            deficiencies.</p>
          <p>VII. After he had finished his education, he went into <lb/>
            a school, and asked the master for a volume of Homer. <lb/>
            When the master said that he possessed none of Homer's <lb/>
            writings, he struck him with his fist, and left him. <lb/>
            Another schoolmaster told him that he had a copy of <lb/>
            Homer corrected by himself. " Do you," asked he, " you <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            who are able to correct Homer, teach boys to read! One <lb/>
            would think that you could instruct men."</p>
          <p>One day he wished to speak to Perikles, and came to <lb/>
            his house. Hearing that he was not at leisure, but was <lb/>
            engaged in considering how he was to give in his accounts <lb/>
            to the Athenians, Alkibiades, as he went away, said, “ It <lb/>
            would be better if he considered how to avoid giving in <lb/>
            any accounts at all to the Athenians."</p>
          <p>While yet a lad he served in the campaign of Potidæa, <lb/>
            where he shared the tent of Sokrates, and took his place <lb/>
            next him in the ranks. In an obstinate engagement they <lb/>
            both showed great courage, and when Alkibiades was <lb/>
            wounded and fell to the ground, Sokrates stood in front <lb/>
            of him, defending him, and so saved his life and arms <lb/>
            from the enemy. Properly, therefore, the prize for valour <lb/>
            belonged to Sokrates; but when the generals appeared <lb/>
            anxious to bestow it upon Alkibiades because of his <lb/>
            great reputation, Sokrates, who wished to encourage his <lb/>
            love for glory, was the first to give his testimony in his <lb/>
            favour, and to call upon them to crown him as victor and <lb/>
            to give him the suit of armour which was the prize. And <lb/>
            also at the battle of Delium, when the Athenians were <lb/>
            routed, Alkibiades, who was on horseback, when he <lb/>
            saw Sokrates retreating on foot with a few others, would <lb/>
            not ride on, but stayed by him and defended him, though <lb/>
            the enemy were pressing them and cutting off many <lb/>
            of them. These things, however, happened afterwards.</p>
          <p>VIII. He once struck Hipponikus, the father of <lb/>
            Kallias, a man of great wealth and noble birth, a blow <lb/>
            with his fist, not being moved to it by anger, or any <lb/>
            dispute, but having agreed previously with his friends to <lb/>
            do so for a joke. When every one in the city cried out <lb/>
            at his indecent and arrogant conduct, Alkibiades next <lb/>
            morning at daybreak came to the house of Hipponikus, <lb/>
            knocked, and came to him. Here he threw off his cloak, <lb/>
            and offered him his body, bidding him.flog him and punish <lb/>
            him for what he had done. Hipponikus, however, pardoned <lb/>
            him, and they became friends, so much so that Hipponikus <lb/>
            chose him for the husband of his daughter Hipparete. <lb/>
            Some writers say that not Hipponikus but Kallias his <lb/>
            son gave Hipparete to Alkibiades to wife, with a dowry <note type="footnote"> y 3 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            of ten talents, and that when her first child was born <lb/>
            Alkibiades demanded and received ten more talents, as if <lb/>
            he had made a previous agreement to that effect. Upon <lb/>
            this Kallias, fearing that Alkibiades might plot against <lb/>
            his life, gave public notice in the assembly that if he <lb/>
            died childless, he would leave his house and all his <lb/>
            property to the State.</p>
          <p>Hipparete was a quiet and loving wife, but was so <lb/>
            constantly insulted by her husband's amours with foreign <lb/>
            and Athenian courtesans, that she at length left his house <lb/>
            and went to her brother's. Alkibiades took no heed of <lb/>
            this, but continued in his debauchery.</p>
          <p>It was necessary for her to deliver her petition for <lb/>
            separation to the magistrate with her own hand, and <lb/>
            when she came to do so, Alkibiades laid hold of her, and <lb/>
            took her home with him through the market-place, no one <lb/>
            daring to oppose him and take her from him. She lived <lb/>
            with him until her death, which took place not long <lb/>
            after Alkibiades sailed for Ephesus. In this instance his <lb/>
            violence does not seem to have been altogether lawless or <lb/>
            without excuse, for the object of the law in making a <lb/>
            wife appear in person in public seems to be that she may <lb/>
            have an opportunity of meeting her husband and making <lb/>
            up her quarrel with him.</p>
          <p>IX. He had a dog of remarkable size and beauty, for <lb/>
            which he had paid seventy minæ. It had a very fine tail, <lb/>
            which he cut off. When his friends blamed him, and said <lb/>
            that every one was sorry for the dog and angry with him <lb/>
            for what he had done, he laughed and said, " Then I <lb/>
            have succeeded ; for I wish the Athenians to gossip about <lb/>
            this, for fear they should say something worse about me."</p>
          <p>X. It is said that his first public act was on the occasion <lb/>
            of a voluntary subscription for the State. He did not <lb/>
            intend doing anything of the sort, but as he was passing <lb/>
            he heard a great noise, and finding that voluntary sub­ <lb/>
            scriptions were being made, went and subscribed. The <lb/>
            people cheered and applauded him, at which he was so <lb/>
            much delighted as to forget a quail which he had in his <lb/>
            cloak. When it escaped and ran about bewildered, the <lb/>
            Athenians applauded all the more, and many rose and <lb/>
            chased it. It was caught by the pilot Antiochus, who <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            restored it, and became one of Alkibiades's greatest friends. <lb/>
            Starting with great advantages from his noble birth, his <lb/>
            wealth, his recognised bravery in battle, and his many <lb/>
            friends and relatives, he relied upon nothing so much as <lb/>
            on his eloquence for making himself popular and influ­ <lb/>
            ential. His rhetorical powers are borne witness to by the <lb/>
            comic dramatists; and the greatest of orators, Demosthenes, <lb/>
            in his speech against Meidias, speaks of Alkibiades as being <lb/>
            most eloquent, besides his other charms. If we are to <lb/>
            believe Theophrastus, who has inquired more diligently <lb/>
            into these various tales than any one else, Alkibiades <lb/>
            excelled all men of his time in readiness of invention and <lb/>
            resource. However, as he wished not merely to speak to <lb/>
            the purpose, but also to clothe his thoughts in the most <lb/>
            appropriate language, he did not always succeed in com­ <lb/>
            bining the two, and often hesitated and stopped, seeking <lb/>
            for the right word, and not continuing his speech until it <lb/>
            occurred to him.</p>
          <p>XI. He was renowned for his stud, and for the number <lb/>
            of his racing chariots. No other person, king or commoner, <lb/>
            ever entered seven four-horse chariots for the race at <lb/>
            Olympia except Alkibiades. His winning the first, second, <lb/>
            and fourth prizes with these, as Thucydides tells us, <lb/>
            though Euripides says that he won the third also, excels <lb/>
            in glory any other successes by other persons in these <lb/>
            races. The poem of Euripides runs as follows: <lb/>
            " Son of Kleinias, thee I sing, <lb/>
            In truth it is a noble thing, <lb/>
            First, second, and third place <lb/>
            To win in chariot race, <lb/>
            To hear the herald thrice thy name proclaim, <lb/>
            And thrice to bear away the olive crown of fame."</p>
          <p>XII. His success was rendered all the more conspicuous <lb/>
            by the manner in which the various States vied with one <lb/>
            another in showing him honour. Ephesus pitched a <lb/>
            magnificent tent for his accommodation, Chios furnished <lb/>
            his horses with provender, and himself with animals for <lb/>
            sacrifice ; and Lesbos supplied him with wine, and every <lb/>
            thing else necessary for giving great entertainments. <lb/>
            Yet even at this brilliant period of his life he incurred <lb/>
            discredit, either by his own fault or through the spite of <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            his enemies. The story is that an Athenian named <lb/>
            Diomedes, a respectable man and a friend of Alkibiades, <lb/>
            was desirous of winning a victory at ()lympia. Hearing <lb/>
            that there was a chariot and four which belonged to the <lb/>
            city of Argos, and knowing that Alkibiades had great <lb/>
            influence and many friends in that place, he persuaded <lb/>
            him to buy the chariot for him. Alkibiades, however, <lb/>
            bought the chariot and entered it for the race as his own, <lb/>
            leaving Diomedes to call upon heaven and earth to witness <lb/>
            his ill-treatment. It appears that a trial took place about <lb/>
            this matter, and Isokrates wrote a speech about this <lb/>
            chariot in defence of the son of Alkibiades, in which <lb/>
            Tisias, not Diomedes, is mentioned as the prosecutor.</p>
          <p>XIII. When, as a mere boy, Alkibiades plunged into <lb/>
            political life, he at once surpassed most of the statesmen <lb/>
            of the age. His chief rivals were Phæax, the son of <lb/>
            Erasistratus, and Nikias, the son of Nikeratus, the latter <lb/>
            a man advanced in life, and bearing the reputation of <lb/>
            being an excellent general, while the former, like Alki­ <lb/>
            biades himself, was a young man of good family, just <lb/>
            rising into notice, but inferior to him in many respects, <lb/>
            particularly in oratory. Though affable and persuasive <lb/>
            in private circles, he could not speak equally well in <lb/>
            public, for he was, as Eupolis says, <lb/>
            “ At conversation best of men, at public speaking worst.”</p>
          <p>In a certain attack on Alkibiades and Phæax, we find, <lb/>
            among other charges, Alkibiades accused of using the <lb/>
            gold and silver plate of the city of Athens as his own <lb/>
            for his daily use.</p>
          <p>There was at Athens one Hyperbolus, of the township <lb/>
            of Peirithois, whom Thucydides mentions as a worthless <lb/>
            man, and one who was constantly ridiculed by the comic <lb/>
            dramatists. From his utter disregard of what was said <lb/>
            of him, and his carelessness for his honour, which, though <lb/>
            it was mere shameless impudence and apathy, was thought <lb/>
            by some to show firmness and true courage, he was <lb/>
            pleasing to no party, but frequently made use of by the <lb/>
            people when they wished to have a scurrilous attack made <lb/>
            upon those in power. At this time he was about to <lb/>
            resort to the proceeding called ostracism, by which from <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            time to time the Athenians force into exile those citizens <lb/>
            who are remarkable for influence and power, rather <lb/>
            because they envy them than because they fear them.</p>
          <p>But as it was clear that one of the three, Nikias, Pheeax, <lb/>
            and Alkibiades, would be ostracised, Alkibiades combined <lb/>
            their several parties, arranged matters with Nikias, and <lb/>
            turned the ostracism against Hyperbolus himself. Some <lb/>
            say that it was not Nikias but Phæax with whom Alki­ <lb/>
            biades joined interest, and that with the assistance of his <lb/>
            political party he managed to expel Hyperbolus, who <lb/>
            never expected any such treatment; for before that time <lb/>
            this punishment had never been extended to low persons <lb/>
            of no reputation, as Plato, the comic dramatist, says in <lb/>
            the lines where he mentions Hyperbolus: <lb/>
            “ Full worthy to be punished though he be, <lb/>
            Yet ostracism's not for such as he." <lb/>
            We have elsewhere given a fuller account of this affair.</p>
          <p>XIV. Alkibiades was dissatisfied at the respect shown <lb/>
            for Nikias, both by enemies of the State and by the citizens <lb/>
            of Athens. Alkibiades was the proxenus* of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians at Athens, and paid especial court to those <lb/>
            Spartans who had been captured at Pylos; yet, when the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians discovered that it was chiefly by Nikias's <lb/>
            means that they obtained peace, and recovered their <lb/>
            prisoners, they were lavish of their attentions to him. <lb/>
            The common phrase among the Greeks of that time was <lb/>
            that Perikles had begun the war, and Nikias had finished <lb/>
            it; and the peace was usually called the peace of Nikias. <lb/>
            Alkibiades, irritated beyond measure at his rival's success, <lb/>
            began to meditate how he could destroy the existing <lb/>
            treaty. He perceived that the Argives, hating and <lb/>
            fearing Sparta, wished to break off from it, and he en­ <lb/>
            couraged them by secret assurances of an Athenian <lb/>
            alliance, and also both by his agents and in person he <lb/>
            urged the leading men not to give way to the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, or yield any points to them, but to turn to <lb/>
            Athens, and await their co-operation, for the Athenians, <lb/>
            he said, already began to regret that they had made peace <lb/>
            at all, and would soon break it. <note type="footnote"> 0 An office resembling that of a modem consul for a foreign nation. </note></p><pb n="328"/>
            
          <p>When the Lacedæmonians made an alliance with the <lb/>
            Boeotians, and delivered up Panaktus to the Athenians in <lb/>
            a dismantled condition, not with its walls standing, as <lb/>
            they ought to have done, Alkibiades exasperated the rage <lb/>
            of the Athenians by his speeches, and raised a clamour <lb/>
            against Nikias by the plausible accusation that he, when <lb/>
            general, had hung back from capturing the enemy's forces <lb/>
            which were cut off in the island of Sphakteria, and that <lb/>
            when they had been captured by another, he had released <lb/>
            them and restored them to their homes, in order to gain <lb/>
            the favour of the Lacedæmonians. And for all that, <lb/>
            although he was such a friend of the Lacedæmonians, he <lb/>
            had not dissuaded them from forming alliances with <lb/>
            Corinth and with the Bœotians, while he prevented the <lb/>
            Athenians from becoming allies of any Greek State which <lb/>
            might wish it, if the step did not happen to please the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>Upon this, while Nikias was smarting under these <lb/>
            accusations, ambassadors arrived from Lacedæmon with in­ <lb/>
            structions to propose reasonable terms, and announcing <lb/>
            that they came with full powers to conclude the negotia­ <lb/>
            lions for peace on an equitable basis. The Senate received <lb/>
            them willingly, and next day they were to appear before <lb/>
            the people. Fearing that they would succeed, Alkibiades <lb/>
            contrived to obtain a private interview with them, in <lb/>
            which he addressed them as follows : “ What is this that <lb/>
            you do, men of Sparta Do you not know that the <lb/>
            Senate always treats those who appear before it in a kindly <lb/>
            and reasonable manner, but the people are always full of <lb/>
            pride and ambition ? If you say that you have plenary <lb/>
            powers, they will bewilder you by their violence and force <lb/>
            great concessions from you. So come, cease this folly, if you <lb/>
            wish to negotiate with the Athenians in a moderate way, <lb/>
            and not to be forced into conceding points against your will. <lb/>
            Discuss all the points at issue, but do not say that you have <lb/>
            full power to decide them. I will do my best to assist <lb/>
            you, as a friend to Lacedæmon.” After these words he <lb/>
            confirmed his promise by an oath, and thus completely <lb/>
            detached them from Nikias and left them trusting him <lb/>
            only, and admiring him as a man of remarkable sense <lb/>
            and intelligence. On the following day the people <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            assembled, and the ambassadors appeared before them. <lb/>
            When they were politely asked by Alkibiades in what <lb/>
            capacity they came, they said that they were not pleni­ <lb/>
            potentiaries. Immediately upon this Alkibiades assailed <lb/>
            them with furious invective, as though they, not he, were <lb/>
            in the wrong, calling them faithless equivocators, who had <lb/>
            not come either to speak or to do anything honest. The <lb/>
            Senate was vexed at its treatment, and the people were <lb/>
            excessively enraged, while Nikias, who knew nothing of <lb/>
            the trick, was astounded and covered with confusion at <lb/>
            the conduct of the ambassadors.</p>
          <p>XV. The Lacedæmonian alliance being put an end to <lb/>
            by this means, Alkibiades, who was now elected one of the <lb/>
            generals of Athens, at once formed an alliance with <lb/>
            Argos, Elis and Mantinea. No one approved of the way <lb/>
            in which he effected this, but still the result was very <lb/>
            important, as it agitated all the States in Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            and set them against one another, brought so many men <lb/>
            into line to fight the Lacedæmonians at the battle of <lb/>
            Mantinea, and removed the scene of conflict so far from <lb/>
            Athens, that the Lacedæmonians could gain no great ad­ <lb/>
            vantage by victory, whereas if they failed, they would have <lb/>
            to struggle for their very existence. After this battle the <lb/>
            select regiment at Argos, called the " Thousand," en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to overthrow the government and establish <lb/>
            themselves as masters of the city; and with the assistance <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians they destroyed the constitution. <lb/>
            But the people took up arms again, and defeated the <lb/>
            usurpers: and Alkibiades coming to their aid, made the <lb/>
            victory of the popular side more complete. He persuaded <lb/>
            the citizens to build long walls down to the sea, and to <lb/>
            trust entirely to the Athenian naval forces for support. <lb/>
            He even sent them carpenters and stonemasons from <lb/>
            Athens, and showed great zeal on their behalf, which <lb/>
            tended to increase his personal interest and power no less <lb/>
            than that of his country. He advised the people of Patræ <lb/>
            also to join their city to the sea by long walls; and when <lb/>
            some one said to the people of Patræ, that the Athenians <lb/>
            would swallow them up, he answered, " Perhaps they may, <lb/>
            but it will be by degrees and beginning with the feet, <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            whereas the Lacedæmonians will seize them by the head <lb/>
            and do it at once."</p>
          <p>However, Alkibiades ever pressed the Athenians to <lb/>
            establish their empire by land as well as by sea, re­ <lb/>
            minding them of the oath which the young men take in <lb/>
            the Temple of Agraulos, and which it was their duty to <lb/>
            confirm by their deeds. This oath is, that they will <lb/>
            regard wheat, barley, vines and olives as the boundaries <lb/>
            of Attica, by which it is hinted that they ought to make <lb/>
            all cultivated and fruitful lands their own.</p>
          <p>XVI. In the midst of all this display of political <lb/>
            ability, eloquence, and statesmanlike prudence, he lived a <lb/>
            life of great luxury, debauchery, and profuse expenditure, <lb/>
            swaggering through the market-place with his long <lb/>
            effeminate mantle trailing on the ground. He had the <lb/>
            deck of his trireme cut away, that he might sleep more <lb/>
            comfortably, having his bed slung on girths instead of rest­ <lb/>
            ing on the planks ; and he carried a shield not emblazoned <lb/>
            with the ancestral bearings of his family, but with a <lb/>
            Cupid wielding a thunderbolt. The leading men of Athens <lb/>
            viewed his conduct with disgust and apprehension, fearing <lb/>
            his scornful and overbearing manner, as being nearly <lb/>
            allied to the demeanour of a despot, while Aristophanes <lb/>
            has expressed the feeling of the people towards him in <lb/>
            the line, <lb/>
            “ They love, they hate, they cannot live without him.” <lb/>
            And again he alludes to him in a bitterer spirit in the <lb/>
            verse: <lb/>
            “ A lion's cub 'tis best you should not rear, <lb/>
            For if you do, your master he'll appear." <lb/>
            His voluntary contributions of money to the State, his <lb/>
            public exhibitions and services, and displays of muni­ <lb/>
            ficence, which could not be equalled in splendour, his <lb/>
            noble birth, his persuasive speech, his strength, beauty, <lb/>
            and bravery, and all his other shining qualities, combined <lb/>
            to make the Athenians endure him, and always give his <lb/>
            errors the mildest names, calling them youthful escapades <lb/>
            and honourable emulation. For example, he locked up <lb/>
            Agatharchus the painter, and when he had painted his <lb/>
            house let him go with a present. He boxed Taurea's <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            ears because he was exhibiting shows in rivalry with <lb/>
            him, and contending with him for the prize. And he <lb/>
            even took one of the captive Melian women for his <lb/>
            mistress, and brought up a child which he had by her. <lb/>
            This was thought to show his good nature; but this <lb/>
            term cannot be applied to the slaughter of all the males <lb/>
            above puberty in the island of Melos, which was done in <lb/>
            accordance with a decree promoted by Alkibiades.</p>
          <p>When Aristophon painted the courtesan Nemea em­ <lb/>
            bracing Alkibiades, all men eagerly crowded to see it; <lb/>
            but older men were vexed at these things too, thinking <lb/>
            them only fit for despots, and considering them to be <lb/>
            open violations of the laws. Indeed Archestratus spoke <lb/>
            very much to the purpose when he said that Greece could <lb/>
            not bear more than one Alkibiades. Once, when Alki­ <lb/>
            biades had made a successful speech in the public as­ <lb/>
            sembly, and was being conducted home in triumph by his <lb/>
            friends, Timon the misanthrope met him, and did not get <lb/>
            out of his way, as he did to every one else, but came up <lb/>
            to him and took him by the hand, saying, “ Go on, my <lb/>
            boy, increase in glory; for your increase will bring ruin <lb/>
            to all this crowd." Some laughed, some cursed him, but <lb/>
            others took his words to heart. So various were the <lb/>
            opinions formed about Alkibiades, because of the in­ <lb/>
            consistency of his character.</p>
          <p>XVII. Even during the lifetime of Perikles, the <lb/>
            Athenians had a hankering after Sicily, and after his <lb/>
            death they endeavoured to obtain possession of it, by <lb/>
            sending troops to the assistance of those cities which <lb/>
            were oppressed by the Syracusans, and thus paving the <lb/>
            way for a greater armament. It was, however, Alkibiades <lb/>
            who fanned their desires into a flame, and who persuaded <lb/>
            them to abandon these half-hearted attempts, to proceed <lb/>
            with a great force to the island, and to endeavour to <lb/>
            subdue it. He raised great expectations among the <lb/>
            people, but his own aspirations were far more en tensive ; <lb/>
            for he regarded the conquest of Sicily not merely as an <lb/>
            end, but as a stepping-stone to greater things. While <lb/>
            Nikias was dissuading the people from the attempt, on <lb/>
            the ground that it would be a difficult matter to capture <lb/>
            the city of Syracuse, Alkibiades was dreaming of Car­ <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            thage and Libya; and after these were gained, he medi. <lb/>
            tated the conquest of Italy and of Peloponnesus, regarding <lb/>
            Sicily as little more than a convenient magazine and place <lb/>
            of arms. He greatly excited the younger Athenians by his <lb/>
            vast designs, and they listened eagerly to the marvellous <lb/>
            stories of the old who had served in that country ; so that <lb/>
            many of them would spend their time sitting in the <lb/>
            gymnasia and public seats, drawing sketches of the shape <lb/>
            of the island of Sicily, and of the position of Libya and <lb/>
            Carthage. It is said that Sokrates the philosopher, and <lb/>
            Meton the astronomer, did not expect that the state would <lb/>
            gain any advantage from this expedition; the former <lb/>
            probably receiving a presentiment of disaster, as was his <lb/>
            wont, from his familiar spirit. Meton either made calcu­ <lb/>
            lations which led him to fear what was about to happen, <lb/>
            or else gathered it from the art of prophecy. He feigned <lb/>
            madness, and seizing a torch, attempted to set his house on <lb/>
            fire. Some say that Meton made no pretence of madness, <lb/>
            but that he burned down his house one night, and next <lb/>
            morning came and besought the Athenians, after such a <lb/>
            misfortune, to exempt his son from serving with the <lb/>
            expedition. Thus he deceived his fellow citizens and <lb/>
            carried his point.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Nikias, much against his will, was chosen to <lb/>
            lead the expedition. His unwillingness was in a great <lb/>
            measure due to the fact that Alkibiades was to act as his <lb/>
            colleague; for the Athenians thought that the war would <lb/>
            be conducted better if the rashness of Alkibiades was <lb/>
            tempered by the prudence of Nikias, because the third <lb/>
            general, Lamachus, although advanced in years, yet had <lb/>
            the reputation of being no less daring and reckless a <lb/>
            soldier than Alkibiades himself.</p>
          <p>When the public assembly were debating about the <lb/>
            number of the troops and the preparation for the arma­ <lb/>
            ment, Nikias made another attempt to oppose the whole <lb/>
            measure and to put a stop to the war. Alkibiades, <lb/>
            however, took the other side and carried all before him. <lb/>
            The orator Demostratus moved, that the generals <lb/>
            should be empowered to demand whatever stores and war <lb/>
            material they pleased, and have absolute power to carry <lb/>
            on the wai at their own discretion. This was agreed to <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            by the people, and all was ready for setting sail, when <lb/>
            unlucky omens occurred. The festival of Adonis took <lb/>
            place at that very time, and during it the women carry <lb/>
            about in many parts of the city figures dressed like <lb/>
            corpses going to be buried, and imitate the ceremony of a <lb/>
            funeral by tearing their hair and singing dirges. And <lb/>
            besides this, the mutilation of the Hermæ in one night, <lb/>
            when all of them had their faces disfigured, disturbed <lb/>
            many even of those who, as a rule, despised such things. <lb/>
            A story was put about that the Corinthians, of whom the <lb/>
            Syracusans were a colony, had done it, hoping that such <lb/>
            an evil omen might make the Athenians either postpone <lb/>
            or give up their expedition. But the people paid no heed <lb/>
            to this insinuation, and still less to those who argued <lb/>
            that there was no omen in the matter at all, but that it <lb/>
            was the work of extravagant young men after their <lb/>
            wine. They regarded the incident with feelings of rage <lb/>
            and fear, imagining that it proved the existence of an <lb/>
            organised plot aimed at greater matters. Both the Senate <lb/>
            and the General Assembly met several times during the <lb/>
            next few days, and inquired sharply into every thing <lb/>
            that could throw any light upon it.</p>
          <p>XIX. During this time, Androkles, a popular speaker, <lb/>
            brought forward several slaves and resident aliens, who <lb/>
            charged Alkibiades and his friends with mutilating certain <lb/>
            other statues, and with parodying the ceremonies of <lb/>
            initiation to the sacred mysteries when in their cups. <lb/>
            They said that the part of the Herald was taken by <lb/>
            Theodorus, that of the Torch-bearer by Polytion, and that <lb/>
            of Hierophant by Alkibiades himself, while the rest of <lb/>
            the company were present and were initiated, and were <lb/>
            addressed by them as Mysts, which means persons who <lb/>
            have been initiated into the mysteries. These are the <lb/>
            charges which we find specified in the indictment drawn <lb/>
            against Alkibiades by Thessalus the son of Kimon, in <lb/>
            which he accuses Alkibiades of sacrilege against the <lb/>
            two goddesses, Demeter (Ceres) and Proserpine. The <lb/>
            people now became very much enraged with Alkibiades, <lb/>
            and were still more exasperated by his personal enemy <lb/>
            Androkles. Alkibiades was at first alarmed, but soon <lb/>
            perceived that all the sailors of the fleet about to sail to <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            Sicily were on his side, as were also the soldiers. A body <lb/>
            of a thousand Argives and Mantineans also were heard to <lb/>
            say that they were going to cross the seas and fight in a <lb/>
            distant land all for the sake of Alkibiades, and that if he <lb/>
            did not meet with fair play, they would at once desert. <lb/>
            Encouraged by this, he appeared at the appointed time <lb/>
            to defend himself, which disconcerted and disheartened <lb/>
            his enemies, who feared that the people might deal <lb/>
            leniently with him because they required his services. <lb/>
            Matters being in this posture, they prevailed upon some <lb/>
            of the orators who were not known to be enemies to <lb/>
            Alkibiades, but who hated him nevertheless, to move <lb/>
            before the people that it was an absurd proceeding for <lb/>
            the irresponsible general of so great a force of Athe­ <lb/>
            nians and their allies to waste his time while the court <lb/>
            was drawing lots for the jury, and filling water-clocks <lb/>
            with water. “ Let him sail, and may good luck attend <lb/>
            him, and when the war is finished let him return and <lb/>
            speak in his defence, for the laws will be the same then <lb/>
            as now." Alkibiades saw clearly their malicious object <lb/>
            in postponing his trial, and said publicly that it was very <lb/>
            hard to leave such accusations and slanders behind him, <lb/>
            and to be sent out in command of a great expedition with <lb/>
            such a terrible fate hanging over him. If he could not <lb/>
            prove his innocence, he ought to be put to death; and if <lb/>
            he could clear himself of these charges, it was only just <lb/>
            that he should be enabled to attack the enemy with a <lb/>
            light heart, without having to fear false accusers at home.</p>
          <p>XX. He did not, however, succeed in this, but was <lb/>
            ordered to sail, and put to sea with his colleagues, having <lb/>
            under their orders a fleet of nearly one hundred and <lb/>
            forty triremes, five thousand one hundred heavy-armed <lb/>
            troops, archers, slingers, and light-armed troops to the <lb/>
            number of about thirteen hundred, and all other stores <lb/>
            and provisions in proportion. After reaching Italy and <lb/>
            capturing Rhegium, he gave his opinion as to the manner <lb/>
            in which the war ought to be conducted; but as Nikias <lb/>
            opposed him and was joined by Lamachus, he sailed over <lb/>
            to Sicily and induced the city of Catana to join them, but <lb/>
            did nothing further, because he was sent for at once to <lb/>
            return and stand his trial at Athens. At first, as we <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            have stated, Alkibiades was only vaguely suspected, and <lb/>
            only the testimony of slaves and resident aliens could be <lb/>
            obtained against him; but afterwards, during his absence, <lb/>
            his enemies had worked hard to get up a case against <lb/>
            him, and connected his sacrilegious conduct about the <lb/>
            mysteries with the mutilation of the Hermæ, which they <lb/>
            argued were all the work of one body of conspirators, <lb/>
            bent upon revolution and the destruction of the existing <lb/>
            form of government. All those who were in any degree <lb/>
            implicated were cast into prison without a trial, and they <lb/>
            were much vexed they had not immediately brought <lb/>
            Alkibiades to trial and obtained judgment against him on <lb/>
            such grave charges as these. Any of his friends, relations, <lb/>
            or acquaintances who fell into their hands received very <lb/>
            harsh treatment.</p>
          <p>Thucydides has omitted the names of those who <lb/>
            impeached him, but others give their names as Diokleides <lb/>
            and Teukrus, among whom is Phrynichus the comic <lb/>
            dramatist, who writes as follows :— <lb/>
            “ And, dearest Hermes, do not fall <lb/>
            And break your head; and, worst of all, <lb/>
            To some new Diokleides show the way, <lb/>
            By slander base to swear men's lives away." <lb/>
            And again Hermes says: <lb/>
            “ I will not fall. I will not for my pains <lb/>
            Let Teukrus fatten on informers' gains.-</p>
          <p>Though really the informers brought no decided evidence <lb/>
            forward for any important charge, one of them, when <lb/>
            asked how he recognised the faces of the statue-breakers, <lb/>
            answered that he saw them by the light of the moon : a <lb/>
            signal falsehood, because it was done on the night of <lb/>
            the new moon. This answer made the more thoughtful <lb/>
            citizens unwilling to press the charge, but had no effect <lb/>
            whatever on the people, who were as eager as ever, and <lb/>
            continued to cast into prison any man who might be <lb/>
            informed against.</p>
          <p>XXI. One of those who was imprisoned was the orator <lb/>
            Andokides, whom Hellanikus, the historian, reckons as a <lb/>
            descendant of Odysseus (Ulysses). Andokides was thought <lb/>
            to be a man of aristocratic and antipopular sentiments, <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            and what made him particularly suspected of having <lb/>
            taken part in the statue-breaking, was that the large <lb/>
            statue of Hermes, near his house, the gift of the tribe <lb/>
            Ægeis, was one of the very few which remained unbroken. <lb/>
            \\ herefore even at the present day it is called the Hermes <lb/>
            of Andokides, and everyone speaks of it by that name in <lb/>
            spite of the inscription on it.</p>
          <p>It happened that Andokides, while in custody, formed <lb/>
            an acquaintance and friendship for one of the other <lb/>
            persons who were imprisoned on the same charge, a man <lb/>
            of the name of Timæus, of inferior birth and position to <lb/>
            himself, but much cleverer and more courageous. This <lb/>
            man persuaded Andokides to inform against himself and <lb/>
            some few others, because, by a decree of the people, any <lb/>
            one who acted as informer was to be given a free pardon, <lb/>
            whereas no one could count upon the results of a trial, <lb/>
            which the more prominent citizens had especial reasons <lb/>
            for dreading. He pointed out that it was better to save <lb/>
            his life by a lie than to be put to death with infamy as <lb/>
            if he was really guilty; moreover, looking at the whole <lb/>
            affair, it was best to sacrifice a few persons of doubtful <lb/>
            character to the fury of the people, and thereby to save <lb/>
            many good men from becoming its victims. Andokides <lb/>
            was convinced by these arguments of Timæus, and by in­ <lb/>
            forming against himself and some others obtained a pardon <lb/>
            for himself, while all those whose names he mentioned <lb/>
            were put to death, except such as had fled the country.</p>
          <p>To procure greater credit to his information, Andokides <lb/>
            even accused his own servants. However, the people did <lb/>
            not abate their rage, but, ceasing to take any further <lb/>
            interest in the statue-breakers, they turned savagely <lb/>
            against Alkibiades. Finally, they despatched the Sala­ <lb/>
            minian trireme after him, ingeniously ordering its officers <lb/>
            not to use any personal violence, but to speak him fair <lb/>
            and bid him return to stand his trial and set himself right <lb/>
            with the people.</p>
          <p>They were afraid of an outbreak, or even of a mutiny <lb/>
            in the army in Sicily, which Alkibiades could have raised <lb/>
            with the greatest ease, if he had wished to do so. Indeed, <lb/>
            the soldiers became disheartened when he left them, and <lb/>
            looked forward to long delays and periods of dull inaction <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            under Nikias's command, now that he who used to spur <lb/>
            matters on was gone. Lamachus, indeed, was a brave and <lb/>
            skilful soldier, but his poverty prevented his opinions <lb/>
            from carrying their due weight.</p>
          <p>XXII. Alkibiades the moment he sailed away lost <lb/>
            Messina for the Athenians. There was a party in that <lb/>
            city ready to deliver it up, which he knew well. and by <lb/>
            disclosing their intentions to the Syracusan party he <lb/>
            effectually ruined the plot. At Thurii he landed, and <lb/>
            concealed himself so that he could not be found. When <lb/>
            one of his friends said to him, “ Alkibiades, do you not <lb/>
            trust your native country ? " He answered, “ Yes, in other <lb/>
            matters; but when my life is at stake I would not trust <lb/>
            my own mother, for fear that she might mistake a black <lb/>
            bean for a white one." Afterwards hearing that the <lb/>
            Athenians had condemned him to death, he said, " I will <lb/>
            show them that I am still alive."</p>
          <p>The indictment against him is framed thus:</p>
          <p>" Thessalus, the son of Kimon, of the township of Lakia, <lb/>
            accuses Alkibiades, the son of Kleinias, of the township <lb/>
            of the Skambonidæ, of sacrilege against the two goddesses, <lb/>
            Demeter and Kora, by parodying the sacred mysteries <lb/>
            and giving a representation of them in his own house, <lb/>
            wearing himself such a robe as the Hierophant does when <lb/>
            he shows the holy things, and calling himself the Hiero­ <lb/>
            phant, Poulytion, the Torch-bearer, Theodorus, of the <lb/>
            township of Phegæa, the Herald, and addressing the rest <lb/>
            of the company as Mysts and Epopts (Initiates and <lb/>
            Novices), contrary to the rules and ceremonies established <lb/>
            by the Eumolpidæ, and Kerykes, and the priests of <lb/>
            Eleusis." As he did not appear, they condemned him, <lb/>
            forfeited his goods, and even caused all the priests and <lb/>
            priestesses to curse him publicly. It is said that Theano, <lb/>
            the daughter of Menon, the priestess of the temple of <lb/>
            Agraulos, was the only one who refused to carry out this <lb/>
            decree, alleging that it was to pray and not to curse that <lb/>
            she had become a priestess.</p>
          <p>XXIIL While these terrible decrees and sentences <lb/>
            were being passed against Alkibiades, he was living at <lb/>
            Argos; for as soon as he left Thurii, he fled to the <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, where, terrified at the violence of his enemies, <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            he determined to abandon his country, and sent to Sparta <lb/>
            demanding a safe asylum, on the strength of a promise <lb/>
            that he would do the Spartans more good than he had in <lb/>
            time past done them harm. The Spartans agreed to his <lb/>
            request, and invited him to come. On his arrival, he at <lb/>
            once effected one important matter, by stirring up the <lb/>
            dilatory Spartans to send Gylippus at once to Syracuse <lb/>
            with reinforcements for that city, to destroy the Athenian <lb/>
            army in Sicily. Next, he brought them to declare war <lb/>
            against the Athenians themselves; while his third and <lb/>
            most terrible blow to Athens was his causing the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians to seize and fortify Dekeleia, which did more <lb/>
            to ruin Athens than any other measure throughout the <lb/>
            war. With his great public reputation, Alkibiades was <lb/>
            no less popular in private life, and he deluded the people <lb/>
            by pretending to adopt the Laconian habits. When they <lb/>
            saw him closely shaved, bathing in cold water, eating <lb/>
            dry bread and black broth, they wondered, and began to <lb/>
            doubt whether this man ever had kept a professed cook, <lb/>
            used perfumes, or endured to wear a Milesian mantle. <lb/>
            For Alkibiades, among his other extraordinary qualities, <lb/>
            had this especial art of captivating men by assimilating <lb/>
            his own manners and habits to theirs, being able to <lb/>
            change, more quickly than the chameleon, from one mode <lb/>
            of life to another. The chameleon, indeed, cannot -turn <lb/>
            itself white; but Alkibiades never found anything, good <lb/>
            or bad, which he could not imitate to the life. Thus at <lb/>
            Sparta he was fond of exercise, frugal and severe; in <lb/>
            Ionia, luxurious, frivolous, and lazy ; in Thrace, he drank <lb/>
            deep; in Thessaly he proved himself a good horseman; <lb/>
            while, when he was consorting with the satrap Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            he outdid even the Persian splendour and pomp. It was <lb/>
            not his real character that he so often and so easily changed, <lb/>
            but as he knew that if he appeared in his true colours, <lb/>
            he would be universally disliked, he concealed his real self <lb/>
            under an apparent adoption of the ways and fashions of <lb/>
            whatever place he was in. In Lacedæmon you would say, <lb/>
            looking at his appearance, <lb/>
            “’Tis not Achilles’ son, 'tis he himself."</p>
          <p>He was just such a man as Lykurgus himself would <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            have trained ; but if you examined his habits and actions <lb/>
            more closely, you would say: <lb/>
            " 'Tis the same woman still." <lb/>
            For while King Agis was away in the wars, Alkibiades <lb/>
            seduced his wife Timæa, so that she became pregnant by <lb/>
            v him, and did not even deny the fact. When her child <lb/>
            was born it was called Leotychides in public, but in her <lb/>
            own house she whispered to her friends and attendants <lb/>
            that his name was Alkibiades, so greatly was she ena­ <lb/>
            moured of him. He himself used to say in jest that he <lb/>
            had not acted thus out of wanton passion, but in order <lb/>
            that his race might one day rule in Lacedæmon. King <lb/>
            Agis heard of all this from many informants, but was <lb/>
            most convinced of its truth by a computation of the time <lb/>
            before the birth of the child. Terrified at an earthquake, <lb/>
            he had once quitted his wife's chamber, and for ten <lb/>
            months afterwards had never conversed with her. As it <lb/>
            was at the end of this period that Leotychides was born, <lb/>
            he declared that the child was not his; and for this <lb/>
            reason he never succeeded to the throne.</p>
          <p>XXIV. After the Athenian disaster in Sicily, ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors came to Sparta from Chios, Lesbos, and Kyzikus. <lb/>
            The claims of the Lesbians were favoured by the Bœo­ <lb/>
            tians, and those of the people of Kyzikus by Pharnabazus; <lb/>
            but, at the recommendation of Alkibiades, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians decided to give the preference to the Chians. <lb/>
            He himself sailed to that island, caused nearly the whole <lb/>
            of the cities of Ionia to revolt from Athens, and injured <lb/>
            the Athenian cause much by constantly assisting the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian generals. King Agis, however, was already <lb/>
            his personal enemy, because of Alkibiades's intrigue with <lb/>
            his wife, and now was enraged at his successes; for it <lb/>
            was said that scarcely anything was done without Alki­ <lb/>
            biades. The other leading men in Sparta also hated <lb/>
            Alkibiades, because he had thrown them into the shade; <lb/>
            and they had sufficient influence with the home govern­ <lb/>
            ment to obtain an order for hia execution, to be sent to <lb/>
            the generals in Ionia.</p>
          <p>Alkibiades received warning of this in good time. <lb/>
            Alarmed at the news, he still continued to co-operate <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            with the Lacedæmonians, but utterly refused to trust <lb/>
            his person among them. To ensure his safety, he betook <lb/>
            himself to Tissaphernes, the satrap or viceroy for the <lb/>
            king of Persia in that province, and at once became the <lb/>
            most important personage amongst his followers. The <lb/>
            barbarian being himself a lover of deceit and of crooked <lb/>
            ways, admired his cleverness and versatility; while no <lb/>
            mania nature could resist the fascinations and charms of <lb/>
            the society of Alkibiades, which Tissaphernes now en­ <lb/>
            joyed daily. Although he hated the Greeks as much as <lb/>
            any Persian, yet he was so overpowered by the flatteries <lb/>
            of Alkibiades, that he in his turn repaid him with com­ <lb/>
            pliments even more excessive. He decreed that the <lb/>
            pleasantest of his parks, a place charmingly wooded <lb/>
            and watered, with delightful walks and summer-houses, <lb/>
            should be called " the Alkibiades;" and all men from <lb/>
            that time forth spoke of it by that name.</p>
          <p>XXV. Now that Alkibiades had determined that the <lb/>
            Spartans were not to be trusted, and that he was in fear <lb/>
            of Agis, their king, he began to speak evil of them to <lb/>
            Tissaphernes, withholding him from assisting them <lb/>
            thoroughly, and enabling them to conquer the Athenians, <lb/>
            but advising him rather to starve the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            forces by insufficient supplies, so as to play one side off <lb/>
            against the other, and thus encourage them to wear each <lb/>
            other out, in order that in the end both might be so <lb/>
            weakened as to fall an easy prey to the Persians.</p>
          <p>Tissaphernes at once adopted this policy, and made no <lb/>
            secret of his regard and admiration for Alkibiades, who <lb/>
            was now looked up to by the Greeks on both sides, while <lb/>
            the Athenians repented of their decrees against him. He <lb/>
            also began to fear that if their city were to be utterly <lb/>
            destroyed he would necessarily fall into the hands of his <lb/>
            enemies, the Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>The most important post in the Athenian empire at <lb/>
            this time was the island of Samos. Here lay the greater <lb/>
            part of their fleet, and it was from this headquarters that <lb/>
            they sent out expeditions to recover the revolted cities of <lb/>
            Ionia, and guarded those which they still retained, as, in <lb/>
            spite of their great losses, they still possessed a fleet <lb/>
            capable of holding its own against the Lacedaemonians. <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            They were in great fear of Tissaphernes and the Phoenician <lb/>
            fleet of a hundred and fifty sail of triremes, which was <lb/>
            said to be on the point of arriving, because if it really <lb/>
            came all would be over with Athens. Alkibiades, knowing <lb/>
            this, sent a secret message to the Athenian leaders at <lb/>
            Samos, holding out hopes of bringing Tissaphernes over <lb/>
            to the Athenian side. He would not, he said, do this to <lb/>
            please the populace of Athens, because he could not trust <lb/>
            them, but he would effect it if the nobility would, like <lb/>
            brave gentlemen, put an end to the insolent behaviour of <lb/>
            the lower orders, and would themselves undertake to save <lb/>
            the city and empire of Athens.</p>
          <p>All were eager to adopt the proposal of Alkibiades, <lb/>
            except Phrynichus of the demos or township of Deirades, <lb/>
            who suspected the real truth, that Alkibiades cared <lb/>
            nothing about the form of government which might be <lb/>
            established at Athens, but was seeking for some excuse <lb/>
            for being restored to his native country, and thought, <lb/>
            by his harsh language about the people, to ingratiate <lb/>
            himself with the nobles. He was, however, overruled; <lb/>
            and, being now clearly marked as the personal enemy of <lb/>
            Alkibiades, sent a secret message to Astyochus, the <lb/>
            admiral of the Lacedaemonian fleet, bidding him beware <lb/>
            of Alkibiades, who was playing a double game. However, <lb/>
            he met his match in perfidy. Astyochus, desirous of <lb/>
            gaining the favour of Tissaphernes, and seeing that <lb/>
            Alkibiades had great influence with him, betrayed <lb/>
            Phrynichus's letter to them. Alkibiades upon this at once <lb/>
            sent persons to Samos to charge Phrynichus with this act <lb/>
            of treason, and he, seeing that all men were shocked at <lb/>
            what he had done, and were indignant with him, and <lb/>
            being at his wit's end, endeavoured to heal one mischief <lb/>
            by another. He sent a second letter to Astyochus, <lb/>
            reproaching him for his betrayal of confidence, and <lb/>
            promising that he would enable him to capture the fleet <lb/>
            and camp of the Athenians. However, the treachery of <lb/>
            Phrynichus did no harm to the Athenians, because of the <lb/>
            counter treachery of Astyochus, who communicated this <lb/>
            letter also to Alkibiades. Now Phrynichus, expecting a <lb/>
            second charge of treason from Alkibiades, was beforehand <lb/>
            with him, in announcing to the Athenians that the enemy <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            were about to attack them, and advising them to keep <lb/>
            near their ships, and to fortify their camp.- This they <lb/>
            proceeded to do, when there came a second letter from <lb/>
            Alkibiades, warning them against Phrynichus, who medi­ <lb/>
            tated betraying the harbour to the enemy. This letter <lb/>
            was not believed at the time, for men imagined that <lb/>
            Alkibiades, who knew perfectly well all the movements <lb/>
            and intentions of the enemy, was making use of that <lb/>
            knowledge to destroy his personal enemy Phrynichus, by <lb/>
            exciting an undeserved suspicion against him. Yet, when <lb/>
            afterwards Hermon, one of the Athenian horse-patrol, <lb/>
            stabbed Phrynichus with his dagger in the market-place, <lb/>
            the Athenians, after trying the case, decided that the <lb/>
            deceased was guilty of treason, and crowned Hermon and <lb/>
            his comrades with garlands.</p>
          <p>XXVI. The friends of Alkibiades being in a majority <lb/>
            at Samos, now despatched Peisander to Athens to attempt <lb/>
            the subversion of the republic, and to encourage the nobles <lb/>
            to seize the government, and put an end to the democratic <lb/>
            constitution. If this was done, they conceived that <lb/>
            Alkibiades would make Tissaphernes their friend and <lb/>
            ally, and this was the pretext and excuse put forward by <lb/>
            those who established the oligarchy. When, however, <lb/>
            the so-called Five Thousand, who really were the Four <lb/>
            Hundred, were at the head of affairs, they paid but little <lb/>
            attention to Alkibiades, and were very remiss in carrying <lb/>
            on the war, partly because they distrusted the citizens, <lb/>
            who were not yet accustomed to the new constitution, <lb/>
            and partly because they thought that the Lacedaemonians, <lb/>
            who were always favourable to oligarchical governments, <lb/>
            would deal more tenderly with them on that account. The <lb/>
            Athenian populace remained quiet, though sorely against <lb/>
            its will, because of the terror inspired by the oligarchs, <lb/>
            for no small number of citizens who had opposed the <lb/>
            Four Hundred had been put to death; but the men of <lb/>
            Samos, as soon as they heard the news, were indignant, <lb/>
            and wished at once to sail to Peiræus. They sent at once <note type="footnote"> * The ancient trireme was not habitable, like a modern ship of <lb/>
            war. The crew always, if possible, landed for their meals, and when <lb/>
            stationed at any place, drew the ship up on the beach and lived entirely <lb/>
            on shore. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            for Alkibiades, elected him their general, and bade him <lb/>
            lead them on to crush this new despotism. Alkibiades on <lb/>
            this occasion acted like a really great commander, and not <lb/>
            at all as one would expect of a man who had suddenly <lb/>
            been raised to power by popular favour.</p>
          <p>He refused to curry favour with the soldiery by carrying <lb/>
            out their wishes, regardless of their having found him a <lb/>
            homeless exile, and having made him the commander of <lb/>
            so many ships and so many men; but he resisted their <lb/>
            impulse, and by preventing their committing so great an <lb/>
            error, without doubt saved the Athenian empire. For if <lb/>
            the fleet had left Samos, the enemy could without a battle <lb/>
            have made themselves masters of the whole of Ionia, the <lb/>
            Hellespont, and the islands in the Ægean, while Athenians <lb/>
            would have fought with Athenians in their own city. All <lb/>
            this was prevented by Alkibiades alone, who not only <lb/>
            persuaded the populace, and pointed out the folly of such <lb/>
            proceedings in public speeches, but even entreated and com­ <lb/>
            manded each individual man to remain at Samos. He was <lb/>
            assisted in this by Thrasybulus, of the township of Steiria, <lb/>
            who was present, and spoke in his loud voice, which was <lb/>
            said to be the loudest of any Athenian of his time. This <lb/>
            was a noble achievement of Alkibiades, and so, too, was his <lb/>
            undertaking that the Phoenician fleet, which the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians expected would be sent by the Persian king to <lb/>
            help them, should either be won over to the Athenian <lb/>
            side, or at any rate prevented from joining the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians. In order to effect this, he sailed away in great <lb/>
            haste, and, although the Phoenician fleet was at Aspendus, <lb/>
            yet Tissaphernes brought it no further, and deceived the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. Both parties gave Alkibiades the credit of <lb/>
            having detained it, and more especially the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            who imagined that he was teaching the Persians to allow <lb/>
            the Greeks to destroy one another, for it was perfectly clear <lb/>
            that such a force, if added to either of the contending <lb/>
            parties, must have made them complete masters of the sea.</p>
          <p>XXVII. After this the government of the Four Hundred <lb/>
            was dissolved, as the friends of Alkibiades eagerly took <lb/>
            the side of the popular party. Although the Athenians <lb/>
            now wished and even commanded Alkibiades to return to <lb/>
            his native city, yet he felt that he ought not to come home <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            emptyhanded, and owing his restoration to the good <lb/>
            nature of the people, but rather to return after some <lb/>
            glorious achievement. With this intention he at first left <lb/>
            Samos with a few ships and cruised in the seas near <lb/>
            Knidus and Kos; then, hearing that Mindarus, the <lb/>
            Spartan admiral, had gone to the Hellespont with all his <lb/>
            fleet, and that the Athenian fleet had followed him, he <lb/>
            hurried to the assistance of the Athenian commanders.</p>
          <p>Sailing northwards with eighteen triremes he chanced <lb/>
            to arrive towards evening, at the end of a sea-fight off <lb/>
            Abydos, in which neither party had won any decided <lb/>
            advantage. The appearance of his squadron caused very <lb/>
            different feelings among the combatants, for the Athenians <lb/>
            were alarmed, and the enemy encouraged. However, lie <lb/>
            soon hoisted an Athenian flag, and bore down upon that <lb/>
            part of the Peloponnesian fleet which had been hitherto <lb/>
            victorious. He put them to flight, compelled them to <lb/>
            run their ships ashore, and then attacking them, disabled <lb/>
            their ships, and broke them to pieces, forcing the crews <lb/>
            to swim ashore, where Pharnabazus the satrap led a force <lb/>
            to the water's edge to fight for the preservation of the <lb/>
            vessels. In the end the Athenians took thirty ships, <lb/>
            recovered those of their own which had been captured, and <lb/>
            erected a trophy, as victors.</p>
          <p>Alkibiades gained great glory by this splendid piece of <lb/>
            good fortune, and at once went off with rich presents and <lb/>
            a gorgeous military retinue, to display his fresh laurels to <lb/>
            Tissaphernes. He met, however, with a very different <lb/>
            reception to that which he expected, for Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            whose mind had been poisoned against him by the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and who feared that the king might be <lb/>
            displeased with his own dealings with Alkibiades, con­ <lb/>
            sidered that he had arrived at a very opportune moment, <lb/>
            and at once seized him and imprisoned him at Sardis ; <lb/>
            thinking that this arbitrary act would prove to the world <lb/>
            that the other suspicions of an understanding between <lb/>
            them were unfounded.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Thirty days afterwards, Alkibiades by some <lb/>
            means obtained a horse, eluded his guards, and fled for <lb/>
            refuge to Klazomenae. He gave out that he had been <lb/>
            privately released by Tissaphernes himself, in order to <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            disgrace that satrap, and at once sailed to the Athenian <lb/>
            fleet in the Hellespont. Learning that Mindarus and <lb/>
            Pharnabazus were both in the city of Kyzikus, he en­ <lb/>
            couraged his soldiers by a speech, in which he told them <lb/>
            that they would have to fight at sea, on land, and against <lb/>
            the town walls too, for that if they were not completely <lb/>
            victorious they could get no pay. He manned his ships <lb/>
            and proceeded to Prokonessus, ordering all small vessels <lb/>
            which they met to be seized and detained in the interior <lb/>
            of the fleet, in order that the enemy might not learn his <lb/>
            movements. It happened also that a heavy thunderstorm <lb/>
            with rain and darkness assisted his design, as he not only <lb/>
            was unseen by the enemy, but was never suspected of <lb/>
            any intention of attack by the Athenians themselves, who <lb/>
            had given up any idea of going to sea when he ordered them <lb/>
            on board. Little by little the clouds cleared away, and <lb/>
            disclosed the Peloponnesian fleet cruising off the harbour <lb/>
            of Kyzikus. Alkibiades, fearing that if the enemy saw <lb/>
            how numerous his own fleet was, they would take refuge <lb/>
            on shore, ordered the other commanders to remain behind <lb/>
            under easy sail, and himself with forty ships went on <lb/>
            ahead to entice them to an engagement. The Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians, deceived by this manœuvre, at once attacked <lb/>
            these few ships, despising their small numbers. But the <lb/>
            little squadron engaged them until the rest came up, when <lb/>
            they fled ashore in terror. Alkibiades with twenty of the <lb/>
            fastest sailing ships broke through the enemy's line, ran <lb/>
            his ships ashore, landed their crews, and attacked the <lb/>
            fugitives from the enemy's fleet with terrible slaughter. <lb/>
            Mindarus and Pharnabazus now came to the rescue, but <lb/>
            they were beaten back; Mindarus died fighting bravely, <lb/>
            and Pharnabazus only saved himself by flight. By this <lb/>
            battle the Athenians obtained possession of many dead <lb/>
            bodies of their enemies,. many stand of arms, the whole <lb/>
            of the hostile fleet, and the town of Kyzikus, which they <lb/>
            took by storm, putting its Peloponnesian garrison to the <note type="footnote"> 0 The Greeks attached great importance to the burial of the dead. <lb/>
            The usual test of which party had won a battle was, which bide after <lb/>
            it demanded a truce for the burial of the dead. here the possession <lb/>
            of the dead bodies of the enemy is enumerated as one of the proofs of <lb/>
            victory. </note> <lb/>

            sword, as soon as Pharnabazus withdrew his troops. They <lb/>
            now not merely obtained a firm hold on the Hellespont, <lb/>
            but were able to drive the Lacedæmonians from the sea <lb/>
            in all quarters. A despatch was captured, written in the <lb/>
            Laconian fashion, informing the Ephors of the disaster. <lb/>
            “ Our ships are gone; Mindarus is slain; the men are <lb/>
            starving ; we know not what to do."</p>
          <p>XXIX. The men who had served under Alkibiades were <lb/>
            so elated by this victory that they disdained to mix with <lb/>
            the rest of the army, alleging that the others had often <lb/>
            been defeated, and that they were invincible. Indeed, <lb/>
            not long before, Thrasyllus had received a defeat near <lb/>
            Ephesus, upon which the Ephesians erected the brazen <lb/>
            trophy to the disgrace of the Athenians; so that the <lb/>
            soldiers of Alkibiades reproached those of Thrasyllus with <lb/>
            this, glorifying themselves and their commander, and <lb/>
            refusing to allow the others to make use of their places <lb/>
            of exercise or their quarters in camp. However, when <lb/>
            Pharnabazus with a large force of infantry and calvary <lb/>
            attacked them while they were invading the territory of <lb/>
            Abydos, Alkibiades led them out to fight him, defeated <lb/>
            him, and, together with Thrasyllus, pursued him till night­ <lb/>
            fall. After this the soldiers fraternised with each other <lb/>
            and returned to their camp rejoicing together. On the <lb/>
            following day Alkibiades erected a trophy and ravaged <lb/>
            the country of Pharnabazus, no one daring to oppose him. <lb/>
            He even took priests and priestesses prisoners, but released <lb/>
            them without ransom.</p>
          <p>The city of Chalked on had revolted from Athens, and <lb/>
            received a Lacedæmonian harmost* and garrison. Alki­ <lb/>
            biades was eager to attack them, but, hearing that they <lb/>
            had collected all the property! in their country and placed <lb/>
            it in the hands of the Bithynians, a friendly tribe, he <lb/>
            led his whole army to the Bithynian frontier and sent a <lb/>
            herald to that people reproaching them for what they had <lb/>
            done. In terror, the Bithynians gave up the property to <lb/>
            him, and entered into an alliance with him.</p>
          <p>XXX. He now completely invested Chalkedon, by <note type="footnote"> * A “ harmost," <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρμοστὴς</foreign>, was an officer sent from Sparta to ad* <lb/>

            Duilding a wall reaching from sea to sea. Pharnabazus <lb/>
            came down to raise the siege, and Hippokrates, the harmost <lb/>
            of the city, led out his forces and attacked the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians at the same time. Alkibiades arranged his army <lb/>
            so as to be able to fight them both at once, forced Phar­ <lb/>
            nabazus to retreat with disgrace, killed Hippokrates, and <lb/>
            put his force to flight with severe loss. He now took <lb/>
            a cruise round the Hellespont, to raise contributions <lb/>
            from the towns on the coast, during which he took <lb/>
            Selymbria, where he, very unnecessarily, was exposed to <lb/>
            great personal risk. The party who intended to betray <lb/>
            the city had arranged to show a torch as a signal at <lb/>
            midnight, but were compelled to do so before the appointed <lb/>
            time, fearing one of the conspirators, who suddenly changed <lb/>
            his mind. When then the torch was raised, the army was <lb/>
            not ready for the assault, but Alkibiades, taking some <lb/>
            thirty men with him, ran at full speed up to the walls, <lb/>
            giving orders to the rest to follow. The city gate was <lb/>
            opened for him, and, twenty peltasts* having joined his <lb/>
            thirty soldiers, he entered, when he perceived the men of <lb/>
            Selymbria under arms marching down the street to meet <lb/>
            him. To await their onset would have been ruin, while <lb/>
            pride forbade a hitherto invincible general to retire. <lb/>
            Ordering his trumpet to sound, he bade one of those <lb/>
            present proclaim aloud that the Selymbrians ought not <lb/>
            to appear in arms against the Athenians. This speech <lb/>
            made some of the townspeople less eager to fight, as they <lb/>
            imagined that their enemies were all within the walls, <lb/>
            while it encouraged others who hoped to arrange matters <lb/>
            peaceably. While they were standing opposite to one <lb/>
            another and parleying, Alkibiades's army came up, and <lb/>
            he, truly conjecturing that the Selymbrians were really <lb/>
            disposed to be friendly, began to fear that his Thracian <lb/>
            troops might sack the city; for many of these barbarians <lb/>
            were serving in his army as volunteers, from a par­ <lb/>
            ticular attachment they had to his person. He there­ <note type="footnote"> * Peltaste were light-armed troops, so called because they carried <lb/>
            light round shields instead of the large unwieldy oblong shield of the <lb/>
            Hoplite, or heavy-armed infantry soldier. These light troops came <lb/>
            gradually into favour with the Greeks during the Peloponnesian war, <lb/>
            and afterwards became very extensively used. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="348"/>
            fore sent them all out of the city, and did not permit the <lb/>
            terrified people of Selymbria to suffer any violence, but, <lb/>
            having exacted a contribution of money and placed a <lb/>
            garrison in the town, he sailed away.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Meanwhile the generals who were besieging <lb/>
            Chalkedon made an agreement with Pharnabazus, on <lb/>
            these conditions. They were to receive a sum of money ; <lb/>
            the people of Chalkedon were to become subjects of Athens <lb/>
            as before; Pharnabazus was not to lay waste the province; <lb/>
            and he was to provide an escort and a safe-conduct for an <lb/>
            Athenian embassy to the Persian king. On the return of <lb/>
            Alkibiades, Pharnabazus desired him to swear to observe <lb/>
            these conditions, but Alkibiades refused to do so unless <lb/>
            Pharnabazus swore first. After this capitulation he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to Byzantium, which had revolted from Athens, <lb/>
            and built a wall round that city. Anaxilaus and Lykurgus, <lb/>
            with some others, now offered to betray the city if the <lb/>
            lives and property of the inhabitants were spared. Upon <lb/>
            this Alkibiades put about a report that his presence was <lb/>
            urgently required on the Ionian coast, and sailed away by <lb/>
            daylight with all his fleet. The same night he landed <lb/>
            with all his soldiers, and marched up to the walls in <lb/>
            silence, while the fleet, with a great clamour and disturb­ <lb/>
            ance, forced its way into the harbour. The suddenness of <lb/>
            this assault, entirely unexpected as it was, terrified the <lb/>
            people of Byzantium, and gave those of them who inclined <lb/>
            to the Athenian side an opportunity of admitting Alki­ <lb/>
            biades quietly, while the attention of every one was <lb/>
            directed to the ships in the harbour. The town did not, <lb/>
            however, surrender altogether without fighting; for the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians, Megarians, and Boeotians who were in it <lb/>
            drove the Athenians back into their ships with loss, and <lb/>
            when they heard that the land forces had entered the <lb/>
            town they formed in line and engaged them. A severe <lb/>
            battle took place, but Alkibiades on the right wing, and <lb/>
            Theramenes on the left, were at length victorious, and took <lb/>
            prisoners the survivors, some three hundred in number. <lb/>
            After this battle no citizen of Byzantium was either put <lb/>
            to death or banished, those being the terms on which the <lb/>
            conspirators had delivered up the city, namely, that they <lb/>
            should suffer no loss of life or property.</p><pb n="349"/>
            
          <p>Anaxilaus was afterwards tried at Sparta for having <lb/>
            betrayed the city, and justified what he had done, saying <lb/>
            that he was not a Lacedæmonian, but a Byzantine, and <lb/>
            that he saw Byzantium, not Sparta, in danger, as the city <lb/>
            was surrounded by the enemy's siege works, no provisions <lb/>
            being brought in to it, and what there was in it being <lb/>
            consumed by the Peloponnesians and Boeotians, while the <lb/>
            people of Byzantium with their wives and children were <lb/>
            starving. He did not, he said, betray the city to the <lb/>
            enemy, but relieved it from the miseries of war, imitating <lb/>
            therein the noblest Lacedæmonians, whose only idea of <lb/>
            what was noble and just was what would serve their <lb/>
            own country. The Lacedæmonians, on hearing this speech, <lb/>
            were ashamed to press the charge, and acquitted him.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Now, at length, Alkibiades began to wish to <lb/>
            see his native country again, and still more to be seen and <lb/>
            admired by his countrymen after his splendid series of <lb/>
            victories. He proceeded home with the Athenian fleet, <lb/>
            which was magnificently adorned with shields and trophies, <lb/>
            and had many prizes in tow, and the flags of many more <lb/>
            which he had captured and destroyed-all of them together <lb/>
            amounting to not less than two hundred. But we cannot <lb/>
            believe the additions which Douris the Samian, who says <lb/>
            that he is a descendant of Alkibiades, makes to this story, <lb/>
            to the effect that Chrysogonus, the victor at the Pythian <lb/>
            games, played on the flute to mark the time for the rowers, <lb/>
            while Kallipides the tragedian, attired in his buskins, <lb/>
            purple robe, and other theatrical properties, gave them <lb/>
            orders, and that the admiral's ship came into harbour with <lb/>
            purple sails, as if returning from a party of pleasure. <lb/>
            Neither Theopompus, nor Ephorus, nor Xenophon men­ <lb/>
            tions these circumstances, nor was it likely that he should <lb/>
            present himself before the Athenians in such a swaggering <lb/>
            fashion, when he was returning home from exile, after <lb/>
            having suffered such a variety of misfortunes. The truth <lb/>
            is, he sailed to Athens with considerable misgivings, and <lb/>
            on his arrival would not leave his ship until from her <lb/>
            deck he saw Euryptolemus his cousin, with many of his <lb/>
            friends and relatives, assembled to welcome him.</p>
          <p>When he landed, the people seemed to have no eyes <lb/>
            for the other generals, but all rushed towards him, and <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            escorted him on his way, cheering him, embracing him, <lb/>
            and crowning him with flowers. Those who could not <lb/>
            get near him gazed upon him from a distance, and the <lb/>
            older men pointed him out to the younger ones. Yet the <lb/>
            joy of the citizens was mingled with tears in the midst of <lb/>
            their rejoicings, when they thought of their past disasters, <lb/>
            for they reflected that they would not have failed in Sicily, <lb/>
            or met with any of their other terrible disappointments, if <lb/>
            they had not parted with Alkibiades when in the full tide of <lb/>
            prosperity. He had found Athens barely able to hold her <lb/>
            own at sea, by land mistress of little more than the ground <lb/>
            on which the city stood, and torn by internal strife; from <lb/>
            which miserable and forlorn condition he had restored her <lb/>
            so completely, that she was again not only omnipotent at <lb/>
            sea, but also victorious everywhere on land.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Before his return a decree had been passed <lb/>
            authorising him to do so, at the instance of Kritias, the <lb/>
            son of Kallæschrus, who himself alludes to it in his poems, <lb/>
            mentioning the service which he performed for Alkibiades <lb/>
            in the following verse: <lb/>
            “I moved your restoration by decree, <lb/>
            And that you're home again you owe to me.** <lb/>
            Immediately on the return of Alkibiades, the people <lb/>
            assembled in the Pnyx, where he addressed them. He <lb/>
            spoke with tears of his misfortunes, for which he partly <lb/>
            reproached his countrymen, though he attributed them <lb/>
            chiefly to his own unlucky fortune, and he greatly raised <lb/>
            their hopes by speaking encouragingly about their probable <lb/>
            successes in the future. He was honoured with golden <lb/>
            crowns, and elected sole general with absolute power <lb/>
            both by sea and land. A decree was also passed by which <lb/>
            his property was restored to him, and the Eumolpidæ and <lb/>
            Kerykes were ordered to retract the curses which they <lb/>
            had invoked upon him at the instance of the people. <lb/>
            When all the rest obeyed, Theodorus the hierophant <lb/>
            excused himself, saying, If he has done the State no wrong, <lb/>
            I never cursed him.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. While Alkibiades was in this glorious career <lb/>
            of prosperity, some persons in spite of his success foreboded <lb/>
            evil from the day which he had chosen for his return <lb/>
             <pb n="351"/>
            home ; for on the day on which he sailed into the harbour <lb/>
            the statue of Athene on the Acropolis is stripped of its <lb/>
            garments and ornaments, which are cleaned, while it in <lb/>
            the meanwhile is covered up to conceal it from human <lb/>
            eyes. This ceremony takes place on the 25th of the <lb/>
            month Thargelion, which day is considered by the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians to be the unluckiest of all. Moreover, the goddess <lb/>
            did not appear to receive Alkibiades with a kindly <lb/>
            welcome, but to turn away her face from him and drive <lb/>
            him from her presence. Be this as it may, all went well <lb/>
            and just as Alkibiades wished. A fleet of a hundred <lb/>
            triremes was manned, and placed at his disposal, but <lb/>
            he with creditable pride refused to set sail until after <lb/>
            the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries. Since the <lb/>
            permanent occupation of Dekeleia and of the passes <lb/>
            commanding the road to Eleusis by the enemy, the pro­ <lb/>
            cession had been necessarily shorn of many of its distinctive <lb/>
            features, as it had to be sent by sea. All the customary <lb/>
            sacrifices, dances, and other rites which used to be <lb/>
            practised on the road, when Iacchus is carried along in <lb/>
            solemn procession, were of necessity omitted. It seemed <lb/>
            therefore to Alkibiades that it would both honour the gods <lb/>
            and increase his own reputation among men, if he restored <lb/>
            the ancient form of this ceremony, escorting the procession <lb/>
            with his troops and protecting it from the enemy; for <lb/>
            he argued that Agis would lose prestige if he did not <lb/>
            attack, but allowed the procession to pass unmolested, <lb/>
            whereas if he did attack, Alkibiades would be able to <lb/>
            fight in a holy cause, in defence of the most sacred in­ <lb/>
            stitutions of his country, with all his countrymen present <lb/>
            as witnesses of his own valour. When he determined to <lb/>
            do this, after concerting measures with the Eumolpidæ and <lb/>
            Kerykes, he placed vedettes on the mountains and sent <lb/>
            an advanced guard off at day-break, following with the <lb/>
            priests, novices, and initiators marching in the midst-of <lb/>
            his army, in great good order and perfect silence. It was <lb/>
            an august and solemn procession, and all who did not <lb/>
            envy him said that he had performed the office of a high <lb/>
            priest in addition of that of a general. The enemy made no <lb/>
            attack, and he led his troops safely back to Athens, full <lb/>
            of pride himself, and making his army proud to think <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            itself invincible while under his command. He had so <lb/>
            won the affections of the poor and the lower orders, that <lb/>
            they were strangely desirous of living under his rule. <lb/>
            Many even besought him to put down the malignity of <lb/>
            his personal enemies, sweep away laws, decrees, and other <lb/>
            pernicious nonsense, and carry on the government without <lb/>
            fear of a factious opposition.</p>
          <p>XXXV. What his own views about making himself <lb/>
            despot of Athens may have been we cannot tell; but the <lb/>
            leading citizens took alarm at this, and hurried him away <lb/>
            as quickly as possible to sea, voting whatever measures he <lb/>
            pleased, and allowing him to choose his own colleagues. <lb/>
            He set sail with his hundred ships, reached Andros, and <lb/>
            defeated the inhabitants of that island, and the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian garrison there. He did not, however, capture the <lb/>
            city, and this afterwards became one of the points urged <lb/>
            against him by his enemies. Indeed, if there ever was a <lb/>
            man destroyed by his reputation, it was Alkibiades. Being <lb/>
            supposed to be such a prodigy of daring and subtlety, his <lb/>
            failures were regarded with suspicion, as if he could have <lb/>
            succeeded had he been in earnest; for his countrymen <lb/>
            would not believe that he could really fail in anything <lb/>
            which he seriously attempted. They expected to hear of <lb/>
            the capture of Chios, and of the whole Ionian coast, and <lb/>
            were vexed at not at once receiving the news of a complete <lb/>
            success. They did not take into account the want of <lb/>
            money which Alkibiades felt, while warring against men <lb/>
            who had the king of Persia for their paymaster, and which <lb/>
            made frequent absences from his camp necessary to provide <lb/>
            subsistence for his troops. It was one of these expeditions, <lb/>
            indeed, which exposed him to the last and most important of <lb/>
            the many charges brought against him. Lysander had been <lb/>
            sent by the Lacedæmonians to take the command of their <lb/>
            fleet. On his arrival, by means of the money paid by Cyrus, <lb/>
            he raised the pay of his sailors from three obols a day to <lb/>
            four. Alkibiades, who could with difficulty pay his men even <lb/>
            three obols, went to Caria to levy contributions, leaving in <lb/>
            command of the fleet one Antiochus, a good seaman, but <lb/>
            a thoughtless and silly man. He had distinct orders from <lb/>
            Alkibiades not to fight even if the enemy attacked him, <lb/>
            but such was his insolent disregard of these instructions <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            that he manned his own trireme and one other, sailed to <lb/>
            Ephesus, and there passed along the line of the enemy's <lb/>
            ships, as they lay on the beach, using the most scurrilous <lb/>
            and insulting language and gestures. At first Lysander <lb/>
            put to sea with a few ships to pursue him, but as the <lb/>
            Athenians came out to assist him, the action became <lb/>
            general. The entire fleets engaged and Lysander was <lb/>
            victorious. He killed Antiochus, captured many ships <lb/>
            and men, and set up a trophy. When Alkibiades on his <lb/>
            return to Samoa heard of this, he put to sea with all his <lb/>
            ships, and offered battle to Lysander; but he was satisfied <lb/>
            with his previous victory, and refused the offer.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Thrasybulus, the son of Thrason, a bitter <lb/>
            personal enemy of Alkibiades, now set sail for Athens to <lb/>
            accuse him, and to exasperate his enemies in the city <lb/>
            against him. He made a speech to the people, represent­ <lb/>
            ing that Alkibiades had ruined their affairs and lost their <lb/>
            ships by insolently abusing his authority and entrusting <lb/>
            the command, during his own absence, to men who <lb/>
            owed their influence with him to deep drinking and crack­ <lb/>
            ing seamen's jokes, and that he securely traversed the pro­ <lb/>
            vinces to raise money, indulging in drunken debauches <lb/>
            with Ionian courtezans, while the enemy's fleet was <lb/>
            riding close to his own. He was also blamed for the <lb/>
            construction of certain forts in Thrace, near Bisanthe, <lb/>
            which he destined as a place of refuge for himself, as if <lb/>
            he could not or would not live in his native city.</p>
          <p>The Athenians were so wrought upon by these charges <lb/>
            against Alkibiades, that they elected other generals to <lb/>
            supersede him, thus showing their anger and dislike for <lb/>
            him. Alkibiades, on learning this, left the Athenian <lb/>
            camp altogether, got together a force of foreign troops, <lb/>
            and made war on the irregular Thracian tribes on his <lb/>
            own account, thus obtaining much plunder and freeing <lb/>
            the neighbouring Greek cities from the dread of the bar­ <lb/>
            barians. Now when the generals Tydeus, Menander, <lb/>
            and Adeimantus came with the entire Athenian fleet to <lb/>
            Ægospotamoi, they used early every morning to go to <lb/>
            Lampsakus to challenge the fleet of Lysander, which lay <lb/>
            there, to a sea-fight. After this ceremony they would <lb/>
            return and spend the whole day in careless indolence, as <note type="footnote"> 2 A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            if despising their enemy. Alkibiades, who lived close by, <lb/>
            did not disregard their danger, but even rode over on <lb/>
            horseback and pointed out to the generals that they were <lb/>
            very badly quartered in a place where there was no <lb/>
            harbour and no city, having to obtain all their provisions <lb/>
            from Sestos, and, when the ships were once hauled up on <lb/>
            shore, allowing the men to leave them unguarded and <lb/>
            straggle where they pleased, although they were in the <lb/>
            presence of a fleet which was trained to act in silence and <lb/>
            good order at the command of one man.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Though Alkibiades gave this advice, and <lb/>
            urged the generals to remove to Sestos, they would not <lb/>
            listen to him. Tydeus indeed rudely bade him begone. <lb/>
            for they, not he, were now generals. Alkibiades, too, <lb/>
            suspected that there was some treachery in the case, and <lb/>
            retired, telling his personal friends, who escorted him out <lb/>
            of the camp, that if he had not been so outrageously <lb/>
            insulted by the generals, he could in a few days have <lb/>
            compelled the Lacedæmonians either to fight a battle at <lb/>
            sea against their will, or abandon their ships. To some <lb/>
            this seemed mere boasting, while others thought that he <lb/>
            could very possibly effect it by bringing many Thracian <lb/>
            light-armed troops and cavalry to assault the camp on the <lb/>
            land side. However, the result soon proved that he had <lb/>
            rightly seen the fault of the Athenian position. Lysander <lb/>
            suddenly and unexpectedly assailed it, and except eight <lb/>
            triremes which escaped under Konon, took all the rest, <lb/>
            nearly two hundred in number. Lysander also put three <lb/>
            thousand prisoners to the sword. He shortly afterwards <lb/>
            captured Athens, burned her ships, and pulled down her <lb/>
            Long Walls. Alkibiades, terrified at seeing the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians omnipotent by sea and land, shifted his <lb/>
            quarters to Bithynia, sending thither a great amount of <lb/>
            treasure, and taking much with him, but leaving much <lb/>
            more in his Thracian fortresses. In Bithynia, however, <lb/>
            he suffered much loss at the hands of the natives, and <lb/>
            determined to proceed to the court of Artaxerxes, thinking <lb/>
            that the Persian king, if he would make trial of him, <lb/>
            would find that he was not inferior to Themistokles in <lb/>
            ability, while he sought him in a much more honourable <lb/>
            way; for it was not to revenge himself on his fellow. <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            citizens, as Themistokles did, but to assist his own conntry <lb/>
            against its enemy that he meant to solicit the king's aid. <lb/>
            Imagining that Pharnabazus would be able to grant him <lb/>
            a safe passage to the Persian court, he went into Phrygia <lb/>
            to meet him, and remained there for some time, paying <lb/>
            his court to the satrap, and receiving from him marks of <lb/>
            respect.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. The Athenians were terribly cast down at <lb/>
            the loss of their empire ; but when Lysander robbed them <lb/>
            of their liberty as well, by establishing the government <lb/>
            of the Thirty Tyrants, they began to entertain thoughts <lb/>
            which never had occurred to them before, while it was <lb/>
            yet possible that the State might be saved from ruin. <lb/>
            They bewailed their past blunders and mistakes, and <lb/>
            of these they considered their second fit of passion with <lb/>
            Alkibiades to have been the greatest. They had cast <lb/>
            him off for no fault of his own, but merely because they <lb/>
            were angry with his follower for having lost a few ships <lb/>
            disgracefully; they had much more disgraced themselves <lb/>
            by losing the services of the ablest and bravest general <lb/>
            whom they possessed. Even in their present abasement <lb/>
            a vague hope prevailed among them that Athens could <lb/>
            not be utterly lost while Alkibiades was alive; for he <lb/>
            had not during his former exile been satisfied with <lb/>
            a quiet life, and surely now, however prosperous his <lb/>
            private circumstances might be, he would not endure to <lb/>
            see the triumph of the Lacedæmonians, and the arrogant <lb/>
            tyranny of the Thirty. Indeed this was proved to be <lb/>
            no vain dream by the care which the Thirty took to <lb/>
            watch all the motions of Alkibiades. At last, Kritias <lb/>
            informed Lysander, that while Athens was governed by <lb/>
            a democracy, the Lacedæmonian empire in Greece could <lb/>
            never be safe; and if the Athenians were ever so much <lb/>
            inclined to an oligarchical form of government, Alkibiades, <lb/>
            if he lived, would not long suffer them to submit to it. <lb/>
            However, Lysander was not prevailed upon by these <lb/>
            arguments until a despatch came from Sparta bidding him <lb/>
            make away with Alkibiades, either because the home <lb/>
            government feared his ability and enterprise, or because <lb/>
            they wished to please his enemy, King Agis.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Lysander now sent orders for his death to <note type="footnote"> 2 A 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            Pharnabazus, who entrusted their execution to his brother <lb/>
            Magæus and his uncle Susamithres. Alkibiades was at <lb/>
            this time dwelling in a village in Phrygia, with Ti­ <lb/>
            mandra the courtezan, and one night he dreamed that <lb/>
            he was dressed in his mistress's clothes, and that she, <lb/>
            holding his head in her arms, was painting his face and <lb/>
            adorning him like a woman. Others say that he saw <lb/>
            Magæus in his dream cutting off his head, and his body <lb/>
            all in flames. All, however, agree that the dream took <lb/>
            place shortly before his death. His murderers did not <lb/>
            dare to enter the house, but stood round it in a circle and <lb/>
            set it on fire. Alkibiades, on discovering them, flung most <lb/>
            of the bedding and clothes on to the fire, wrapped his <lb/>
            cloak round his left arm, and with his dagger in his right <lb/>
            dashed through the flames unhurt, not giving his clothes <lb/>
            time to catch fire. None of the barbarians dared to await <lb/>
            his onset, but as soon as they saw him they scattered, and <lb/>
            from a distance shot at him with darts and arrows. After <lb/>
            he had fallen and the barbarians were gone, Timandra <lb/>
            took up his corpse, covered it with her own clothes, and, <lb/>
            as far as was in her power, showed it every mark of <lb/>
            honour and respect.</p>
          <p>This Timandra is said to have been the mother of Lais, <lb/>
            commonly called the Corinthian, who really was brought <lb/>
            as a captive from Hykkara, a small town in Sicily. <lb/>
            Some writers, although they agree in their account of the <lb/>
            manner of his death, differ as to its cause, alleging that it <lb/>
            was neither clue to Pharnabazus nor to Lysander nor the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians, but that Alkibiades had debauched a <lb/>
            girl of noble birth and was living with her, and that her <lb/>
            relatives, enraged at this insult, during the night set fire <lb/>
            to the house in which Alkibiades was living, and, as has <lb/>
            been related, shot him as he leaped out through the flames.</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. THE patrician family of the Marcii at Rome produced <lb/>
            many illustrious men, amongst whom was Ancus Marcius, <lb/>
            the grandson of Numa, who became king after the death <lb/>
            of Tullus Hostilius. To this family also belonged Publius <lb/>
            and Quintus Marcius, who supplied Rome with abundance <lb/>
            of excellent water, and Censorinus, twice appointed censor <lb/>
            by the Roman people, who afterwards passed a law that <lb/>
            no one should hold that office twice.</p>
          <p>Caius Marcius, the subject of this memoir, was an <lb/>
            orphan, and brought up by a widowed mother. He proved <lb/>
            that, hard though the lot of an orphan may be, yet it does <lb/>
            not prevent a man's becoming great and distinguished, <lb/>
            and that the bad alone allege it as an excuse for an <lb/>
            intemperate life. He also proves to us that a naturally <lb/>
            noble nature, if it be not properly disciplined, will produce <lb/>
            many good and bad qualities together, just as a rich field, <lb/>
            if not properly tilled, will produce both weeds and good <lb/>
            fruit. The immense energy and courage of his mind used <lb/>
            to urge him to attempt and to perform great exploits, but <lb/>
            his harsh and ambitious temper made it difficult for him <lb/>
            to live on friendly terms with his companions. They <lb/>
            used to admire his indifference to pleasure and pain, and <lb/>
            his contempt for bribes, but in politics they were angered <lb/>
            by his morose and haughty manner, too proud for a citizen <lb/>
            of a republic. Indeed there is no advantage to be gained <lb/>
            from a liberal education so great as that of softening and <lb/>
            disciplining the natural ferocity of our disposition, by <lb/>
            teaching it moderation, and how to avoid all extremes. <lb/>
            However, at that period warlike virtues were valued above <lb/>
            all others at Rome, which is proved by the Romans pos­ <lb/>
            sessing only one word for virtue and for bravery, so that <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            virtue, a general term, is applied by them to the particular <lb/>
            form, courage.</p>
          <p>II. Marcius, having an especial passion for war, was <lb/>
            familiar from childhood with the use of arms. Reflecting <lb/>
            that artificial weapons are of little use without a body <lb/>
            capable of wielding them, he so trained himself for all <lb/>
            possible emergencies that he was both able to run swiftly <lb/>
            and also to grapple with his foe so strongly that few <lb/>
            could escape from him. Those who entered into any <lb/>
            contest with him, when beaten, used to ascribe their <lb/>
            defeat to his immense bodily strength, which no exertions <lb/>
            could tire out.</p>
          <p>III. He served his first campaign while yet a youth, <lb/>
            when Tarquin, the exiled King of Rome, after many <lb/>
            battles and defeats, staked all upon one last throw, and <lb/>
            assembled an army to attack Rome. His force consisted <lb/>
            chiefly of Latins, but many other Italian states took his <lb/>
            part in the war, not from any attachment to his person, <lb/>
            but through fear and dislike of the growing power of <lb/>
            Rome. In the battle which ensued, in which various <lb/>
            turns of fortune took place, Marcius, while fighting <lb/>
            bravely under the eye of the dictator himself, saw a <lb/>
            Roman fallen and helpless near him. He at once made <lb/>
            for this man, stood in front of him, and killed his assailant. <lb/>
            After the victory, Marcius was among the first who re­ <lb/>
            ceived the oak-leaf crown. This crown is given to him <lb/>
            who has saved the life of a citizen in battle, and is <lb/>
            composed of oak-leaves, either out of compliment to the <lb/>
            Arcadians, whom the oracle calls ‘ acorn eaters,' or because <lb/>
            in any campaign in any country it is easy to obtain oak­ <lb/>
            boughs, or it may be that the oak, sacred to Jupiter the <lb/>
            protector of cities, forms a suitable crown for one who <lb/>
            has saved the life of a citizen. The oak is the most <lb/>
            beautiful of all wild trees, and the strongest of those <lb/>
            which are artificially cultivated. It afforded men in early <lb/>
            times both food and drink, by its acorns and the honey <lb/>
            found in it, while by the bird-lime which it produces, it <lb/>
            enables them to catch most kinds of birds and other <lb/>
            creatures, as additional dainties.</p>
          <p>This was the battle in which they say that the Dioscuri, <lb/>
            Castor and Pollux, appeared, and immediately after the <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            battle were seen in the Forum at Rome announcing the <lb/>
            victory, with their horses dripping with sweat, at the spot <lb/>
            where now there is a temple built in their honour beside <lb/>
            the fountain. In memory of this, the day of the victory, <lb/>
            the 15th of July, is kept sacred to the Dioscuri.</p>
          <p>IV. To win distinction early in life is said to quench <lb/>
            and satisfy the eagerness of some men whose desire for <lb/>
            glory is not keen; but for those with whom it is the <lb/>
            ruling passion of their lives, the gaining of honours only <lb/>
            urges them on, as a ship is urged by a gale, to fresh <lb/>
            achievements. They do not regard themselves as having <lb/>
            received a reward, but as having given a pledge for the <lb/>
            future, and they feel it their duty not to disgrace the <lb/>
            reputation which they have acquired, but to eclipse their <lb/>
            former fame by some new deed of prowess. Marcius, feel­ <lb/>
            ing this, was ever trying to surpass himself in valour, and <lb/>
            gained such prizes and trophies that the later generals under <lb/>
            whom he served were always striving to outdo the former <lb/>
            ones in their expressions of esteem for him, and their <lb/>
            testimony to his merits. Many as were the wars in which <lb/>
            Rome was then engaged, Marcius never returned from <lb/>
            any without a prize for valour or some especial mark of <lb/>
            distinction. Other men were brave in order to win glory, <lb/>
            but Marcius won glory in order to please his mother. That <lb/>
            she should hear him praised, see him crowned, and embrace <lb/>
            him weeping for joy, was the greatest honour and happi­ <lb/>
            ness of his life. Epameinondas is said to have had the <lb/>
            same feelings, and to have considered it to be his greatest <lb/>
            good-fortune that his father and mother were both alive <lb/>
            to witness his triumphant success at the battle of Leuktra. <lb/>
            He, however, enjoyed the sympathy and applause of both <lb/>
            parents, but Marcius, being fatherless, lavished on his <lb/>
            mother all that affection which should have belonged to <lb/>
            his father, besides her own share. So boundless was his <lb/>
            love for Volumnia that at her earnest desire he even <lb/>
            married a wife, but still continued to live in the house of <lb/>
            his mother.</p>
          <p>V. At this time, when his reputation and influence were <lb/>
            very considerable because of his prowess, there was a <lb/>
            party-quarrel going on in Rome between the patricians, <lb/>
            who wished to defend the privileges of men of property, <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            and the people, who were suffering terrible ill-treatment <lb/>
            at the hands of their creditors. Those who possessed a <lb/>
            small property were forced either to pledge or to sell it, <lb/>
            while those who were absolutely destitute were carried off <lb/>
            and imprisoned, though they might be scarred and en­ <lb/>
            feebled from the wars in which they had served in defence <lb/>
            of their country. The last campaign was that against the <lb/>
            Sabines, after which their rich creditors promised to treat <lb/>
            them with less harshness. In pursuance of a decree of the <lb/>
            Senate, Marcus Valerius the consul was the guarantee of <lb/>
            this promise. But when, after serving manfully in this <lb/>
            campaign and conquering the enemy, they met with no <lb/>
            better treatment from their creditors, and the Senate seemed <lb/>
            unmindful of its engagements, allowing them to be im­ <lb/>
            prisoned and distresses to be levied upon their property as <lb/>
            before, there were violent outbreaks and riots in the city. <lb/>
            This disturbed condition of the commonwealth was taken <lb/>
            advantage of by the enemy, who invaded the country and <lb/>
            plundered it. When the consuls called all men of military <lb/>
            age to arms, no one obeyed, and then at last the patricians <lb/>
            hesitated. Some thought that they ought to yield to the <lb/>
            lower classes, and make some concessions instead of enforcing <lb/>
            the strict letter of the law against them;. while others, <lb/>
            among whom was Marcius, opposed this idea, not because <lb/>
            he thought the money of great consequence, but because <lb/>
            he considered this to be the beginning of an outburst of <lb/>
            democratic insolence which a wise government would take <lb/>
            timely measures to suppress before it gathered strength.</p>
          <p>VI. As the Senate, although it frequently met, came <lb/>
            to no decision on this matter, the plebeians suddenly <lb/>
            assembled in a body, left the city, and established them­ <lb/>
            selves on what was afterwards called the Mons Sacer, or <lb/>
            Sacred Hill, near the river Anio. They abstained from <lb/>
            all factious proceedings, and merely stated that they had <lb/>
            been driven from the city by the wealthy classes. Air <lb/>
            and water and a place in which to be buried, they said, <lb/>
            could be obtained anywhere in Italy, and they could get <lb/>
            nothing more than this in Rome, except the privilege of <lb/>
            being wounded or slain in fighting battles on behalf of the <lb/>
            rich. At this demonstration, the Senate became alarmed, <lb/>
            and sent the most moderate and popular of its members <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            to treat with the people. The spokesman of this embassy <lb/>
            was Menenius Agrippa, who, after begging the plebeians <lb/>
            to come to terms, and pleading the cause of the Senate <lb/>
            with them, wound up his speech by the following fable: <lb/>
            Once upon a time, said he, all the members revolted <lb/>
            against the belly, reproaching it with lying idle in the <lb/>
            body, and making all the other members work in order <lb/>
            to provide it with food; but the belly laughed them to <lb/>
            scorn, saying that it was quite true that it took all the <lb/>
            food which the body obtained, but that it afterwards <lb/>
            distributed it among all the members. “This,” he said, <lb/>
            “ is the part played by the Senate in the body pi litic. It <lb/>
            digests and arranges all the affairs of the State, and <lb/>
            provides all of you with wholesome and useful measures."</p>
          <p>VII. Upon this they came to terms, after stipulating <lb/>
            that five men should be chosen to defend the cause of the <lb/>
            people, who are now known as tribunes of the people. <lb/>
            They chose for the first tribunes the leaders of the revolt, <lb/>
            the chief of whom were Junius Brutus and Sicinius <lb/>
            Vellutus. As soon as the State was one again, the people <lb/>
            assembled under arms, and zealously offered their services <lb/>
            for war to their rulers. Marcius, though but little pleased <lb/>
            with these concessions which the plebeians had wrung from <lb/>
            the patricians, yet, noticing that many patricians were of <lb/>
            his mind, called upon them not to be outdone in patriotism <lb/>
            by the plebeians, but to prove themselves their superiors <lb/>
            in valour rather than in political strength.</p>
          <p>VIII. Corioli was the most important city of the Volscian <lb/>
            nation, with which Rome then was at war. The consul <lb/>
            Cominius was besieging it, and the Volscians, fearing it <lb/>
            might be taken, gathered from all quarters, meaning to <lb/>
            fight a battle under the city walls, and so place the <lb/>
            Romans between two fires. Cominius divided his army, <lb/>
            and led one part of it to fight the relieving force, leaving <lb/>
            Titus Lartius, a man of the noblest birth in Rome, to <lb/>
            continue the siege with the rest of his troops. The <lb/>
            garrison of Corioli, despising the small numbers of their <lb/>
            besiegers, attacked them and forced them to take shelter <lb/>
            within their camp. But there Marcius with a few <lb/>
            followers checked their onset, slew the foremost, and <lb/>
            with a loud voice called on the Romans to rally, lie <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            was, as Cato said a soldier should be, not merely able to <lb/>
            deal weighty blows, but struck terror into his enemies <lb/>
            by the loud tones of his voice and his martial appearance, <lb/>
            so that few dared to stand their ground before him. Many <lb/>
            soldiers rallied round him and forced the enemy to <lb/>
            retreat; but he, not satisfied with this, followed them <lb/>
            close and drove them in headlong flight back to the city. <lb/>
            On arriving there, although he saw that the Romans <lb/>
            were slackening their pursuit as many missiles were <lb/>
            aimed at them from the city walls, and none of them <lb/>
            thought of daring to enter together with the fugitives into <lb/>
            a city full of armed men, yet he stood and cheered them <lb/>
            on, loudly telling them that fortune had opened the city <lb/>
            gates as much to the pursuers as to the pursued. Few <lb/>
            cared to follow him, but he, forcing his way through the <lb/>
            crowd of fugitives, entered the city with them, none daring <lb/>
            at first to withstand him. Soon, when the enemy saw <lb/>
            how few of the Romans were within the gates, they <lb/>
            rallied and attacked them. Marcius, in the confused <lb/>
            mass of friends and foes, fought with incredible strength, <lb/>
            swiftness, and courage, overthrowing all whom he at­ <lb/>
            tacked, driving some to the further parts of the town, <lb/>
            and forcing others to lay down their arms, so that Lartius <lb/>
            was able to march the rest of the Roman army into the <lb/>
            gates unmolested.</p>
          <p>IX. When the city was taken, the greater part of the <lb/>
            soldiers fell to plundering it, which greatly vexed Marcius. <lb/>
            He loudly exclaimed that it was a disgraceful thing, when <lb/>
            the consul was on the point of engaging with the enemy, <lb/>
            that they should be plundering, or, on the pretext of <lb/>
            plunder, keeping themselves safe out of harm's way. Few <lb/>
            paid any attention to him, but with those few he marched <lb/>
            on the track of the main body, frequently encouraging <lb/>
            his followers to greater speed, and not to give way to <lb/>
            fatigue, and frequently praying to Heaven that he might <lb/>
            not come too late for the battle, but arrive in time to share <lb/>
            the labours and perils of his countrymen. There was at <lb/>
            that time a custom among the Romans, when they were <lb/>
            drawn up in order of battle, ready to take their shields in <lb/>
            their hands, and to gird themselves with the trabea, to <lb/>
            make their will verbally, naming their heir in the presence <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            of three or four witnesses. The Roman army was found <lb/>
            by Marcius in the act of performing this ceremony. At <lb/>
            first some were alarmed at seeing him appear with only a <lb/>
            few followers, covered with blood and sweat; but when <lb/>
            he ran joyously up to the consul and told him that Corioli <lb/>
            was taken, Cuminius embraced him, and all the ranks <lb/>
            took fresh courage, some because they heard, and others <lb/>
            because they guessed the glorious news. They eagerly <lb/>
            demanded to be led to battle. Marcius now enquired of <lb/>
            Cominius how the enemy's line of battle was arranged, <lb/>
            and where it was strongest. When the consul answered <lb/>
            that he believed that the men of Antium, the proudest and <lb/>
            bravest troops of the Volscians, were posted in the centre, <lb/>
            he answered, “ I beg of you, place us opposite to those <lb/>
            men." The consul, filled with admiration for his spirit, <lb/>
            placed him there. As soon as the armies met, Marcius <lb/>
            charged before the rest, and the Volscians gave way before <lb/>
            his onset. The centre, where he attacked, was quite broken, <lb/>
            but the ranks on either side wheeled round and sur­ <lb/>
            rounded him, so that the consul feared for his safety, and <lb/>
            despatched the choicest of his own troops to his aid. They <lb/>
            found a hot battle raging round Marcius, and many slain, <lb/>
            but by the shock of their charge they drove off the enemy <lb/>
            in confusion. As they began to pursue them, they <lb/>
            begged Marcius, now weary with toil and wounds, to <lb/>
            retire to the camp, but he, saying that "it was Dot for <lb/>
            victors to be weary," joined in the pursuit. The rest of <lb/>
            the Volscian army was defeated, many were slain, and <lb/>
            many taken.</p>
          <p>X. On the next day Lartius and the rest joined the <lb/>
            consul. He ascended a rostrum, and after returning <lb/>
            suitable thanks to Heaven for such unexampled successes, <lb/>
            turned to Marcius. First he praised his conduct in the <lb/>
            highest terms, having himself witnessed some part of it, <lb/>
            and having learned the rest from Lartius. Next, as there <lb/>
            were many prisoners, horses, and other spoil, he bade him, <lb/>
            before it was divided, choose a tenth part for himself. <lb/>
            He also presented him with a horse and trappings, as a <lb/>
            reward for his bravery. As all the Romans murmured <lb/>
            their approval, Marcius coming forward said that he gladly <lb/>
            accepted the horse, and was thankful for the praise which <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            he had received from the consul. As for the rest, he <lb/>
            considered that to be mere pay, not a prize, and refused <lb/>
            it, preferring to take his share with the rest. " One <lb/>
            especial favour," said he, "I do beg of you. I had a <lb/>
            friend among the Volscians, who now is a captive, and <lb/>
            from having been a rich and free man has fallen to the con­ <lb/>
            dition of a slave. I wish to relieve him from one of his <lb/>
            many misfortunes-that of losing his liberty and being <lb/>
            sold for a slave." After these words, Marcius was cheered <lb/>
            more than he had been before, and men admired his dis­ <lb/>
            interestedness more than they had admired his bravery. <lb/>
            Even those who grudged him his extraordinary honours <lb/>
            now thought that by his unselfishness he had shown <lb/>
            himself worthy of them, and admired his courage in <lb/>
            refusing such presents more than the courage by which <lb/>
            he had won the right to them. Indeed, the right use of <lb/>
            riches is more glorious than that of arms, but not to <lb/>
            desire them at all is better even than using them well.</p>
          <p>XI. When the cheering caused by Marcius’ s speech had <lb/>
            subsided, Cominius said: " Fellow soldiers, we cannot <lb/>
            force a man against his will to receive these presents; but, <lb/>
            unless his achievements have already won it for him, let <lb/>
            us give him the title of Coriolanus, which he cannot <lb/>
            refuse, seeing for what it is bestowed, and let us confirm <lb/>
            it by a general vote."</p>
          <p>Hence he obtained the third name of Coriolanus. <lb/>
            From this we may clearly see that his own personal name <lb/>
            was Caius, and that Marcius was the common name of his <lb/>
            family, while the third name was added afterwards to <lb/>
            mark some particular exploit, peculiarity, or virtue in the <lb/>
            bearer. So also did the Greeks in former ages give men <lb/>
            names derived from their actions, such as Kallinikus (the <lb/>
            Vietor), or Soter (the Preserver); or from their appearance, <lb/>
            as Fusco (the Fat), or Gripus the Hook-nosed); or from their <lb/>
            virtues, as Euergetes (the Benefactor), or Philadelphus ( the <lb/>
            Lover of his Brethren), which were names of the Ptolemies: <lb/>
            or from their success, as Eudæmon (the Fortunate), a name <lb/>
            given to the second king of the race of Battus. Some <lb/>
            princes have even had names given them in jest, as <lb/>
            Antigonus was called Boson (the Promiser), and Ptolemy <lb/>
            Lathyrus (the Vetch).</p><pb n="365"/>
            
          <p>The Romans used this sort of name much more com­ <lb/>
            monly, as for instance they named one of the Metelli <lb/>
            Diadematus, or wearer of the diadem, because he walked <lb/>
            about for a long time with his head bound up because of <lb/>
            a wound in the forehead.</p>
          <p>Another of the same family was named Celer (the Swift), <lb/>
            because of the wonderful quickness with which he pro­ <lb/>
            vided a show of gladiators on the occasion of his father's <lb/>
            funeral. Some even to the present day derive their names <lb/>
            from the circumstances of their birth, as for instance a <lb/>
            child is named Proculus if his father be abroad when he <lb/>
            is born, and Postumus if he be dead. If one of twins <lb/>
            survive, he is named Vopiscus. Of names taken from <lb/>
            bodily peculiarities they use not only Sulla (the Pimply), <lb/>
            Niger (the Swarthy), Rufus (the Red-haired), but even <lb/>
            such as Cæcus (the Blind), and Claudus (the Lame), <lb/>
            wisely endeavouring to accustom men to consider neither <lb/>
            blindness nor any other bodily defect to be any disgrace <lb/>
            or matter of reproach, but to answer to these names as if <lb/>
            they were their own. However, this belongs to a different <lb/>
            branch of study.</p>
          <p>XII. When the war was over, the popular orators <lb/>
            renewed the party-quarrels, not that they had any new <lb/>
            cause of complaint or any just grievance to proceed upon ; <lb/>
            but the evil result which had necessarily been produced <lb/>
            by their former riotous contests were now made the ground <lb/>
            of attacks on the patricians. A great part of the country <lb/>
            was left unsown and untilled, while the war gave no <lb/>
            opportunities for importation from other countries. The <lb/>
            demagogues, therefore, seeing that there was no corn in <lb/>
            the market, and that even if there had been any, the <lb/>
            people were not able to buy it, spread malicious accusa­ <lb/>
            tions against the rich, saying that they had purposely <lb/>
            produced this famine in order to pay off an old grudge <lb/>
            against the people. At this juncture ambassadors arrived <lb/>
            from the town of Velitræ, who delivered up their city to <lb/>
            the Romans, desiring that they would send some new <lb/>
            inhabitants to people it, as a pestilence had made such <lb/>
            havoc among the citizens that there was scarcely a tenth <lb/>
            part of them remaining alive.</p>
          <p>The wiser Romans thought that this demand of the <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            people of Velitræ would confer a most seasonable relief <lb/>
            on themselves, and would put an end to their domestic <lb/>
            troubles, if they could only transfer the more violent <lb/>
            partizans of the popular party thither, and so purge the <lb/>
            State of its more disorderly elements. The consuls <lb/>
            accordingly chose out all these men and sent them to <lb/>
            colonize Velitræ, and enrolled the rest for a campaign <lb/>
            against the Volsci, that they might not have leisure for <lb/>
            revolutionary plottings, but that when they were all <lb/>
            gathered together, rich and poor, patrician and plebeian <lb/>
            alike, to share in the common dangers of a camp, they <lb/>
            might learn to regard one another with less hatred and <lb/>
            ill will.</p>
          <p>XIII. But Sicinnius and Brutus, the tribunes of the <lb/>
            people, now interposed, crying aloud that the consuls were <lb/>
            veiling a most barbarous action under the specious name <lb/>
            of sending out colonists. They were despatching many­ <lb/>
            poor men to certain destruction by transporting them to a <lb/>
            city whose air was full of pestilence and the stench from <lb/>
            unburied corpses, where they were to dwell under the <lb/>
            auspices of a god who was not only not their own, but <lb/>
            angry with them. And after that, as if it was not <lb/>
            sufficient for them that some of the citizens should be <lb/>
            starved, and others be exposed to the plague, they must <lb/>
            needs plunge wantonly into war, in order that the city <lb/>
            might suffer every conceivable misery at once, because it <lb/>
            had refused any longer to remain in slavery to the rich. <lb/>
            Excited by these speeches, the people would not enrol <lb/>
            themselves as soldiers for the war, and looked with <lb/>
            suspicion on the proposal for the new colony. The Senate <lb/>
            was greatly perplexed, but Marcius, now a person of great <lb/>
            importance and very highly thought of in the State, <lb/>
            began to place himself in direct opposition to the popular <lb/>
            leaders, and to support the patrician cause. In spite of <lb/>
            the efforts of the demagogues, a colony was sent out to <lb/>
            Velitræ, those whose names were drawn by lot being <lb/>
            compelled by heavy penalties to go thither; but as the <lb/>
            people utterly refused to serve in the campaign against <lb/>
            the Volscians, Marcius made up a troop of his own clients, <lb/>
            with which and what others he could persuade to join him <lb/>
            he made an inroad into the territory of Antium. Here he <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            found much corn, and captured many prisoners and much <lb/>
            cattle. He kept none of it for himself, but returned to <lb/>
            Rome with his troops loaded with plunder. This caused <lb/>
            the others to repent of their determination, when they <lb/>
            saw the wealth which these men had obtained, but it <lb/>
            embittered their hatred of Marcius, whom they regarded <lb/>
            as gaining glory for himself at the expense of the people.</p>
          <p>XIV. Shortly after this, however, Marcius stood for the <lb/>
            consulship, and then the people relented and felt ashamed <lb/>
            to affront such a man, first in arms as in place, and the <lb/>
            author of so many benefits to the State. It was the <lb/>
            custom at Rome for those who were candidates for any <lb/>
            office to address and ingratiate themselves with the people, <lb/>
            going about the Forum in a toga without any tunic under­ <lb/>
            neath it, either in order to show their humility by such <lb/>
            a dress, or else in order to display the wounds which they <lb/>
            had received, in token of their valour. At that early <lb/>
            period there could be no suspicion of bribery, and it was <lb/>
            not for that reason that the citizens wished their candidates <lb/>
            to come down among them ungirt and without a tunic. <lb/>
            It was not till long afterwards that votes were bought <lb/>
            and sold, and that a candidature became an affair of money. <lb/>
            This habit of receiving bribes, when once introduced, <lb/>
            spread to the courts of justice and to the armies of the <lb/>
            commonwealth, and finally brought the city under the <lb/>
            despotic rule of the emperors, as the power of arms was <lb/>
            not equal to that of money. For it was well said that he <lb/>
            who first introduced the habit of feasting and bribing <lb/>
            voters ruined the constitution. This plague crept secretly <lb/>
            and silently into Home, and was for a long time undis­ <lb/>
            covered. We cannot tell who was the first to bribe the <lb/>
            people or the courts of law at Rome. At Athens it is said <lb/>
            that the first man who gave money to the judges for his <lb/>
            acquittal was Anytus the son of Anthemion, when he <lb/>
            was tried for treachery at Pylos towards the end of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian War, a period when men of uncorrupted <lb/>
            simplicity and virtue were still to be found in the Forum <lb/>
            at Rome.</p>
          <p>XV. Marcius displayed many scars, gained in the <lb/>
            numerous battles in which for seventeen years in succes­ <lb/>
            sion he had always taken a prominent part. The people <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            were abashed at these evidences of his valour, and agreed <lb/>
            among themselves that they would return him as consul. <lb/>
            But when, on the day of election, he appeared in the <lb/>
            Forum, escorted by a splendid procession of the entire <lb/>
            Senate, and all the patricians were seen collected round <lb/>
            him evidently intent upon obtaining his election, many <lb/>
            of the people lost their feeling of goodwill towards him, <lb/>
            and regarded him with indignation and envy; which <lb/>
            passions were assisted by their fear lest, if a man of such <lb/>
            aristocratic tendencies and such influence with the patri­ <lb/>
            cians should obtain power, he might altogether destroy <lb/>
            the liberties of the people. For these reasons they did <lb/>
            not elect Marcius. When two persons had been elected <lb/>
            consuls, the Senate was much irritated, considering that <lb/>
            it, rather than its candidate Marcius, had been insulted, <lb/>
            while he was much enraged, and could not bear his <lb/>
            disgrace with any temper or patience, being accustomed <lb/>
            always to yield to the more violent and ferocious emotions <lb/>
            as being the more spirited course, without any mixture <lb/>
            of gravity and self-restraint, virtues so necessary for <lb/>
            political life. He had never learned how essential it is <lb/>
            for one who undertakes to deal with men, and engage in <lb/>
            public business, to avoid above all things that self-will <lb/>
            which, as Plato says, is of the family of solitude, and to <lb/>
            become longsuffering and patient, qualities which some <lb/>
            foolish people hold very cheap. Marcius, plain and <lb/>
            straightforward, thinking it to be the duty of a brave <lb/>
            man to bear down all opposition, and not reflecting that <lb/>
            it is rather a sign of weakness and feebleness of mind to <lb/>
            be unable to restrain one's passion, flung away in a rage, <lb/>
            bitterly irritated against the people. The young aris­ <lb/>
            tocracy of Rome, who had ever been his fast friends, now <lb/>
            did him an ill service by encouraging and exasperating <lb/>
            his anger by their expressions of sympathy; for he was <lb/>
            their favourite leader and a most kind instructor in the <lb/>
            art of war when on a campaign, as he taught them to <lb/>
            delight in deeds of prowess without envying aid grudging <lb/>
            one another their proper meed of praise.</p>
          <p>XVI. While this was the state of affairs at Rome, a <lb/>
            large amount of corn arrived there, some of which had <lb/>
            been bought in Italy, but most of it sent ap a present <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            from Sicily by Gelon the despot; which gave most men <lb/>
            hopes that the famine would come to an end, and that <lb/>
            the quarrel between the patricians and plebeians would, <lb/>
            under these improved circumstances, be made up. The <lb/>
            Senate at once assembled, and the people eagerly waited <lb/>
            outside the doors of the senate house, expecting and <lb/>
            hoping that prices would be lowered, and that the present <lb/>
            of corn would be distributed gratis among them; and <lb/>
            indeed some of the senators advised the adoption of that <lb/>
            course. Marcius, however, rose and bitterly inveighed <lb/>
            against those who favoured the people, calling them <lb/>
            demagogues and betrayers of their own order, alleging <lb/>
            that by such gratification they did but cherish that <lb/>
            spirit of boldness and arrogance which had been spread <lb/>
            among the people against the patricians, which they <lb/>
            would have done well to crush upon its first appearance, <lb/>
            and not suffer the plebeians to grow so strong by giving <lb/>
            so much power to the tribunes of the people. Now, <lb/>
            he urged, they had become formidable because every <lb/>
            demand they made had been agreed to, and nothing done <lb/>
            against their wishes; they contemned the authority of <lb/>
            the consuls, and lived in defiance of the constitution, <lb/>
            governed only by their own seditious ringleaders, to <lb/>
            whom they gave the title of tribunes. For the Senate <lb/>
            to sit and decree largesses of corn to the populace, as is <lb/>
            done in the most democratic States in Greece, would <lb/>
            merely be to pay them for their disobedience, to the <lb/>
            common ruin of all classes. " They cannot," he went on <lb/>
            to say, " consider this largess of corn to be a reward for <lb/>
            the campaign in which they have refused to serve, or for <lb/>
            the secession by which they betrayed their country, or <lb/>
            the scandals which they have been so willing to believe <lb/>
            against the Senate. As they cannot be said to deserve <lb/>
            this bounty, they will imagine that it has been bestowed <lb/>
            upon them by you because you fear them, and wish to <lb/>
            pay your court to them. In this case there will be no <lb/>
            bounds to their insubordination, and they never will <lb/>
            cease from riots and disorders. To give it them is clearly <lb/>
            an insane proceeding; nay, we ought rather, if we are <lb/>
            wise, to take away from them this privilege of the <lb/>
            tribuneship, which is a distinct subversion of the con. <note type="footnote"> 2 B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            sulate, and a cause of dissension in the city, which now <lb/>
            is no longer one, as before, but is rent asunder in such a <lb/>
            manner that there is no prospect of our ever being re­ <lb/>
            united, and ceasing to be divided into two hostile factions."</p>
          <p>XVII. With much talk to this effect Marcius excited <lb/>
            the young men, with whom he was influential, and nearly <lb/>
            all the richer classes, who loudly declared that he was <lb/>
            the only man in the State who was insensible both to <lb/>
            force and to flattery. Some of the elders, however, op­ <lb/>
            posed him, foreseeing what would be the result of his <lb/>
            policy. Indeed, no good resulted from it. The tribunes <lb/>
            of the people, as soon as they heard that Marcius had <lb/>
            carried his point, rushed down into the forum and called <lb/>
            loudly upon the people to assemble and stand by them. <lb/>
            A disorderly assembly took place, and on a report being <lb/>
            made of Marcius's speech, the fury of the people was so <lb/>
            great that it was proposed to break into the senate house; <lb/>
            but the tribunes turned all the blame upon Marcius alone, <lb/>
            and sent for him to come and speak in his own defence. <lb/>
            As this demand was insolently refused, the tribunes <lb/>
            themselves, together with the aediles, went to bring him <lb/>
            by force, and actually laid hands upon him. However, <lb/>
            the patricians rallied round him, thrust away the tribunes <lb/>
            of the people, and even beat the aediles, their assistants in <lb/>
            this quarrel. Night put an end to the conflict, but at <lb/>
            daybreak the consuls, seeing the people terribly excited, <lb/>
            and gathering in the forum from all quarters, began to <lb/>
            fear the consequences of their fury. They assembled the <lb/>
            senators and bade them endeavour, by mild language and <lb/>
            healing measures, to pacify the multitude, as it was no <lb/>
            season for pride or for standing upon their dignity, but <lb/>
            if they were wise they would perceive that so dangerous <lb/>
            and critical a posture of affairs required a temperate and <lb/>
            popular policy. The majority of the senators yielded, and <lb/>
            the consuls proceeded to soothe the people in the best way <lb/>
            they could, answering gently such charges as had been <lb/>
            brought against them, even speaking with the utmost <lb/>
            caution when blaming the people for their late outrageous <lb/>
            conduct, and declaring that there should be no difference <lb/>
            of opinion between them about the way in which corn <lb/>
            should be supplied, and about the price of provisions.</p><pb n="371"/>
            
          <p>XVIII. As the people now for the most part had <lb/>
            cooled down, and from their attentive and orderly de­ <lb/>
            meanour were evidently much wrought upon by the <lb/>
            words of the consuls, the tribunes came forward and <lb/>
            addressed them. They said that now that the Senate had <lb/>
            come to a better frame of mind, the people would <lb/>
            willingly make concessions in their turn; but they <lb/>
            insisted that Marcius should apologise for his conduct, <lb/>
            or deny if he could that he had excited the Senate to <lb/>
            destroy the constitution, that when summoned to appear <lb/>
            he had disobeyed, and that finally he had, by beating <lb/>
            and insulting the aediles in the market-place, done all <lb/>
            that lay in his power to raise a civil war and make the <lb/>
            citizens shed one another's blood. Their object in saying <lb/>
            this was either to humble Marcius, by making him <lb/>
            entreat the clemency of the people, which was much <lb/>
            against his haughty temper, or else expecting that he. <lb/>
            would yield to his fiery nature and make the breach <lb/>
            between himself and the people incurable. The latter <lb/>
            was what they hoped for from their knowledge of his <lb/>
            character.</p>
          <p>Marcius came forward to speak in his defence, and the <lb/>
            people stood listening in dead silence. But when, instead <lb/>
            of the apologetic speech which they expected, he began to <lb/>
            speak with a freedom which seemed more like accusing <lb/>
            them than defending himself, while the tones of his voice <lb/>
            and the expression of his countenance showed a fearless <lb/>
            contempt for his audience, the people became angry, and <lb/>
            plainly showed their disapprobation of what he said. <lb/>
            Upon this, Sicinnius, the boldest of the tribunes, after a <lb/>
            short consultation with his colleagues, came forward and <lb/>
            said that the tribunes had condemned Marcius to suffer <lb/>
            the penalty of death, and ordered the aediles to lead him <lb/>
            at once to the Capitol, and cast him down the Tarpeian <lb/>
            rock. When the aediles laid hold of him, many of the <lb/>
            people themselves seemed struck with horror and remorse, <lb/>
            and the patricians in the wildest excitement, called upon <lb/>
            one another to rescue him, and by main force tore him <lb/>
            from his assailants and placed him in the midst of them­ <lb/>
            selves. Some of them held out their hands and besought <lb/>
            the populace by signs, as no voice could be heard in such <note type="footnote"> 2B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            an uproar. At last the friends and relations of the <lb/>
            tribunes, seeing that it was impossible to carry out their <lb/>
            sentence on Marcius without much bloodshed, persuaded <lb/>
            them to alter the cruel and unprecedented part of the <lb/>
            sentence, and not to put him to death by violence, or <lb/>
            without a trial, but to refer the matter to the people, to <lb/>
            be voted upon by them. Upon this Sicinnius, turning to <lb/>
            the patricians, demanded what they meant by rescuing <lb/>
            Marcius from the people when they intended to punish <lb/>
            him. They at once retorted, " Nay, what do you mean by <lb/>
            dragging one of the bravest and best men in Rome to a <lb/>
            cruel and illegal death?" "You shall not," answered <lb/>
            Sicinnius, "make that a ground of quarrel with the <lb/>
            people, for we allow you what you demand, that this man <lb/>
            be put on his trial. You, Marcius, we summon to <lb/>
            appear in the forum on the third market-day ensuing, <lb/>
            and prove your innocence if you can, as the votes of your <lb/>
            countrymen will be then taken about your conduct."</p>
          <p>XIX. The patricians were glad enough to terminate <lb/>
            the affair in this way, and retired rejoicing, bearing <lb/>
            Marcius with them. During the time which was to <lb/>
            elapse before the third market-day (which the Romans <lb/>
            hold on every ninth day, and therefore call them <lb/>
            nundinæ), they had some hope that a campaign against <lb/>
            the people of Antium would enable them to put off the <lb/>
            trial until the people's anger had abated through length <lb/>
            of time and warlike occupations; afterwards, as they <lb/>
            came to terms at once with the Antiates, the patricians <lb/>
            held frequent meetings, in which they expressed their <lb/>
            fear of the people, and considered by what means they <lb/>
            could avoid delivering Marcius up to them, and prevent <lb/>
            their mob orators from exciting them. Appius Claudius, <lb/>
            who had the reputation of being the bitterest enemy of <lb/>
            the people in Rome, gave it as his opinion that the Senate <lb/>
            would destroy itself and ruin the State utterly if it per­ <lb/>
            mitted the people to assume the power of trying patri­ <lb/>
            cians and voting on their trials ; while the older men, and <lb/>
            those who were more inclined to the popular side, thought <lb/>
            that this power would render the people gentle and <lb/>
            temperate, and not savage and cruel. The people, they <lb/>
            aaid, did not despise the Senate, but imagined that they <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            were despised by it, so that this privilege of holding the <lb/>
            trial would agreeably salve their wounded vanity, and, as <lb/>
            they exercised their franchise, they would lay aside their <lb/>
            anger.</p>
          <p>XX. Marcius, perceiving that the Senate, divided be­ <lb/>
            tween their regard for himself and their fear of the <lb/>
            people, knew not what to do, himself asked the tribunes <lb/>
            of the people what it was that he was charged with, and <lb/>
            what indictment they intended to bring against him at <lb/>
            his trial. When they answered that the charge against <lb/>
            him was one of treason, because he had attempted to <lb/>
            make himself absolute despot in Rome, and that they <lb/>
            would prove it, he at once rose, saying that he would at <lb/>
            once defend himself before the people on that score, and <lb/>
            that if he were convicted, he would not refuse to undergo <lb/>
            any punishment whatever; “ Only," said he, “ do not bring <lb/>
            forward some other charge against me, and deceive the <lb/>
            Senate." When they had agreed upon these conditions, <lb/>
            the trial took place.</p>
          <p>The tribunes, however, when the people assembled, <lb/>
            made them vote by tribes, and not by centuries ;* by which <lb/>
            device the votes of rich respectable men who had served <lb/>
            the State in the wars would be swamped by those of the <lb/>
            needy rabble who cared nothing for truth or honour. In <lb/>
            the next place, they passed by the charge of treason, as <lb/>
            being impossible to prove, and repeated what Marcius had <lb/>
            orignally said before the Senate, when he dissuaded them <lb/>
            from lowering the price of corn, and advised the abolition <lb/>
            of the office of tribune. A new count in the indictment <lb/>
            was that he had not paid over the money raised by the <lb/>
            sale of the plunder after his expedition against Antium, <lb/>
            but had divided it among his own followers. This last <lb/>
            accusation is said to have disturbed Marcius more than all <lb/>
            the rest, as he had never expected it, and was not pre­ <lb/>
            pared with any answer that would satisfy the people, so <lb/>
            that the praises which he bestowed on those who had <lb/>
            made that campaign with him only angered the far <lb/>
            greater number who had not done so. At last the people <lb/>
            voted. Marcius was condemned by a majority of the <lb/>
            tribes, and was sentenced to perpetual banishment. After <note type="footnote"> *See the article “Comitia” in Dr. Smith's Dictionary of <lb/>
            Antiquities. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            sentence was passed, the people displayed greater joy than <lb/>
            if they had won a pitched battle, while the Senate was <lb/>
            downcast and filled with regret at not having run any <lb/>
            risks rather than allow the people to obtain so much <lb/>
            power, and use it so insolently. Nor was there any need <lb/>
            for distinctions of dress or anything else to distinguish the <lb/>
            two parties, because a plebeian might be told at once by <lb/>
            his delight, a patrician by his sorrow.</p>
          <p>XXI. Marcius himself, however, remained unmoved. <lb/>
            Proud and haughty as ever, he appeared not to be sorry <lb/>
            for himself, and to be the only one of the patricians who <lb/>
            was not. This calmness, however, was not due to any even­ <lb/>
            ness of temper or any intention of bearing his wrongs <lb/>
            meekly. It arose from concentrated rage and fury, which <lb/>
            many do not know to be an expression of great grief. <lb/>
            When the mind is inflamed with this passion, it casts out <lb/>
            all ideas of submission or of quiet. Hence an angry man <lb/>
            is courageous, just as a fever patient is hot, because of the <lb/>
            inflamed throbbing excitement of his mind. And Marcius <lb/>
            soon showed that this was his own condition. He went <lb/>
            home, embraced his weeping wife and mother, bade them <lb/>
            bear this calamity with patience, and at once proceeded <lb/>
            to the city gates, escorted by the patricians in a body. <lb/>
            Thence, taking nothing with him, and asking no man for <lb/>
            any thing, he went off, accompanied by three or four of his <lb/>
            clients. He remained for a few days at some farms near <lb/>
            the city, agitated deeply by conflicting passions. His <lb/>
            anger suggested no scheme by which he might benefit <lb/>
            himself, but only how to revenge himself on the Romans. <lb/>
            At length he decided that he would raise up a cruel war <lb/>
            against them, and proceeded at once to make application <lb/>
            to the neighbouring nation of the Volscians, whom he <lb/>
            knew to be rich and powerful, and only to have suffered <lb/>
            sufficiently by their late defeats to make them desirous of <lb/>
            renewing their quarrel with Rome.</p>
          <p>XXII. There was a certain citizen of Antium named <lb/>
            Tullus Aufidius, who, from his wealth, courage, and noble <lb/>
            birth, was regarded as the most important man in the whole <lb/>
            Volscian nation. Marcius knew that this man hated him <lb/>
            more than any other Roman ; for in battle they had often <lb/>
            met, and by challenging and defying one another, as <lb/>
            young warriors are 'ont to do, they had, in addition to <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            their national antipathy, gained a violent personal hatred <lb/>
            for one another. In spite of this, however, knowing the <lb/>
            generous nature of Tullus, and longing more than any <lb/>
            Volscian to requite the Romans for their treatment, he <lb/>
            justified the verses, <lb/>
            “Tis hard to strive with rage, which aye, <lb/>
            Though life's the forfeit, gains its way." <lb/>
            He disguised himself as completely as he could, and, <lb/>
            like Ulysses, <lb/>
            A, Into the city of his foes he came ”</p>
          <p>XXIII. It was evening when he entered Antium, and <lb/>
            although many met him, no one recognised him. He <lb/>
            went to Tullus's house, and entering, sat down by the <lb/>
            hearth in silence, with his head wrapped in his cloak. <lb/>
            The domestics, astonished at his behaviour, did not dare to <lb/>
            disturb him, as there was a certain dignity about his <lb/>
            appearance and his silence, but went and told Tullus, <lb/>
            who was at supper, of this strange incident. Tullus rose, <lb/>
            went to him, and inquired who he was and what he <lb/>
            wanted. Then at length Marcius uncovered his face, and, <lb/>
            after a short pause, said, “ If you do not recognise me, <lb/>
            Tullus, or if you do not believe your eyes, I must myself <lb/>
            tell you who I am. I am Caius Marcius, who has <lb/>
            wrought you and the Volscians more mischief than any <lb/>
            one else, and who, lest I should deny this, have received <lb/>
            the additional title of Coriolanus. This I cannot lose: <lb/>
            every thing else has been taken from me by the envious <lb/>
            spite of the people, and the treacherous remissness of the <lb/>
            upper classes. I am an exile, and I now sit as a suppliant <lb/>
            on your hearth, begging you, not for safety or protection, <lb/>
            for should I have come hither if I feared to die, but for <lb/>
            vengeance against those who drove me forth, which I am <lb/>
            already beginning to receive by putting myself in your <lb/>
            hands. If then, my brave Tullus, you wish to attack <lb/>
            your foes, make use of my misfortunes, and let my dis­ <lb/>
            grace be the common happiness of all the Volscians. I <lb/>
            shall fight for you much better than I have fought against <lb/>
            you, because I have the advantage of knowing exactly <lb/>
            the strength and weakness of the enemy. If, however, <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            you are tired of war, I have no wish for life, nor is it to <lb/>
            your credit to save the life of one who once was your <lb/>
            personal enemy, and who now is worn out and useless." <lb/>
            Tullus was greatly delighted with this speech, and giving <lb/>
            him his right hand, answered, "Rise, Marcius, and be <lb/>
            of good courage. You have brought us a noble present, <lb/>
            yourself; rest assured that the Volscians will not be <lb/>
            ungrateful." He then feasted Marcius with great hospi­ <lb/>
            tal ty, and for some days they conferred together as to the <lb/>
            boot method of carrying on the war.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Rome meanwhile was disturbed by the anger <lb/>
            of the patricians towards the plebeians, especially on <lb/>
            account of the banishment of Marcius, and by many por­ <lb/>
            tents which were observed both by the priests and by <lb/>
            private persons, one of which was as follows. There was <lb/>
            one Titus Latinus, a man of no great note, but a respect­ <lb/>
            able citizen and by no means addicted to superstition. <lb/>
            He dreamed that he saw Jupiter face to face, and that <lb/>
            the god bade him tell the Senate that “ they had sent a <lb/>
            bad dancer before his procession, and one who was very <lb/>
            displeasing to him."</p>
          <p>On first seeing this vision he said that he disregarded <lb/>
            it; but after it had occurred a second and a third time he <lb/>
            had the unhappiness to see his son sicken and die, while <lb/>
            he himself suddenly lost the use of his limbs.</p>
          <p>He told this story in the senate house, to which he had <lb/>
            been carried on a litter; and as soon as he had told it, he <lb/>
            found his bodily strength return, rose, and walked home.</p>
          <p>The senators, greatly astonished, inquired into the <lb/>
            matter. It was found that a slave, convicted of some <lb/>
            crime, had been ordered by his master to be flogged <lb/>
            through the market-place, and then put to death. While <lb/>
            this was being done, and the wretch was twisting his <lb/>
            body in every kind of contortion as he writhed under the <lb/>
            blows, the procession by chance was following after him. <lb/>
            Many of those who walked in it were shocked at the <lb/>
            unseemliness of the spectacle, and disgusted at its <lb/>
            inhumanity, but no one did anything more than reproach <lb/>
            and execrate a man who treated his slaves with so much <lb/>
            cruelty.</p>
          <p>At that period men treated their slaves with great <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            xindness, because the master himself worked and ate in <lb/>
            their company, and so could sympathise more with them. <lb/>
            The great punishment for a slave who had done wrong <lb/>
            was to make him carry round the neighbourhood the <lb/>
            piece of wood on which the pole of a waggon is rested. <lb/>
            The slave who has done this and been seen by the neigh­ <lb/>
            bours and friends, lost his credit, and was called furcifer, <lb/>
            for the Romans call that piece of timber furca, “a fork," <lb/>
            which the Greeks call hypostates, " a supporter."</p>
          <p>XXV. So when Latinus related his dream to the sena­ <lb/>
            tors, and they were wondering who the bad and unac­ <lb/>
            ceptable dancer could be who had led the procession, some <lb/>
            of them remembered the slave who had been flogged <lb/>
            through the market-place and there put to death. At <lb/>
            the instance of the priests, the master of the slave was <lb/>
            punished for his cruelty, and the procession and ceremonies <lb/>
            were performed anew in honour of the gods. Hence we <lb/>
            may see how wisely Numa arranged this, among other <lb/>
            matters of ceremonial. Whenever the magistrates or <lb/>
            priests were engaged in any religious rite, a herald <lb/>
            walked before them crying in a loud voice “Hoc age." <lb/>
            The meaning of the phrase is, " Do this," meaning to tell <lb/>
            the people to apply their minds entirely to the religious <lb/>
            ceremony, and not to allow any thought of worldly things <lb/>
            to distract their attention, because men as a rule only <lb/>
            attend to such matters by putting a certain constraint on <lb/>
            their thoughts.</p>
          <p>It is the custom in Rome to begin a sacrifice, a pro­ <lb/>
            cession, or a spectacle, over again, not only when anything <lb/>
            of this kind happens, but for any trifling reason. Thus, <lb/>
            if one of the horses drawing the sacred car called Thensa <lb/>
            stumbles, or the charioteer takes the reins in his left <lb/>
            hand, they have decreed that the procession must begin <lb/>
            again. In later times they have been known to perform <lb/>
            one sacrifice thirty times, because every time some slight <lb/>
            omission or mistake took place.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Meanwhile Marcius and Tullus in Antium held <lb/>
            private conferences with the chief men of the Volscians, <lb/>
            and advised them to begin the war while Rome was <lb/>
            divided by its domestic quarrels. They discountenanced <lb/>
            this proposal, because a truce and cessation of hostilities <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            for two years had been agreed upon : but the Romans <lb/>
            themselves gave them a pretext for breaking the truce, <lb/>
            by a proclamation which was made at the public games, <lb/>
            that all Volscians should quit the city before sunset. <lb/>
            Some say this was effected by a stratagem of Marcius, <lb/>
            who sent a false accusation against the Volscians to the <lb/>
            magistrates at Rome, saying that during the publiogames <lb/>
            they meant to attack the Romans and burn the city. <lb/>
            This proclamation made them yet bitterer enemies to the <lb/>
            Romans than before; and Tullus, wishing to bring the <lb/>
            business to a climax, induced his countrymen to send <lb/>
            ambassadors to Rome to demand back the cities and <lb/>
            territory which the Romans had taken from the Volscians <lb/>
            in the late war. The Romans were very indignant when <lb/>
            they heard these demands, and made answer, that the <lb/>
            Volscians might be the first to take up arms, but that the <lb/>
            Romans would be the last to lay them down. Upon this, <lb/>
            Tullus convoked a general assembly, in which, after de­ <lb/>
            termining upon war, he advised them to summon Marcius <lb/>
            to their aid, not owing him any grudge for what they had <lb/>
            suffered at his hands, but believing that he would be <lb/>
            more valuable to them as a friend than he had been <lb/>
            dangerous as an enemy.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Marcius was called before the assembly, and <lb/>
            having addressed the people, was thought by them to know <lb/>
            how to speak as well as how to fight, and was considered <lb/>
            to be a man of great ability and courage. He, together <lb/>
            with Tullus, was nominated general with unlimited <lb/>
            powers. As he feared the Volscians would take a long <lb/>
            time to prepare for the war, and that meanwhile the <lb/>
            opportunity for attack might pass away, he ordered the <lb/>
            leading men in the city to make all necessary prepara­ <lb/>
            tions, and himself taking the boldest and most forward <lb/>
            as volunteers, without levying any troops by compulsory <lb/>
            conscription, made a sudden and unexpected inroad into <lb/>
            the Roman territory. Here he obtained so much plunder <lb/>
            that the Volscians were wearied with carrying it off and <lb/>
            consuming it in their camp. However, his least object <lb/>
            was to obtain plunder and lay waste the country; his <lb/>
            main desire was to render the patricians suspected by the <lb/>
            people. While all else was ravaged and destroyed, he <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            carefully protected their farms, and would not allow any <lb/>
            damage to be done or anything to be carried off from <lb/>
            them. This increased the disorders at Rome, the patri­ <lb/>
            cians reproaching the people for having unjustly banished <lb/>
            so able a man, while the plebeians accused them of having <lb/>
            invited Marcius to attack in order to obtain their revenge, <lb/>
            and said that, while others fought, they sat as idle <lb/>
            spectators, having in the war itself a sure safeguard of <lb/>
            their wealth and estates. Having produced this new <lb/>
            quarrel among the Romans, and, besides loading the <lb/>
            Volscians with plunder, having taught them to despise <lb/>
            their enemy, Marcius led his troops back in safety.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. By great and zealous exertions the entire <lb/>
            Volscian nation was soon assembled under arms. The <lb/>
            force thus raised was very large; part was left to garrison <lb/>
            the cities, as a measure of precaution, while the rest was <lb/>
            to be used in the campaign against Rome. Marcius now <lb/>
            left Tullus to determine which corps he would command. <lb/>
            Tullus, in answer, said that as Marcius, he knew, was as <lb/>
            brave a man as himself, and had always enjoyed better <lb/>
            fortune in all his battles, he had better command the <lb/>
            army in the field. He himself, he added, would remain <lb/>
            behind, watch over the safety of the Volscian cities, and <lb/>
            supply the troops with necessaries. Marcius, strengthened <lb/>
            by this division of the command, marched to the town of <lb/>
            Circeii, a Roman colony. As it surrendered, he did it no <lb/>
            harm, but laid waste the country of Latium, where he <lb/>
            expected the Romans would fight a battle in defence of <lb/>
            their allies the Latins, who frequently sent to entreat <lb/>
            their protection. But at Rome the people were unwilling <lb/>
            to fight, and the consuls were just at the expiry of their <lb/>
            term of office, so that they did not care to run any risks, <lb/>
            and therefore rejected the appeals of the Latins. Marcius <lb/>
            now led his troops against the Latian cities, Tolerium, <lb/>
            Labici, Pedum, and Bola, all of which he took by storm, <lb/>
            sold the inhabitants for slaves, and plundered the houses. <lb/>
            Those cities, however, which voluntarily came to his <lb/>
            side he treated with the utmost consideration, even <lb/>
            pitching his camp at a distance, for fear they might <lb/>
            be injured by the soldiery against his will, and never <lb/>
            plundering their territory.</p><pb n="380"/>
            
          <p>XXIX. When at last he took Bollæ, a town not more <lb/>
            than twelve miles from Rome, obtaining immense booty <lb/>
            and putting nearly all the adult inhabitants to the sword, <lb/>
            then not even those Yolscians who had been appointed to <lb/>
            garrison the cities would any longer remain at their posts, <lb/>
            but seized their arms and joined the army of Marcius, <lb/>
            declaring that he was their only general, and that they <lb/>
            would recognise no other leader. His renown and glory <lb/>
            spread throughout all Italy, and all men were astonished <lb/>
            that one man by changing sides should have produced so <lb/>
            great a change. The affairs of Rome were in the last <lb/>
            disorder, the people refusing to fight, while internal <lb/>
            quarrels and seditious speeches took place daily, until news <lb/>
            came that Lavinium was being invested by the enemy. <lb/>
            This town contains the most ancient images and sacred <lb/>
            things of the tutelary deities of Rome, and is the origin of <lb/>
            the Roman people, being the first town founded by AEneas.</p>
          <p>Upon this a very singular change of opinions betel both <lb/>
            the people and the Senate. The people were eager to <lb/>
            annul their sentence against Marcius, and to beg him to <lb/>
            return, but the Senate, after meeting and considering this <lb/>
            proposal, finally rejected it, either out of a mere spirit of <lb/>
            opposition to anything proposed by the people, or because <lb/>
            they did not wish him to return by favour of the people ; <lb/>
            or it may be because they themselves were now angry <lb/>
            with him for having shown himself the enemy of all <lb/>
            classes alike, although he had only been injured by one, <lb/>
            and for having become the avowed enemy of his country, <lb/>
            in which he knew that the best and noblest all sympathised <lb/>
            with him, and had suffered along with him. When this <lb/>
            resolution was made known to the people, they were un­ <lb/>
            able to proceed to vote or to pass any bill on the subject, <lb/>
            without a previous decree of the Senate.</p>
          <p>XXX. Marcius when he heard of this was more ex­ <lb/>
            asperated than ever. He raised his siege of Lavinium, <lb/>
            marched straight upon Rome, and pitched his camp five <lb/>
            miles from the city, at the place called Fossœ Cluiliœ. <lb/>
            The appearance of his army caused much terror and <lb/>
            disturbance, but nevertheless put an end to sedition, for <lb/>
            no magistrate or patrician dared any longer oppose the <lb/>
            people's desire to recall him. When they beheld the <lb/>
             <pb n="381"/>
            women running distractedly through the city, the ola <lb/>
            men weeping and praying at the altars, and no one <lb/>
            able to take courage and form any plan of defence, it was <lb/>
            agreed that the people had been right in wishing to come <lb/>
            to terms with Marcius, and that the Senate had committed <lb/>
            a fatal error in inflicting a new outrage upon him, just at <lb/>
            the time when all unkindness might have been buried. <lb/>
            It was determined, therefore, by the whole city that an <lb/>
            embassy should be despatched to Marcius, to offer him <lb/>
            restoration to his own country, and to beg of him to make <lb/>
            peace. Those of the Senate who were sent were relations <lb/>
            of Marcius, and expected to be warmly welcomed by a <lb/>
            man who was their near relation and personal friend. <lb/>
            Nothing of the kind, however, happened. They were <lb/>
            conducted through the enemy's camp, and found him <lb/>
            seated, and displaying insufferable pride and arrogance, <lb/>
            with the chiefs of the Volscians standing round him. He <lb/>
            bade the ambassadors deliver their message; and after <lb/>
            they had, in a supplicatory fashion, pronounced a con­ <lb/>
            ciliatory oration, he answered them, dwelling with bitter­ <lb/>
            ness on his own unjust treatment; and then in his capacity <lb/>
            of general-in-chief of the Volscians, he bade them restore <lb/>
            the cities and territory which they had conquered in the <lb/>
            late war, and to grant the franchise to the Volscians on <lb/>
            the same terms as enjoyed by the Latins. These, he said, <lb/>
            were the only conditions on which a just and lasting <lb/>
            peace could be made. He allowed them a space of thirty <lb/>
            days for deliberation, and on the departure of the <lb/>
            ambassadors immediately drew off his forces.</p>
          <p>XXXI. This affair gave an opportunity to several of <lb/>
            the Volscians, who had long envied and disliked his repu <lb/>
            tation, and the influence which he had with the people. <lb/>
            Among these was Tullus himself, who had not been per­ <lb/>
            sonally wronged by Marcius, but who, as it is natural <lb/>
            he should, felt vexed at being totally eclipsed and <lb/>
            thrown into the shade, for the Volscians now thought <lb/>
            Marcius the greatest man in their whole nation, and con. <lb/>
            sidered that any one else ought to be thankful for any <lb/>
            measure of authority that he might think fit to bestow <lb/>
            Hence secret hints were exchanged, and private meetings <lb/>
            held, in which his enemies expressed their dissatisfaction, <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            calling the retreat from Rome an act of treason, not indeed <lb/>
            that he had betrayed any cities or armies to the enemy, <lb/>
            but he had granted them time, by which all other things <lb/>
            are won and lost. He had given the enemy a breathing <lb/>
            time, they said, of thirty days, being no less than they <lb/>
            required to put themselves in a posture of defence.</p>
          <p>Marcius during this time was not idle, for he attacked <lb/>
            and defeated the allies of the Romans, and captured seven <lb/>
            large and populous towns. The Romans did not venture <lb/>
            to come to help their allies, but hung back from taking <lb/>
            the field, and seemed as if paralysed and benumbed. When <lb/>
            the term had expired, Marcius presented himself a second <lb/>
            time before Rome, with his entire army. The Romans now <lb/>
            sent a second embassy, begging him to lay aside his anger, <lb/>
            withdraw the Volscians from the country, and then to <lb/>
            make such terms as would be for the advantage of both <lb/>
            nations. The Romans, they said, would yield nothing to <lb/>
            fear; but if he thought that special concessions ought to <lb/>
            be made to the Volscians, they would be duly considered <lb/>
            if they laid down their arms. To this Marcius answered <lb/>
            that, as general of the Volscians, he could give them no <lb/>
            answer; but that as one who was still a citizen of Rome <lb/>
            he would advise them to adopt a humbler frame of mind, <lb/>
            and come to him in three days with a ratification of his <lb/>
            proposals. If they should come to any other determine <lb/>
            tion, he warned them that it would not be safe for them <lb/>
            to come to his camp again with empty words.</p>
          <p>XXXII. When the ambassadors returned, and the <lb/>
            Senate heard their report, they determined in this dread­ <lb/>
            ful extremity to let go their sheet anchor. They ordered <lb/>
            all the priests, ministers, and guardians of the sacred <lb/>
            mysteries, and all the hereditary prophets who watched <lb/>
            the omens given by the flight of birds, to go in procession <lb/>
            to Marcius, dressed in their sacred vestments, and beseech <lb/>
            him to desist from the war, and then to negotiate condi­ <lb/>
            tions of peace between his countrymen and the Volscians. <lb/>
            Marcius received the priests in his camp, but relaxed <lb/>
            nothing of his former harshness, bidding the Romans <lb/>
            either accept his proposals or continue the war.</p>
          <p>When the priests returned, the Romans resolved in <lb/>
            future to remain within the city, repulse any assault <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            which might be made on the walls, and trust to time and <lb/>
            fortune, as it was evident that they could not be saved by <lb/>
            anything that they could do. The city was full of con­ <lb/>
            fusion, excitement, and panic terror, until there happened <lb/>
            something like what is mentioned in Homer, but which <lb/>
            men as a rule are unwilling to believe. He observes that <lb/>
            on great and important occasions <lb/>
            “ Athene placed a thought within his mind f <lb/>
            and again­ <lb/>
            "But some one of th* immortals changed my mind, <lb/>
            And made me think of what the folk would say <lb/>
            and­ <lb/>
            “ Because he thought it, or because the god <lb/>
            Commanded him to do so."</p>
          <p>Men despise the poet, as if, in order to carry out his <lb/>
            absurd mythological scheme, he denied each man his <lb/>
            liberty of will. Now Homer does nothing of this kind, <lb/>
            for whatever is reasonable and likely he ascribes to the <lb/>
            exercise of our own powers, as we see in the common <lb/>
            phrase.­ <lb/>
            “ But I reflected in my mighty soul <lb/>
            and­ <lb/>
            “ Thus spoke he, but the son of Peleus raged, <lb/>
            Divided was his soul within his breast;" <lb/>
            and again­ <lb/>
            “But she persuaded not <lb/>
            The wise Bellerophon, of noble mind." <lb/>
            But in strange and unlikely actions, where the actors <lb/>
            must have been under the influence of some supernatural <lb/>
            impulse, he does speak of the god not as destroying, but <lb/>
            as directing the human will; nor does the god directly <lb/>
            produce any decision, but suggests ideas which influence <lb/>
            that decision. Thus the act is not an involuntary <lb/>
            one, but opportunity is given for a voluntary act, with <lb/>
            confidence and good hope superadded. For either we <lb/>
            must admit that the gods have no dealings and influence <lb/>
            at all with men, or else it must be in this way that they <lb/>
            act when they assist and strengthen us, not of course by <lb/>
            moving our hands and feet, but by filling our minds with <lb/>
             <pb n="384"/>
            thoughts and ideas which either encourage us to do what <lb/>
            is right, or restrain us from what is wrong.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. At Rome at this time the women were pray­ <lb/>
            ing in all the temples, especially in that of Jupiter in the <lb/>
            Capitol, where the noblest ladies in Rome were assembled. <lb/>
            Among them was Valeria, the sister of the great Poplicola, <lb/>
            who had done such great services to the State both in <lb/>
            peace and war. Poplicola died some time before, as has <lb/>
            been related in his Life, but his sister was held in great <lb/>
            honour and esteem in Rome, as her life did credit to her <lb/>
            noble birth. She now experienced one of the divine im­ <lb/>
            pulses of which I have spoken, and, inspired by Heaven to <lb/>
            do what was best for her country, rose and called on the <lb/>
            other ladies to accompany her to the house of Volumnia, <lb/>
            the mother of Marcius. On entering, and finding her sit­ <lb/>
            ting with her daughter-in-law, nursing the children of <lb/>
            Marcius, Valeria placed her companions in a circle round <lb/>
            them, and spoke as follows: “Volumnia, and you, <lb/>
            Virgilia, we have come to you, as women to women, with­ <lb/>
            out any decree of the Senate or instructions from a magis­ <lb/>
            trate ; but Heaven, it would appear, has heard our prayers, <lb/>
            and has inspired us with the idea of coming hither to beg <lb/>
            of you to save our countrymen, and to gain for yourselves <lb/>
            greater glory than that of the Sabine women when they <lb/>
            reconciled their husbands and their fathers. Come with <lb/>
            us to Marcius, join us in supplicating him for mercy, and <lb/>
            bear an honourable testimony to your country, that it <lb/>
            never has thought of hurting you, however terribly it has <lb/>
            been injured by Marcius, but that it restores you to him <lb/>
            uninjured, although possibly it will gain no better terms <lb/>
            by so doing." When Valeria had spoken thus, the other <lb/>
            women applauded, and Volumnia answered in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing words : " My friends, besides those sufferings which <lb/>
            all are now undergoing, we are especially to be pitied. <lb/>
            We have lost the glory and goodness of our Marcius, and <lb/>
            now see him more imprisoned in than protected by the <lb/>
            army of the enemy. But the greatest misfortune of all is <lb/>
            that our country should have become so weak as to be <lb/>
            obliged to rest its hopes of safety on us. I cannot tell if <lb/>
            he will pay any attention to us, seeing that he has treated <lb/>
            his native country with scorn, although he used to love it <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            better than his mother, his wife, and his children. How­ <lb/>
            ever, take us, and make what use of us you can. Lead us <lb/>
            into his presence, and there, if we can do nothing else, we <lb/>
            can die at his feet supplicating for Rome.,,</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Having spoken thus, she took Virgilia and <lb/>
            her children, and proceeded, in company with the other <lb/>
            women, to the Volscian camp. Their piteous appearance <lb/>
            produced, even in their enemies, a silent respect. Marcius <lb/>
            himself was seated on his tribunal with the chief officers; <lb/>
            and when he saw the procession of women was at first <lb/>
            filled with amazement; but when he recognised his <lb/>
            mother walking first, although he tried to support his <lb/>
            usual stern composure, he was overcome by his emotion. <lb/>
            He could not bear to receive her sitting, but descended <lb/>
            and ran to meet her. He embraced his mother first, and <lb/>
            longest of all; and then his wife and children, no longer <lb/>
            restraining his tears and caresses, but completely carried <lb/>
            away by his feelings.</p>
          <p>XXXV. When he had taken his fill of embraces, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving that his mother desired to address him, he called <lb/>
            the chiefs of the Volscians together, and listened to <lb/>
            Volumnia, who addressed him as follows:</p>
          <p>“ You may judge, my son, by our dress and appearance, <lb/>
            even though we keep silence, to what a miserable con­ <lb/>
            dition your exile has reduced us at home. Think now, <lb/>
            how unhappy we must be, beyond all other women, <lb/>
            when fortune has made the sight which ought to be most <lb/>
            pleasing to us, most terrible, when I see my son, and <lb/>
            your wife here sees her husband, besieging his native city. <lb/>
            Even that which consoles people under all other misfor­ <lb/>
            tunes, prayer to the gods, has become impossible for us. <lb/>
            We cannot beg of heaven to give us the victory and to <lb/>
            save you, but our prayers for you must always resemble <lb/>
            the imprecations of our enemies against Rome. Your <lb/>
            wife and children are in such a position, that they must <lb/>
            either lose you or lose their native country For my own <lb/>
            part, I cannot bear to live until fortune decides the event <lb/>
            of this war. If I cannot now persuade you to make a <lb/>
            lasting peace, and so become the benefactor instead of the <lb/>
            scourge of the two nations, be well assured that you shall <lb/>
            never assail Rome without first passing over the corpse <note type="footnote"> 2 c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="386"/>
            of your mother. I cannot wait for that day on which I <lb/>
            shall either see my countrymen triumphing over my son, <lb/>
            or my son triumphing over his country. If indeed I <lb/>
            were to ask you to betray the Volscians and save your <lb/>
            country, this would be a hard request for you to grant; <lb/>
            for though it is base to destroy one's own fellow citizens, <lb/>
            it is equally wrong to betray those who have trusted you. <lb/>
            But we merely ask for a respite from our sufferings, <lb/>
            which will save both nations alike from ruin, and which <lb/>
            will be all the more glorious for the Volscians because <lb/>
            their superiority in the field has put them in a position <lb/>
            to grant us the greatest of blessings, peace and concord, <lb/>
            in which they also will share alike with us. You will be <lb/>
            chiefly to be thanked for these blessings, if we obtain <lb/>
            them, and chiefly to be blamed if we do not. For though <lb/>
            the issue of war is always doubtful, this much is evident, <lb/>
            that if you succeed, you will become your country's evil <lb/>
            genius, and if you fail, you will have inflicted the <lb/>
            greatest miseries on men who are your friends and bene­ <lb/>
            factors, merely in order to gratify your own private spite."</p>
          <p>XXXVI. While Volumnia spoke thus, Marcius listened <lb/>
            to her in silence. After she had ceased, he stood for a <lb/>
            long while without speaking, until she again addressed <lb/>
            him. "Why art thou silent, my son? Is it honourable <lb/>
            to make everything give way to your rancorous hatred, <lb/>
            and is it a disgrace to yield to your mother, when she <lb/>
            pleads for such important matters? Does it become a <lb/>
            great man to remember that he has been ill treated, <lb/>
            and does it not rather become him to recollect the <lb/>
            debt which children owe to their parents. And yet no <lb/>
            one ought to be more grateful than you yourself, who <lb/>
            punish ingratitude so bitterly: in spite of which, <lb/>
            though you have already taken a deep revenge on <lb/>
            your country for its ill treatment of you, you have <lb/>
            not made your mother any return for her kindness. It <lb/>
            would have been right for me to gain my point without <lb/>
            any pressure, when pleading in such a just and honourable <lb/>
            cause; but if I cannot prevail by words, this resource <lb/>
            alone is left me." Saying this, she fell at his feet, to­ <lb/>
            gether with his wife and children. Marcius, crying out, <lb/>
            " What have you done to me, mother ?" raised her from <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            the ground, and pressing her hand violently, exclaimed, <lb/>
            " You have conquered; your victory is a blessed one for <lb/>
            Rome, but ruinous to me, for I shall retreat conquered <lb/>
            by you alone." After speaking thus, and conferring for <lb/>
            a short time in private with his mother and his wife, he <lb/>
            at their own request sent them back to Rome, and the <lb/>
            following night led away the Volscian army. Various <lb/>
            opinions were current among the Volscians about what <lb/>
            had taken place. Some blamed him severely, while <lb/>
            others approved, because they wished for peace. Others <lb/>
            again, though they disliked what he had done, yet did <lb/>
            not regard him as a traitor, but as a soft-hearted man <lb/>
            who had yielded to overwhelming pressure. However, <lb/>
            no one disobeyed him, but all followed him in his retreat, <lb/>
            though more out of regard for his noble character than <lb/>
            for his authority.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. The Roman people, when the war was at an <lb/>
            end, showed even more plainly than before what terror <lb/>
            and despair they had been in. As soon as they saw the <lb/>
            Volscians retreating from their walls, all the temples <lb/>
            were opened, and filled with worshippers crowned with <lb/>
            garlands and sacrificing as if for a victory. The joy of <lb/>
            the senate and people was most conspicuously shown in <lb/>
            their gratitude to the women, whom they spoke of as <lb/>
            having beyond all doubt saved Rome. The senate <lb/>
            decreed that the magistrates should grant to the women <lb/>
            any mark of respect and esteem which they themselves <lb/>
            might choose. The women decided on the building of thq <lb/>
            temple of Female Fortune, the expenses of which they <lb/>
            themselves offered to subscribe, only asking the state to <lb/>
            undertake the maintenance of the services in it. The <lb/>
            senate praised their public spirit, but ordered the temple <lb/>
            and shrine to be built at the public expense. Neverthe­ <lb/>
            less, the women with their own money provided a second <lb/>
            image of the goddess, which the Romans say, when it was <lb/>
            placed in the temple was heard to say, <lb/>
            " A pleasing gift have women placed me here."</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. The legend says that this voice was twice <lb/>
            heard, which seems impossible and hard for us to believe. <lb/>
            It is not impossible for statues to sweat, to shed tears, or <note type="footnote"> 2 C 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            to be covered with spots of blood, because wood and stone <lb/>
            often when mouldering or decaying, collect moisture <lb/>
            within them, and not only send it forth with many <lb/>
            colours derived from their own substance, but also receive <lb/>
            other colours from the air; and there is nothing that for­ <lb/>
            bids us to believe that by such appearances as these <lb/>
            heaven may foreshadow the future. It is also possible <lb/>
            that statues should make sounds like moaning or sighing, <lb/>
            by the tearing asunder of the particles of which they <lb/>
            are composed ; but that articulate human speech should <lb/>
            come from inanimate things is altogether impossible, for <lb/>
            neither the human soul, nor even a god can utter words <lb/>
            without a body fitted with the organs of speech. When­ <lb/>
            ever therefore we find many credible witnesses who force <lb/>
            us to believe something of this kind, we must suppose <lb/>
            that the imagination was influenced by some sensation <lb/>
            which appeared to resemble a real one, just as in dreams <lb/>
            we seem to hear when we hear not, and to see when we <lb/>
            see not. Those persons, however, who are full of religious <lb/>
            fervour and love of the gods, and who refuse to disbelieve <lb/>
            or reject anything of this kind, find in its miraculous <lb/>
            character, and in the fact that the ways of God are not as <lb/>
            our ways, a great support to their faith. For He resembles <lb/>
            mankind in nothing, neither in nature, nor movement, <lb/>
            nor learning, nor power, and so it is not to be wondered <lb/>
            at if He does what seems to us impossible. Nay, though <lb/>
            He differs from us in every respect, it is in his works <lb/>
            that He is most unlike us. But, as Herakleitus says, our <lb/>
            knowledge of things divine mostly fails for want of faith.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. When Marcius returned to Antium, Tullus, <lb/>
            who had long hated him and envied his superiority, de­ <lb/>
            termined to put him to death, thinking that if he let slip <lb/>
            the present opportunity he should not obtain another. <lb/>
            Having suborned many to bear witness against him, lie <lb/>
            called upon him publicly to render an account to the <lb/>
            Volscians of what he had done as their general. Marcius, <lb/>
            fearing to be reduced to a private station while his enemy <lb/>
            Tullus, who had great influence with his countrymen, <lb/>
            was general, answered that he had been given his office of <lb/>
            commander-in-chief by the Volscian nation, and to them <lb/>
            alone would he surrender it, but that as to an account <lb/>
             <pb n="389"/>
            of what he had done, he was ready at that moment, if <lb/>
            they chose, to render it to the people of Antium. <lb/>
            Accordingly the people assembled, and the popular orators <lb/>
            endeavoured by their speeches to excite the lower classes <lb/>
            against Marcius. When, however, he rose to speak, the <lb/>
            mob were awed to silence, while the nobility, and those <lb/>
            who had gained by the peace, made no secret of their good <lb/>
            will towards him, and of their intention to vote in his <lb/>
            favour. Under these circumstances, Tullus was unwilling <lb/>
            to let him speak, for he was a brilliant orator, and his <lb/>
            former services far outweighed his last offence. Indeed, <lb/>
            the whole indictment was a proof of how much they <lb/>
            owed him, for they never could have thought themselves <lb/>
            wronged by not taking Rome, if Marcius had not brought <lb/>
            them so near to taking it. Tullus, therefore, thought <lb/>
            that it would not do to wait, or to trust to the mob, but <lb/>
            he and the boldest of his accomplices, crying out that the <lb/>
            Volscians could not listen to the traitor, nor endure him <lb/>
            to play the despot over them by not laying down his <lb/>
            command, rushed upon him in a body and killed him, <lb/>
            without any of the bystanders interfering in his behalf. <lb/>
            However, the most part of the nation was displeased at <lb/>
            this act, as was soon proved by the numbers who came <lb/>
            from every city to see his dead body, by the splendid <lb/>
            funeral with which he was honoured, and by the arms <lb/>
            and trophies which were hung over his tomb, as that of a <lb/>
            brave man and a consummate general.</p>
          <p>The Romans, when they heard of his death, made no sign <lb/>
            of either honour or anger towards him, except that they <lb/>
            gave permission to the women, at their request, to wear <lb/>
            mourning for him for ten months, as if they were each <lb/>
            mourning for her father, her brother, or her son. This was <lb/>
            the extreme limit of the period of mourning, which was <lb/>
            fixed by Numa Pompilius, as has been related in his Life.</p>
          <p>The loss of Marcius was at once felt by the Volscians. <lb/>
            First of all, they quarrelled with the Æqui, their friends <lb/>
            and allies, and even came to blows with them; next, <lb/>
            they were defeated by the Romans in a battle in which <lb/>
            Tullus was slain, and the flower of the Volscian army <lb/>
            perished. After this disaster they were glad to surrender <lb/>
            at discretion, and become the subjects of Rome.</p>

            <title type="main">COMPARISON OF ALKIBIADES AND CORIOLANUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. As all the most memorable achievements of both <lb/>
            Alkibiades and Coriolanus are now before us, we may <lb/>
            begin our comparison by observing that as to military <lb/>
            exploits, the balance is nearly even; for both alike gave <lb/>
            proofs of great personal bravery and great skill in <lb/>
            generalship, unless it be thought that Alkibiades proved <lb/>
            himself the more perfect general because of his many <lb/>
            victories both by sea and land. Both alike obtained <lb/>
            great success for their native countries while they re­ <lb/>
            mained in command of their countrymen, and both <lb/>
            succeeded even more remarkably when fighting against <lb/>
            them. As to their respective policy, that of Alkibiades <lb/>
            was disliked by the more respectable citizens, because of <lb/>
            his personal arrogance, and the arts to which he stooped <lb/>
            to gain the favour of the lower classes; while the proud <lb/>
            ungracious haughtiness of Coriolanus caused him to be <lb/>
            hated by the people of Rome. In this respect neither of <lb/>
            them can be praised ; yet he who tries to gain the favour <lb/>
            of the people is less to blame than he who insults them <lb/>
            for fear he should be thought to court them. Although <lb/>
            it is wrong to flatter the people in order to gain power, <lb/>
            yet to owe one's power only to terror, and to ill treat and <lb/>
            keep down the masses is disgraceful as well as wrong.</p>
          <p>II. It is not difficult to see why Marcius is considered to <lb/>
            have been a simple-minded and straightforward character, <lb/>
            while Alkibiades has the reputation of a false and tricky <lb/>
            politician. The latter has been especially blamed for the <lb/>
            manner in which he deceived and outwitted the Lace­ <lb/>
            demonian ambassadors, by which, as we learn from <lb/>
            Thucydides, he brought the truce between the two <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            nations to an end. Yet that stroke of policy, though <lb/>
            it again involved Athens in war, rendered her strong <lb/>
            and formidable, through the alliance with Argos and Man­ <lb/>
            tinea, which she owed to Alkibiades. Marcius also, we <lb/>
            are told by Dionysius, produced a quarrel between the <lb/>
            Romans and the Volscians by bringing a false accusation <lb/>
            against those Volscians who came to see the festival at <lb/>
            Rome; and in this case the wickedness of his object in­ <lb/>
            creased his guilt, because he did not act from a desire of <lb/>
            personal aggrandisement, or from political rivalry, as did <lb/>
            Alkibiades, but merely yielding to what Dion calls the <lb/>
            unprofitable passion of anger, he threw a large part of <lb/>
            Italy into confusion, and in his rage against his native <lb/>
            country destroyed many innocent cities. On the other <lb/>
            hand, the anger of Alkibiades caused great misfortune to <lb/>
            his countrymen; yet as soon as he found that they had <lb/>
            relented towards him he returned cheerfully to his <lb/>
            allegiance, and after being banished for the second time, <lb/>
            did not take any delight in seeing their generals defeated, <lb/>
            and could not sit still and let them make mistakes and <lb/>
            uselessly expose themselves to danger. He did just what <lb/>
            Aristeides is so much praised for doing to Themistokles; <lb/>
            he went to the generals, although they were not his <lb/>
            friends, and pointed out to them what ought to be done.</p>
          <p>Marcius, again, is to be blamed for having made the <lb/>
            whole of Rome suffer for what only a part of it had done, <lb/>
            while the best and most important class of citizens had <lb/>
            been wronged equally with himself, and warmly sympa­ <lb/>
            thised with him. Afterwards, although his countrymen <lb/>
            sent him many embassies, beseeching his forgiveness for <lb/>
            their one act of ignorance and passion, he would not <lb/>
            listen to them, but showed that it was with the intention <lb/>
            of utterly destroying Rome, not of obtaining his own <lb/>
            restoration to it, that he had begun that terrible and <lb/>
            savage war against it. This, then, may be noted as the <lb/>
            difference between their respective positions: Alkibiades <lb/>
            went back to the Athenian side when the Spartans began <lb/>
            to plot against him, because he both feared them and <lb/>
            hated them ; but Marcius, who was in every respect well <lb/>
            treated by the Volscians, could not honourably desert <lb/>
            their cause. He had been elected their commander-in- <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            chief and besides this great power enjoyed their entire <lb/>
            confidence; while Alkibiades, though his assistance was <lb/>
            found useful by the Lacedæmonians, was never trusted <lb/>
            by them, but remained without any recognised position, <lb/>
            first in Sparta and then in the camp in Asia Minor, till <lb/>
            he finally threw himself into the arms of Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            unless, indeed, he took this step to save Athens, hoping <lb/>
            some day to be restored to her.</p>
          <p>III. As to money, Alkibiades has been blamed for <lb/>
            receiving it discreditably in bribes, and for spending it in <lb/>
            luxurious extravagance; while the generals who offered <lb/>
            Marcius money as an honourable reward for his valour <lb/>
            could not prevail upon him to accept it. This, however, <lb/>
            made him especially unpopular in the debates about <lb/>
            freeing the people from debt, because it was said that he <lb/>
            pressed so hardly on the poor, not because he wished to <lb/>
            make money by them, but purely through arrogance and <lb/>
            pride. Antipater, in a letter to a friend on the death of <lb/>
            Aristotle the philosopher, observes, “Bosides his other <lb/>
            abilities, the man had the art of persuasion." Now <lb/>
            Marcius had not this art; and its absence made all his <lb/>
            exploits and all his virtues unpleasant even to those who <lb/>
            benefited by them, as they could not endure his pride and <lb/>
            haughtiness, which brooked no compeer. Alkibiades, on <lb/>
            the other hand, knew how to deal on friendly terms with <lb/>
            every one, and we need not therefore be surprised at the <lb/>
            pleasure which men took in his successes, while even <lb/>
            some of his failures had a charm of their own for. his <lb/>
            friends. Hence it was that Alkibiades, even after inflicting <lb/>
            many grievous losses upon his countrymen, was chosen by <lb/>
            them as commander-in-chief, whereas Marcius, when after <lb/>
            a splendid display of courage and conduct he tried for the <lb/>
            consulship which he deserved, failed to obtain it. The <lb/>
            one could not be hated by his countrymen, even when <lb/>
            they were ill treated by him; while the other, though <lb/>
            admired by all, was loved by none.</p>
          <p>IV. Marcius, indeed, effected nothing great when in <lb/>
            command of his own countrymen, but only when fighting <lb/>
            against them, whereas the Athenians frequently benefited <lb/>
            by the successes of Alkibiades, when he was acting as their <lb/>
            oummauder-in-chief. Alkibiades when present easily <lb/>
             <pb n="393"/>
            triumphed over his enemies, whereas Marcius, although <lb/>
            present, was condemned by the Romans, and put to death <lb/>
            by the Volscians. Moreover, though he was wrongfully <lb/>
            slain, yet he himself furnished his enemies with a pretext <lb/>
            for his murder, by refusing the public offer of peace made <lb/>
            by the Romans, and then yielding to the private entreaties <lb/>
            of his mother and wife, so that he did not put an end to <lb/>
            the enmity between the two nations, but left them at war, <lb/>
            and yet lost a favourable opportunity for the Volscians.</p>
          <p>If he was influenced by a feeling of duty towards the <lb/>
            Volscians, he ought to have obtained their consent before <lb/>
            withdrawing their forces from before Rome; but if he <lb/>
            cared nothing for them, or for anything except the grati­ <lb/>
            fication of his own passion, and with this feeling made <lb/>
            war upon his country, and only paused in the moment of <lb/>
            victory, it was not creditable to him to spare his country <lb/>
            for his mother's sake, but rather he should have spared <lb/>
            his country and his mother with it; for his mother and <lb/>
            his wife were but a part of Rome, which he was besieging. <lb/>
            That he should have treated the public supplications of <lb/>
            ambassadors and the prayers of priests with contempt, <lb/>
            and afterwards have drawn off his forces to please his <lb/>
            mother, is not so much a credit to her as a disgrace to his <lb/>
            country, which was saved by the tears and entreaties of <lb/>
            one woman, as though it did not deserve to survive on its <lb/>
            own merits. The mercy which he showed the Romans <lb/>
            was so harshly and offensively granted that it pleased <lb/>
            neither party; he withdrew his forces without having <lb/>
            either having come to an understanding with his friends <lb/>
            or his foes. All this must be attributed to his haughty, <lb/>
            unbending temper, which is in all cases odious, but which <lb/>
            in an ambitious man renders him savage and inexorable, <lb/>
            Such men will not seek for popularity, thinking them­ <lb/>
            selves already sufficiently distinguished, and then are <lb/>
            angry at finding themselves unpopular.</p>
          <p>Indeed, neither Metellus, nor Aristeides, nor Epamei­ <lb/>
            nondas would stoop to court the favour of the people, and <lb/>
            had a thorough contempt for all that the people can either <lb/>
            give or take away; yet although they were often ostracised, <lb/>
            convicted, and condemned to pay fines, they were not <lb/>
            angry with their fellow countrymen for their folly, but <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            came back and became reconciled to them as soon as they <lb/>
            repented. The man who will not court the people, ought <lb/>
            least of all to bear malice against them, reflecting that <lb/>
            anger at not being elected to an office in the state, must <lb/>
            spring from an excessive desire to obtain it.</p>
          <p>V. Alkibiades made no secret of his delight in being <lb/>
            honoured and his vexation when slighted, and in con­ <lb/>
            sequence endeavoured to make himself acceptable to all <lb/>
            with whom he had to do. Marcius was prevented by his <lb/>
            pride from courting those who could have bestowed honour <lb/>
            and advancement upon him, while his ambition tortured <lb/>
            him if these were withheld.</p>
          <p>These are the points which we find to blame in his <lb/>
            character, which in all other respects was a noble one. <lb/>
            With regard to temperance, and contempt for money, <lb/>
            he may be compared with the greatest and purest men <lb/>
            of Greece, not merely with Alkibiades, who cared only <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>IT was for the sake of others that I first undertook to <lb/>
            write biographies, but I soon began to dwell upon and <lb/>
            delight in them for myself, endeavouring to the best of my <lb/>
            ability to regulate my own life, and to make it like that of <lb/>
            those who were reflected in their history as it were in a <lb/>
            mirror before me. By the study of their biographies, we <lb/>
            receive each man as a guest into our minds, and we seem <lb/>
            to understand their character as the result of a personal <lb/>
            acquaintance, because we have obtained from their acts <lb/>
            the best and most important means of forming an opinion <lb/>
            about them. " What greater pleasure could'st thou gain <lb/>
            than this?" What more valuable for the elevation of our <lb/>
            own character ? Demokritus says, that we ought to pray <lb/>
            that we may meet with propitious phantasms, and that <lb/>
            from the infinite space which surrounds us good and con­ <lb/>
            genial phantasms, rather than base and sinister ones, may <lb/>
            be brought into contact with us. He degrades philosophy <lb/>
            by foisting into it a theory which is untrue, and which leads <lb/>
            to unbounded superstition; whereas we, by our familiarity <lb/>
            with history, and habit of writing it, so train ourselves by <lb/>
            constantly receiving into our minds the memorials of the <lb/>
            great and good, that should anything base or vicious be <lb/>
            placed in our way by the society into which we are neces­ <lb/>
            sarily thrown, we reject it and expel it from our thoughts, <lb/>
            by fixing them calmly and severely on some of these great <lb/>
            examples. Of these, I have chosen for you in this present <lb/>
            instance, the life of Timoleon the Corinthian, and that of <lb/>
            Æmilius Paulus, men who both laid their plans with skill, <lb/>
            and carried them out with good fortune, so as to raise a <lb/>
            question whether it was more by good luck or by good sense <lb/>
            that they succeeded in their most important achievements.</p>
          <p>I. The state of affairs at Syracuse, before the mission of <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            Timoleon to Sicily, was this. Dion had driven out the <lb/>
            despot. Dionysius, but was immediately afterwards slain <lb/>
            by treachery, and those who, under Dion, had freed the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, quarrelled amongst themselves. The city, which <lb/>
            received a constant succession of despots, was almost for­ <lb/>
            saken because of its many troubles. Of the rest of Sicily, <lb/>
            one part was rendered quite ruined and uninhabited by <lb/>
            the wars, and most of the cities were held by barbarians <lb/>
            of various nations, and soldiers who were under no pay­ <lb/>
            master. As these men willingly lent their aid to effect <lb/>
            changes of dynasty, Dionysius, in the twelfth year of his <lb/>
            exile, collected a body of foreign troops, drove out Nysaeus, <lb/>
            the then ruler of Syracuse, again restored his empire, and <lb/>
            was re-established as despot. He had strangely lost the <lb/>
            greatest known empire at the hands of a few men, and <lb/>
            more strangely still became again the lord of those who <lb/>
            had driven him out, after having been an exile and a <lb/>
            beggar. Those then of the Syracusans who remained in <lb/>
            the city were the. subjects of a despot not naturally <lb/>
            humane, and whose heart now had been embittered by <lb/>
            misfortune: t but the better class of citizens and the men <lb/>
            of note fled to Hiketes, the ruler of Leontini, swore alle­ <lb/>
            giance to him, and chose him as their general for the war. <lb/>
            This man was nowise better than the avowed despots, <lb/>
            but they had no other resource, and they trusted him <lb/>
            because he was a Syracusan by birth, and had a force <lb/>
            capable of encountering that of their own despot.</p>
          <p>II. Meanwhile the Carthaginians came to Sicily with a <lb/>
            great fleet, and were hovering off the island watching their <lb/>
            opportunity. The Sicilians in terror wished to send an <lb/>
            embassy to Greece, and ask for help from the Corinthians, <lb/>
            not merely on account of their kinship with them, and of <lb/>
            the, many kindnesses which they had received from them, <lb/>
            but also because they saw that the whole city loved free­ <lb/>
            dom, and hated despots, and that it had waged its greatest <lb/>
            and most important wars, not for supremacy and greed of <lb/>
            power, but on behalf of the liberty of Greece. But Hiketes <lb/>
            who had obtained his post of commander-in-chief with a <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύραννος</foreign>, here and elsewhere translated despot, means a man <lb/>
            who had obtained irresponsible power by unconstitutional means, </note><note type="footnote"> t Compare Tacitus, eo immitior quia toleraverat." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            view, not to the liberation of Syracuse, but the establish­ <lb/>
            ment of himself as despot there, had already had secret <lb/>
            negotiations with the Carthaginians, though in public he <lb/>
            commended the Syracusans, and sent ambassadors of his <lb/>
            own with the rest to Peloponnesus: not that he wished that <lb/>
            any assistance should come thence, but, in case the Corin­ <lb/>
            thians, as was probable, should refuse their help because of <lb/>
            the disturbed state of Greece, he hoped that he should <lb/>
            more easily be able to bring matters round to suit the Car­ <lb/>
            thaginian interest, and to use them as allies either against <lb/>
            the Syracusan citizens, or against their despot. Of this <lb/>
            treacherous design he was shortly afterwards convicted.</p>
          <p>III. When the ambassadors arrived, the Corinthians, <lb/>
            who had always been in the habit of watching over the <lb/>
            interests of their colonies, especially Syracuse, and who were <lb/>
            not at war with any of the Greek States at that time, but <lb/>
            living in peace and leisure, eagerly voted to help them. <lb/>
            A General was now sought for, and while the government <lb/>
            was nominating and proposing those who were eager for <lb/>
            an opportunity of distinguishing themselves, a man of the <lb/>
            people stood up and named Timoleon, the son of Timo­ <lb/>
            demus, one who no longer took any part in politics, and <lb/>
            who had no hope or thought of obtaining the post: but <lb/>
            some god, it seems, put it into the man's mind to name <lb/>
            him, such a kind fortune was at once shown at his election, <lb/>
            and such success attended his actions, illustrating his <lb/>
            noble character. He was of a good family, both his father <lb/>
            Timodemus, and his mother Demariste being of rank in <lb/>
            the city. He was a lover of his country, and of a mild <lb/>
            temper, except only that he had a violent hatred for des­ <lb/>
            potism and all that is base. His nature was so happily <lb/>
            constituted, that in his campaigns he showed much judg­ <lb/>
            ment when young, and no less daring when old. He had <lb/>
            an elder brother, Timophanes, who was in no respect like <lb/>
            him, but rash, and inflamed with a passion for monarchy <lb/>
            by worthless friends and foreign soldiers, with whom he <lb/>
            spent all his time: he was reckless in a campaign, and <lb/>
            loved danger for its own sake, and by this he won the <lb/>
            hearts of his fellow-citizens, and was given commands, as <lb/>
            being a man of courage and of action. Timoleon assisted <lb/>
            him in obtaining these commands, by concealing his faults <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            or making them appear small, and by magnifying the <lb/>
            clever things which he did.</p>
          <p>IV. Now in the battle which the Corinthians fought <lb/>
            against the Argives and Kleoneans, Timoleon was ranked <lb/>
            among the hoplites,* and his brother Timophanes, who was <lb/>
            in command of the cavalry, fell into great danger. His <lb/>
            horse received a wound, and threw him off among the <lb/>
            enemy. Of his companions, some at once dispersed in <lb/>
            panic, while those who remained by him, being a few <lb/>
            against many, with difficulty held their own. When <lb/>
            Timoleon saw what had happened, he ran to the rescue, <lb/>
            and held his shield in front of Timophanes as he lay, and, <lb/>
            after receiving many blows, both from missiles and in <lb/>
            hand-to-hand fight, on his arms and body, with difficulty <lb/>
            drove back the enemy and saved his brother.</p>
          <p>When the Corinthians, fearing lest they might again <lb/>
            suffer what they did once before when their own allies took <lb/>
            their city, decreed that they would keep four hundred mer­ <lb/>
            cenary soldiers, they made Timophanes their commander.</p>
          <p>But he, disdaining truth and honour, immediately took <lb/>
            measures to get the city into his own power, and showed <lb/>
            his tyrannical disposition by putting to death many <lb/>
            of the leading citizens without a trial. Timoleon was <lb/>
            grieved at this, and, treating the other's crime as his own <lb/>
            misfortune, endeavoured to argue with him, and begged <lb/>
            him to abandon his foolish and wicked design, and to seek <lb/>
            for some means of making amends to his fellow-citizens. <lb/>
            However, as he rejected his brother's advice, and treated <lb/>
            him with contempt, Timoleon took Æschylus, his kinsman, <lb/>
            brother of the wife of Timophanes, and his friend the <lb/>
            seer, whom Theopompus calls Satyrus, but Ephorus and <lb/>
            Timæus call Orthagoras, and, after an interval of a few <lb/>
            days, again went to his brother. The three men now <lb/>
            stood round him, and besought him even now to listen to <lb/>
            reason, and repent of his ambition ; but as Timophanes <lb/>
            at first laughed at them, and then became angry and in­ <lb/>
            dignant, Timoleon stepped a little aside, and covering his <lb/>
            face, stood weeping, while the other two drew their swords <lb/>
            and quickly despatched him.</p>
          <p>V. When this deed was noised abroad, the more generous <note type="footnote"> *Heavy armed foot-soldiers, carrying a spear and shield. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            of the Corinthians praised Timoleon for his abhorrence <lb/>
            of wickedness and his greatness of soul, because, though <lb/>
            of a kindly disposition, and fond of his own family, lie <lb/>
            had nevertheless preferred his country to his family, and <lb/>
            truth and justice to his own advantage. He had distin­ <lb/>
            guished himself in his country's cause both by saving his <lb/>
            brother's life, and by putting him to death when he plotted <lb/>
            to reduce her to slavery. However, those who could not <lb/>
            endure to live in a democracy, and who were accustomed <lb/>
            to look up to those in power, pretended to rejoice in the <lb/>
            death of the tyrant, but by their abuse of Timoleon for <lb/>
            having done an unholy and impious deed, reduced him <lb/>
            to a state of great melancholy. Hearing that his mother <lb/>
            took it greatly to heart and that she used harsh words <lb/>
            and invoked terrible curses upon him, he went to her to <lb/>
            try to bring her to another state of mind, but she would <lb/>
            not endure the sight of him, but shut the door against <lb/>
            him. Then indeed he became very dejected, and disordered <lb/>
            in his mind, so as to form an intention of destroying him­ <lb/>
            self by starvation; but this his friends would not permit, <lb/>
            but prevailed on him by force and entreaty so that he <lb/>
            determined to live, but alone by himself. He gave up all <lb/>
            interest in public affairs, and at first did not even enter <lb/>
            the city, but passed his time wandering in the wildest <lb/>
            part of the country in an agony of mind.</p>
          <p>VI. Thus our judgments, if they do not borrow from <lb/>
            reason and philosophy a fixity and steadiness of pur­ <lb/>
            pose in their acts, are easily swayed and influenced by <lb/>
            the praise or blame of others, which make us distrust our <lb/>
            own opinions.</p>
          <p>For not only, it seems, must the deed itself be noble <lb/>
            and just, but also the principle from which we do it must <lb/>
            be stable and unchangeable, so that we may make up our <lb/>
            minds and then act from conviction. If we do not, then <lb/>
            like those epicures who most eagerly seize upon the <lb/>
            daintiest food and soonest become satiated and nauseate it, <lb/>
            so we become filled with sorrow and remorse when the <lb/>
            deed is done, because the splendid ideas of virtue and <lb/>
            honour which led us to do it fade away in our minds on <lb/>
            account of our own moral weakness. A remorseful change <lb/>
            of mind renders even a noble action base, whereas the <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            determination which is grounded on knowledge and <lb/>
            reason cannot change even if its actions fail. Wherefore <lb/>
            Phokion the Athenian, who opposed the measures of <lb/>
            Leosthenes, when Leosthenes seemed to have succeeded, <lb/>
            and he saw the Athenians sacrificing and priding them­ <lb/>
            selves on their victory, said that he should have wished <lb/>
            that he had himself done what had been done, but he <lb/>
            should wish to have given the same counsel that he did <lb/>
            give. Aristeides the Lokrian, one of the companions of <lb/>
            Plato, put this even more strongly when Dionysius the <lb/>
            elder asked for one of his daughters in marriage. “I had <lb/>
            rather," he said, “ see the girl a corpse, than the- consort <lb/>
            of a despot." A short time afterwards when Dionysius <lb/>
            put his sons to death and insultingly asked him whether <lb/>
            he were still of the same mind about the disposal of his <lb/>
            daughter, he answered, that he was grieved at what had <lb/>
            happened, but had not changed his mind about what he <lb/>
            had said. And these words perhaps show a greater and <lb/>
            more perfect virtue than Phokion's.</p>
          <p>VII. Now Timoleon's misery, after the deed was done, <lb/>
            whether it was caused by pity for the dead or filial <lb/>
            reverence for his mother, so broke down and humbled his <lb/>
            spirit that for nearly twenty years he took no part in any <lb/>
            important public affair. So when he was nominated as <lb/>
            General, and when the people gladly received his name <lb/>
            and elected him, Telekleides, who at that time was the <lb/>
            first man in the city for power and reputation, stood up <lb/>
            and spoke encouragingly to Timoleon, bidding him prove <lb/>
            himself brave and noble in the campaign.. “ If," said <lb/>
            he, you fight well, we shall think that we slew a tyrant, <lb/>
            but if badly, that we murdered your brother."</p>
          <p>While Timoleon was preparing for his voyage and <lb/>
            collecting his soldiers, letters were brought to the <lb/>
            Corinthians from Hiketes plainly showing that he had <lb/>
            changed sides and betrayed them.</p>
          <p>For as soon as he had sent off his ambassadors to <lb/>
            Corinth, he openly joined the Carthaginians, and in concert <lb/>
            with them attempted to drive out Dionysius and establish <lb/>
            himself as despot of Syracuse. <note type="footnote"> * From these words, Grote conjectures that Telekleides was also <lb/>
            present at the death of Timoplianes. </note></p><pb n="401"/>
            
          <p>Fearing that the opportunity would escape him if an <lb/>
            army and general came from Corinth before he had <lb/>
            succeeded, he sent a letter to the Corinthians to say that <lb/>
            they need not incur the trouble and expense of sending <lb/>
            an expedition to Sicily and risking their lives, espe­ <lb/>
            cially as the Carthaginians would dispute their passage, <lb/>
            and were now watching for their expedition with a <lb/>
            numerous fleet; and that, as they bad been so slow, he <lb/>
            should be obliged to make these Carthaginians his allies <lb/>
            to attack the despot.</p>
          <p>When these letters were read, even if any of the <lb/>
            Corinthians had been lukewarm about the expedition, <lb/>
            now their anger against Hiketes stirred them up to <lb/>
            co-operate vigorously with Timoleon and assist him in <lb/>
            equipping his force.</p>
          <p>VIII. When the ships were ready, and everything had <lb/>
            been provided for the soldiers, the priestesses of Proserpine <lb/>
            had a dream that the two goddesses appeared dressed for <lb/>
            a journey, and said that they were going to accompany <lb/>
            Timoleon on his voyage to Sicily.</p>
          <p>Hereupon the Corinthians equipped a sacred trireme, <lb/>
            and named it after the two goddesses. Timoleon himself <lb/>
            proceeded to Delphi and sacrificed to the god, and when <lb/>
            he came into the place where oracles were delivered, a <lb/>
            portent occurred to him. From among the various offer­ <lb/>
            ings suspended there, a victor's wreath, embroidered with <lb/>
            crowns and symbols of victory slipped down and was <lb/>
            carried by the air so as to alight upon the head of Timo­ <lb/>
            leon ; so that it appeared that the god sent him forth to <lb/>
            his campaign already crowned with success. He started <lb/>
            with only seven ships from Corinth, two from Korkyra, <lb/>
            and one from Leukadia; and as he put to sea at night <lb/>
            and was sailing with a fair wind, he suddenly saw the <lb/>
            heavens open above his ship and pour down a flood of <lb/>
            brilliant light. After this a torch like that used at the <lb/>
            mysteries rose up before them, and, proceeding on the <lb/>
            same course, alighted on that part of Italy for which <lb/>
            the pilots were steering. The seers explained that this <lb/>
            appearance corroborated the dream of the priestesses, anti <lb/>
            that the light from heaven showed that the two god­ <lb/>
            desses were joining the expedition; for Sicily is sacred to <note type="footnote"> 2 D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            Proserpine, as the myth tells us that she was carried off <lb/>
            there, and that the island itself was given her as a <lb/>
            wedding present.</p>
          <p>The fleet, encouraged by these proofs of divine favour, <lb/>
            crossed the open sea, and proceeded along the Italian coast. <lb/>
            But the news from Sicily gave Timoleon much concern, <lb/>
            and dispirited his soldiers. For Hiketes had conquered <lb/>
            Dionysius, and taken the greater part of Syracuse; he had <lb/>
            driven him into the citadel and what is called the island, <lb/>
            and was besieging and blockading him there, and urging <lb/>
            the Carthaginians to take measures to prevent Timoleon <lb/>
            from landing in Sicily, in order that, when the Greeks <lb/>
            were driven off, he and his new allies might partition the <lb/>
            island between themselves.</p>
          <p>IX. The Carthaginians sent twenty triremes to Rhegium, <lb/>
            having on board ambassadors from Hiketes to Timoleon <lb/>
            charged with instructions as bad as his deeds. For their <lb/>
            proposals were plausible, though their plan was base, <lb/>
            being that Timoleon, if he chose, should come as an <lb/>
            adviser to Hiketes and partake of his conquests; but that <lb/>
            he should send his ships and soldiers back to Corinth, as <lb/>
            the war was within a little of being finished, and as the <lb/>
            Carthaginians were determined to oppose his passage by <lb/>
            force if he attempted it. So the Corinthians, when they <lb/>
            reached Rhegium, found these ambassadors, and saw the <lb/>
            Carthaginian fleet cruising to intercept them. They <lb/>
            were enraged at this treatment, and all were filled with <lb/>
            anger against Hiketes, and with fear for the people of <lb/>
            Sicily, who, they clearly saw, were to be the prize of the <lb/>
            treachery of Hiketes and the ambition of the Carthaginians. <lb/>
            Yet it seemed impossible that they should overcome both <lb/>
            the fleet of the barbarians which was riding there, double <lb/>
            their own in number, and also the forces under Hiketes <lb/>
            at Syracuse, of which they had expected to be put in <lb/>
            command.</p>
          <p>X. Nevertheless Timoleon met the ambassadors and the <lb/>
            Carthaginian admirals, and mildly informed them that <lb/>
            “ he would accede to their proposals, for what could he do <lb/>
            if he refused them? but that he wished, before they <lb/>
            parted, to listen to them, and to answer them publicly <lb/>
            before the people of Rhegium, a city of Greek origin and <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            friendly to both parties; as this would conduce to his own <lb/>
            safety, and they also would be the more bound to stand <lb/>
            by their proposal about the Syracusans if they took the <lb/>
            people of Rhegium as their witnesses." He made this <lb/>
            overture to help a plot which he had of stealing a march <lb/>
            upon them, and the leading men of the Rhegines assisted <lb/>
            him in it, as they wished the Corinthian influence to <lb/>
            prevail in Sicily, and feared to have the barbarians for <lb/>
            neighbours. Accordingly they called together an assembly <lb/>
            and shut the city gates, that the citizens might not attend <lb/>
            to anything else, and then, coming forward, they made <lb/>
            speeches of great length, one man treating the subject <lb/>
            after another without coming to any conclusion, but <lb/>
            merely wasting the time, until the Corinthian triremes <lb/>
            had put to sea. The Carthaginians were kept at the <lb/>
            assembly without suspecting anything, because Timoleon <lb/>
            himself was present and gave them to understand that he <lb/>
            was just upon the point of rising and making them a <lb/>
            speech. But when news was secretly conveyed to him <lb/>
            that the fleet was under way, and that his ship alone was <lb/>
            left behind waiting for him, he slipped through the crowd, <lb/>
            the Rhegines who stood round the bema* helping to <lb/>
            conceal him, and, gaining the seashore, sailed off with all <lb/>
            haste.</p>
          <p>They reached Tauromenium in Sicily, where they were <lb/>
            hospitably received by Andromachus, the ruler and lord <lb/>
            of that city, who had long before invited them thither. <lb/>
            This Andromachus was the father of Timaeus, the his­ <lb/>
            torian, and being as he was by far the most powerful of <lb/>
            the legitimate princes of Sicily, ruled his subjects accord­ <lb/>
            ing to law and justice, and never concealed his dislike and <lb/>
            hatred of the despots. For this reason he permitted <lb/>
            Timoleon to make his city his headquarters, and prevailed <lb/>
            on the citizens to cast in their lot with the Syracusans <lb/>
            and free their native land.</p>
          <p>XI. At Rhegium meanwhile, the Carthaginians, when <lb/>
            the assembly broke up and Timolcon was gone, were in­ <lb/>
            furiated at being outwitted, and became a standing joke <lb/>
            to the people of Rhegium, because they, although they <lb/>
            were Phoenicians, yet did not seem to enjoy a piece of <note type="footnote"> 0 Bema, the tribune from which the orators spoke. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            deceit when it was at their own expense. They then <lb/>
            sent an ambassador in a trireme to Tauromenium, who <lb/>
            made a long speech to Andromachus, threatening him in <lb/>
            a bombastic and barbarian style with their vengeance if <lb/>
            he did not at once turn the Corinthians out of his city. <lb/>
            At last he pointed to his outstretched hand, and turning <lb/>
            it over threatened that he would so deal with the city. <lb/>
            Andromachus laughed, and made no other answer than <lb/>
            to hold out his own hand in the same way, now with one <lb/>
            side up, and now with the other, and bade him sail <lb/>
            away unless he wished to have his ship so dealt with.</p>
          <p>Hiketes, when he heard of Timoleon's arrival, in his <lb/>
            terror sent for many of the Carthaginian ships of war; <lb/>
            and now the Syracusans began utterly to despair of their <lb/>
            safety, seeing the Carthaginians in possession of the <lb/>
            harbour, Hiketes holding the city, and Dionysius still <lb/>
            master of the promontory, while Timoleon was as it were <lb/>
            hanging on the outskirts of Sicily in that little fortress of <lb/>
            Tauromenium, with but little hope and a weak force, for <lb/>
            he had no more than one thousand soldiers and the <lb/>
            necessary supplies for them. Nor had the cities of Sicily <lb/>
            any trust in him, as they were in great distress, and <lb/>
            greatly exasperated against those who pretended to lead <lb/>
            armies to their succour, on account of the treachery of <lb/>
            Kallippus and Pharax; who, one an Athenian and the <lb/>
            other a Lacedæmonian, but both giving out that they <lb/>
            were come to fight for freedom and to put down despotism, <lb/>
            did so tyrannise themselves, that the reign of the despots <lb/>
            in Sicily seemed to have been a golden age, and those <lb/>
            who died in slavery were thought more happy than those <lb/>
            who lived to see liberty.</p>
          <p>XII. So thinking that the Corinthian would be no <lb/>
            better than these men, and that the same plausible and <lb/>
            specious baits would be held out to lure them with hopes <lb/>
            and pleasant promises under the yoke of a new master, <lb/>
            they all viewed the proposals of the Corinthians with <lb/>
            suspicion and shrank back from them except the Adranites. <lb/>
            These were the inhabitants of a small city, sacred to <lb/>
            Adranus, a god whose worship extends especially through­ <lb/>
            out Sicily. They were at feud with one another, as one <lb/>
            party invited Hiketes and the Carthaginians, while the <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            other sent for Timoleon to help them. And by some <lb/>
            chance it happened that as each party strove to get there <lb/>
            first, they both arrived at the same time; Hiketes with <lb/>
            five thousand soldiers, whereas Timoleon altogether had <lb/>
            no more than twelve hundred.</p>
          <p>Starting with these men from Tauromenium, which is <lb/>
            forty-two miles from Adranum, he made but a short <lb/>
            march on the first day, and then encamped. On the next <lb/>
            day he marched steadily forward, passed some difficult <lb/>
            country, and late in the day heard that Hiketas had just <lb/>
            reached the little fortress and was encamping before it. <lb/>
            On this the officers halted the van of the army, thinking <lb/>
            that the men would be fresher after taking food and rest; <lb/>
            but Timoleon went to them and begged them not to do so, <lb/>
            but to lead them on as fast as they could, and fall upon <lb/>
            the enemy while they were in disorder, as it was probable <lb/>
            they would be, having just come off their march, and <lb/>
            being busy about pitching their tents, and cooking their <lb/>
            supper. Saying this he seized his shield,* and led the <lb/>
            way himself as to an assured victory; and the rest, <lb/>
            reassured, followed him confidently. They were distant <lb/>
            only about thirty furlongs. These were soon passed, and <lb/>
            they fell headlong upon the enemy, who were in confusion, <lb/>
            and fled as soon as they discovered their attack. For this <lb/>
            reason no more than three hundred of them were slain, but <lb/>
            twice as many were taken prisoners, and their camp was <lb/>
            captured. The people of Adranum now opened their <lb/>
            gates, and made their submission to Timoleon, relating <lb/>
            with awe and wonder how, at the outset of the battle, the <lb/>
            sacred doors of the temple flew open of their own accord, <lb/>
            and the spear of the god was seen to quiver at the point, <lb/>
            while his face was covered with a thick sweat.</p>
          <p>XIII. These portents, it seems, did not merely presage <lb/>
            the victory, but also the subsequent events, of which <lb/>
            this was the prosperous beginning. Immediately several <lb/>
            cities sent ambassadors and joined Timoleon, as did also <lb/>
            Mamercus the despot of Katana, a man of warlike tastes <lb/>
            and great wealth, who made an alliance with him. But <lb/>
            the most important thing of all was that Dionysius <note type="footnote"> * The shield of a General was habitually carried for him by an <lb/>
            orderly. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            himself, who had now lost all hope of success, and was on <lb/>
            the point of being starved out, despising Hiketes for being <lb/>
            so shamefully beaten, but admiring Timoleon, sent to him <lb/>
            and offered to deliver up both himself and the citadel to <lb/>
            the Corinthians.</p>
          <p>Timoleon, accepting this unexpected piece of good <lb/>
            fortune, sent Eukleides and Telemachus, Corinthian <lb/>
            officers, into the citadel, and four hundred men besides, not <lb/>
            all together nor openly, for that was impossible in the <lb/>
            face of the enemy, who were blockading it, but by stealth, <lb/>
            and in small bodies. So these soldiers took possession of <lb/>
            the citadel, and the palace with all its furniture, and all <lb/>
            the military stores. There were a good many horses, and <lb/>
            every species of artillery and missile weapon. Also there <lb/>
            were arms and armour for seventy thousand men, which <lb/>
            had been stored up there for a long time, and Dionysius <lb/>
            also had two thousand soldiers, all of whom he handed <lb/>
            over to Timoleon with the rest of the fortress, and then, <lb/>
            with his money and a few of his friends, he put to sea, <lb/>
            and passed unnoticed through Hiketes's cruisers. He pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to the camp of Timoleon, appearing for the first <lb/>
            time as a private person in great humility, and was sent <lb/>
            to Corinth in one ship, and with a small allowance of <lb/>
            money. He had been born and bred in the most splendid <lb/>
            and greatest of empires, and had reigned over it for ten <lb/>
            years, but for twelve more, since the time that Dion <lb/>
            attacked him, he had constantly been in troubles and wars, <lb/>
            during which all the cruelties which he had exercised on <lb/>
            others, were more than avenged upon himself, by the <lb/>
            miserable death of his wife and family, which are more <lb/>
            particularly dwelt upon in the life of Dion.</p>
          <p>XIV. Now when Dionysius reached Corinth, there was <lb/>
            no one in Greece who did not wish to see him and speak to <lb/>
            him. Some, who rejoiced in his misfortunes, came to see <lb/>
            him out of hatred, in order to trample on him now that <lb/>
            he was down, while others sympathised with him in his <lb/>
            change of fortune, reflecting on the inscrutable ways of <lb/>
            the gods, and the uncertainty of human affairs. For that <lb/>
            age produced nothing in nature or art so remarkable as <lb/>
            that change of fortune which showed the man, who not <lb/>
            long before had been supreme ruler of Sicily, now dining <lb/>
             <pb n="407"/>
            at Corinth at the cook's shop, lounging at the perfumer's, <lb/>
            drinking at the taverns, instructing female singers, and <lb/>
            carefully arguing with them about their songs in the <lb/>
            theatre, and about the laws of music. Some thought that <lb/>
            Dionysius acted thus from folly, and indolent love of <lb/>
            pleasure, but others considered that it was in order that he <lb/>
            might be looked down upon, and not be an object of terror <lb/>
            or suspicion to the Corinthians, as he would have been if <lb/>
            they thought that he ill brooked his reverse of fortune, and <lb/>
            still nourished ambitious designs, and that his foolish and <lb/>
            licentious mode of life was thus to be accounted for.</p>
          <p>XV. But for all that, certain of his sayings are remem­ <lb/>
            bered, which sufficiently prove that he showed real great­ <lb/>
            ness of mind in adapting himself to his altered circum­ <lb/>
            stances. When he arrived at Leukas, which, like Syra­ <lb/>
            cuse, was a Corinthian colony, he said that he was like a <lb/>
            young man who has got into disgrace. They associate <lb/>
            gaily with their brothers, but are ashamed to meet their <lb/>
            fathers, and avoid them : and so he was ashamed to go to <lb/>
            the parent city, but would gladly live there with them. <lb/>
            Another time in Corinth, when some stranger coarsely <lb/>
            jeered at the philosophic studies in which he used to <lb/>
            delight when in power, and at last asked him what good <lb/>
            he had obtained from the wisdom of Plato, “ Do you <lb/>
            think," answered he, “ that I have gained nothing from <lb/>
            Plato, when I bear my reverse of fortune as I do." When <lb/>
            Aristoxenus, the musician, and some others asked him what <lb/>
            fault he had found with Plato, and why, he answered that <lb/>
            absolute power, amongst its many evils, was especially <lb/>
            unfortunate in this, that none of a despot's so-called friends <lb/>
            dare to speak their mind openly. And he himself, he said, <lb/>
            had been by such men deprived of the friendship of Plato. <lb/>
            A man, who thought himself witty, once tried to make a <lb/>
            joke of Dionysius by shaking out his cloak, when he came <lb/>
            into his presence, as is the custom before despots, to show <lb/>
            that one has no concealed weapons ; but he repaid the jest <lb/>
            by begging him to do it when he left him, that he might <lb/>
            be sure that he had not stolen any of his property.</p>
          <p>Philip of Macedon once, when they were drinking to­ <lb/>
            gether, made some sneering remark about the poetry and <lb/>
            tragedies which Dionysius the elder had written, pretend­ <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            ing to be at a loss to know how he found time for such <lb/>
            pursuits; but Dionysius cleverly answered, “ He wrote <lb/>
            them during the time which you and I, and all who are <lb/>
            thought such lucky fellows, spend over our wine."</p>
          <p>Plato never saw Dionysius at Corinth, for he was <lb/>
            dead at that time; but Diogenes of Sinope, when he first <lb/>
            met him, said, “ How unworthily you live, Dionysius." <lb/>
            Dionysius answered him, “ Thank you, Diogenes, for <lb/>
            sympathising with my misfortunes." " Why," said Dio­ <lb/>
            genes ; " do you suppose that I sympathise with you, and <lb/>
            am not rather grieved that a slave like you, a man fit, like <lb/>
            your father, to grow old and die on a miserable throne, <lb/>
            should be living in luxury and enjoyment amongst us ? " <lb/>
            So, when I compare with these sayings of his the lamen­ <lb/>
            tations which Philistius pours forth over the daughters <lb/>
            of Leptines, that they had fallen from the glories of <lb/>
            sovereign power into a humble station, they seem to me <lb/>
            like the complainings of a woman who has lost her per­ <lb/>
            fumes, her purple dresses or her jewels.</p>
          <p>These details, I think, for readers who are at leisure, <lb/>
            are not foreign to the design of biography, and not with­ <lb/>
            out value.</p>
          <p>XVI. If the fall of Dionysius seems strange, the good <lb/>
            fortune of Timoleon was no less wonderful. Within fifty <lb/>
            days of his landing in Sicily, he was master of the citadel <lb/>
            of Syracuse, and sent back Dionysius to Peloponnesus. <lb/>
            Encouraged by his success, the Corinthians sent him a <lb/>
            reinforcement of two thousand hoplites and two hundred <lb/>
            horse. These men reached Thurii, but there found it im­ <lb/>
            possible to cross over into Sicily, as the Carthaginians <lb/>
            held the sea with a great fleet. As it was necessary for <lb/>
            them to remain there for a time, they made use of their <lb/>
            leisure to perform a most excellent action. For the <lb/>
            Thurians made an expedition against the Bruttii,* and <lb/>
            meanwhile these men took charge of their city, and guarded <lb/>
            it carefully and trustily as if it had been their own.</p>
          <p>Hiketes meanwhile was besieging the citadel of Syracuse, <lb/>
            and preventing corn from being brought by sea to the <lb/>
            Corinthians. He also obtained two strangers, whom he sent <lb/>
            to assassinate Timoleon, who, trusting in the favour shown <note type="footnote"> * The natives of Southern Italy. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            him by the gods, was living carelessly and unsuspectingly <lb/>
            among the people of Adranum. These men, hearing that <lb/>
            he was about to offer sacrifice, came into the temple with <lb/>
            daggers under their cloaks, and mingling with the crowd <lb/>
            round the altar, kept edging towards him. They were <lb/>
            just on the point of arranging their attack, when a man <lb/>
            struck one of them on the head with his sword, and he <lb/>
            fell. Neither the assailant nor the accomplice of the <lb/>
            fallen man stood his ground, but the one with his sword <lb/>
            still in his hand ran and took refuge on a high rock, while <lb/>
            the other laid hold of the altar, and begged for pardon at <lb/>
            Timoleon's hands if he revealed the whole plot. When <lb/>
            assured of his safety he confessed that he and the man <lb/>
            who had been killed had been sent thither to assassinate <lb/>
            Timoleon. Meanwhile others brought back the man from <lb/>
            the rock, who loudly declared that he had done no wrong, <lb/>
            but had justly slain him in vengeance for his father, <lb/>
            whom this wretch had killed at Leontini. Several of <lb/>
            those present bore witness to the truth of his story, and <lb/>
            they marvelled much at the ways of Fortune, how she <lb/>
            makes the most incongruous elements work together to <lb/>
            accomplish her purposes. The Corinthians honoured the <lb/>
            man with a present of ten minæ, because he had co-ope­ <lb/>
            rated with the guardian angel of Timoleon, and had put <lb/>
            off the satisfaction of his private wrong until a time when <lb/>
            it saved the life of the general. This good fortune excited <lb/>
            men's feelings so that they guarded and reverenced <lb/>
            Timoleon as a sacred person sent by heaven to restore the <lb/>
            liberties of Sicily.</p>
          <p>XVII. When Hiketes failed in this attempt on Timoleon, <lb/>
            and saw that many were joining him, he began to blame <lb/>
            himself for only using the great Carthaginian force that <lb/>
            was present by stealth, and as if he was ashamed of it, <lb/>
            concealing his alliance and using them clandestinely, and <lb/>
            he sent for Mago, their General, to come with all the force <lb/>
            at his disposal. He sailed in with a formidable fleet of a <lb/>
            hundred and fifty ships, and took possession of the harbour, <lb/>
            disembarked sixty thousand troops, and encamped with <lb/>
            them in the city of Syracuse, so that all men thought that <lb/>
            the long-talked-of and expected subjugation of Sicily to the <lb/>
            barbarian was imminent. For the Carthaginians during <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            their endless wars in Sicily had never before taken Syra­ <lb/>
            cuse, but now, by the invitation of the traitor .Hiketes, the <lb/>
            city was turned into a barbarian camp. The Corinthians <lb/>
            in the citadel were in a position of great danger and diffi­ <lb/>
            culty, as they no longer had sufficient provisions, because <lb/>
            the harbours were blockaded, and they perpetually had to <lb/>
            divide their forces for skirmishes and battles at the walls, <lb/>
            and to repel every device and method of attack known in <lb/>
            sieges.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Timoleon, however, relieved them by sending <lb/>
            corn from Katana in small fishing-smacks and boats, <lb/>
            which, chiefly in stormy weather, stole in through the <lb/>
            triremes of the barbarians when they were scattered by <lb/>
            the roughness of the sea. Mago and Hiketes, perceiving <lb/>
            this, determined to take Katana, from which place the <lb/>
            besieged drew their supplies, and they sailed from Syra­ <lb/>
            cuse with the best of their troops. The Corinthian Neon, <lb/>
            the General in command of the besieged force, observing <lb/>
            from the citadel that those of the enemy who were left <lb/>
            behind kept careless guard, suddenly fell upon them, and, <lb/>
            slaying some and routing the rest he made himself master <lb/>
            of Achradina, which is the strongest and least assailable <lb/>
            part of the city of Syracuse, which, as it were, consists of <lb/>
            several towns.</p>
          <p>Being now in possession of abundance of provisions and <lb/>
            money, he did not leave the place, and go back to the <lb/>
            citadel on the promontory, but fortified the circuit of <lb/>
            Achradina and held it conjointly with the Acropolis, with <lb/>
            which he connected its fortifications. A horseman from <lb/>
            Syracuse brought the news of the capture of Achradina to <lb/>
            Mago and Hiketes when they were close to Katana. <lb/>
            Alarmed at the news they returned with all speed, <lb/>
            having neither taken the city they went to take, nor kept <lb/>
            the one which they had taken.</p>
          <p>XIX. It may be doubted whether these actions owe <lb/>
            more to fortune than to courage and conduct; but the <lb/>
            next event can only be ascribed to fortune. The Corin­ <lb/>
            thian troops at Thurii were in fear of the Carthaginian <lb/>
            triremes under Hanno which were watching them, and as <lb/>
            the sea had for many days been excessively rough, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of a gale, determined to march on foot through <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            the Bruttii. Partly by persuasion and partly by force <lb/>
            they made their way to Rhegium, while the sea was still <lb/>
            very stormy. The Carthaginian Admiral, who no longer <lb/>
            expected the Corinthians, and thought that he was waiting <lb/>
            there to no purpose, persuaded himself that he had invented <lb/>
            a masterpiece of deceit. He ordered his sailors to crown <lb/>
            themselves with garlands, decked out his triremes with <lb/>
            Greek shields and wreaths of palm, and set out for Syra <lb/>
            cuse. As he passed the citadel they cheered loudly, and <lb/>
            with uproarious merriment called out to the garrison that <lb/>
            they had come back after a complete victory over the <lb/>
            Corinthians, hoping by this means to dispirit the besieged. <lb/>
            But while he was playing these silly tricks the Corinthians <lb/>
            had reached Rhegium, and as no one disputed their pas­ <lb/>
            sage, and the cessation of the gale had made the straits <lb/>
            singularly smooth and calm, they embarked in the passage <lb/>
            boats and what fishing-smacks were to be found, and <lb/>
            crossed over into Sicily, so easily and in such calm <lb/>
            weather that they were able to make their horses swim <lb/>
            alongside of the vessels and tow them by their halters.</p>
          <p>XX. As soon as they had crossed, Timoleon met them, <lb/>
            and at once obtained possession of Messina, and, after <lb/>
            reviewing them, marched on Syracuse at once, confiding <lb/>
            more in his good fortune and his former successes than <lb/>
            in the number of his troops, which amounted to no more <lb/>
            than four thousand. When Mago heard of this march, <lb/>
            he was much disquieted, and his suspicions of his allies <lb/>
            were increased by the following circumstance. In the <lb/>
            marshes round the city, into which runs much fresh <lb/>
            water from springs and rivers which find their way into <lb/>
            the sea, there was a great quantity of eels, which <lb/>
            afforded plenty of sport for those who cared to fish for <lb/>
            them; and the mercenary soldiers on both sides used to <lb/>
            meet and fish whenever there was a cessation of hostili­ <lb/>
            ties. As they were all Greeks, and had no private <lb/>
            grounds for hatred, they would cheerfully risk their <lb/>
            lives in battle against each other, but during times of <lb/>
            truce they conversed freely. So then, while engaged in <lb/>
            fishing, they talked to one another, and admired the beauty <lb/>
            of the sea, and the fine situation of the city. Then one of <lb/>
            the Corinthian garrison said, " Can it be that you, Greeks <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            as you are, should be endeavouring to betray to the <lb/>
            barbarian so great and beautiful a city as this, and that <lb/>
            you should be trying to establish these base and cruel <lb/>
            Carthaginians nearer to our country ? Rather ought you <lb/>
            to wish that there were more Sicilies to act as bulwarks <lb/>
            of Greece. Do you suppose that these men have gathered <lb/>
            together their host from the pillars of Herakles and the <lb/>
            Atlantic coast, and risked their lives at sea, merely to <lb/>
            support the dynasty of Hiketes ? He, if he had the spirit <lb/>
            of a real prince, never would have turned out his brethren, <lb/>
            and invited the enemy into his native land, but would <lb/>
            have made terms with Timoleon and the Corinthians, <lb/>
            and been honoured accordingly." These words were <lb/>
            noised abroad in the camp by the mercenaries, and gave <lb/>
            Mago the pretext which he had long been waiting for, <lb/>
            to abandon their cause on the plea of suspecting their <lb/>
            fidelity. Wherefore, although Hiketes begged him to <lb/>
            remain, and pointed out how far superior he was to the <lb/>
            enemy, yet he, thinking that Timoleon's army surpassed <lb/>
            his in courage and good fortune as much as his did in <lb/>
            numbers, weighed anchor at once and sailed to Africa, <lb/>
            letting Sicily slip through his fingers, to his great dis­ <lb/>
            grace, for no assignable reason.</p>
          <p>XXI. On the next day appeared Timoleon with his <lb/>
            troops in battle array. As soon as they learned their <lb/>
            departure, and saw the harbour, they proceeded to mock <lb/>
            at the cowardice of Mago, and they sent a crier round <lb/>
            the city offering a reward to any one who would tell <lb/>
            them to what place the Carthaginian force had run away. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, Hiketes still showed a bold front, and did <lb/>
            not relax his hold on the city, and, as the part which <lb/>
            was in his possession was strong and hard of access, <lb/>
            Timoleon divided his army, and himself led the assault <lb/>
            on the most difficult side of the position, by the river <lb/>
            Anapus, ordering another body, under Isias the Corin­ <lb/>
            thian, to attack from Achradina. A third corps, consisting <lb/>
            of the newly arrived reinforcement under Deinarchus and <lb/>
            Demaretus were to attack Epipolæ. The assault took <lb/>
            place simultaneously on all sides. The speedy rout of <lb/>
            Hiketes and capture of the city may be justly ascribed <lb/>
            to the skill of the General; but the fact that not one of <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            the Corinthians was killed or wounded is due to Timo­ <lb/>
            leon's good fortune, which seemed to vie with his courage <lb/>
            and try to make those who read of his exploits wonder <lb/>
            at their good luck more than their merit.</p>
          <p>In a few days not only was all Sicily and Italy ringing <lb/>
            with his fame, but throughout Greece his great successes <lb/>
            were known, and the city of Corinth, which scarcely <lb/>
            thought that the expedition had reached Sicily, heard <lb/>
            at the same time that the troops were safe and victorious, <lb/>
            so prosperously did affairs turn out, and with such speed <lb/>
            did fortune publish the glory of his deeds.</p>
          <p>XXII. Timoleon, having thus gained possession of the <lb/>
            fortified citadel on the promontory, did not fall into the <lb/>
            same snare as Dion, and was not moved to spare the place <lb/>
            for the sake of its beautiful and costly architecture. <lb/>
            Dion's jealousy of the people led him to distrust them, <lb/>
            and proved his ruin ; but Timoleon took a very different <lb/>
            course. He made proclamation that any Syracusan who <lb/>
            chose might come with a crowbar and take part in the <lb/>
            destruction of the despot's castle. When they had -all <lb/>
            assembled, in order to mark that day and that proclama­ <lb/>
            tion as the real beginning of liberty, they not only <lb/>
            destroyed and subverted the castle, but also the houses <lb/>
            and tombs of the despots. Timoleon at once had the <lb/>
            place levelled, and built upon it courts of justice, delight­ <lb/>
            ing the citizens by substituting a republic for a tyranny.</p>
          <p>Having taken the city, he was now at a loss for <lb/>
            citizens, for some had been killed in the wars and revolu­ <lb/>
            tions, and some had gone into exile to avoid the despots, <lb/>
            so that the market-place of Syracuse was overrun with <lb/>
            h erbage so deep and thick that horses were pastured on <lb/>
            it, while the grooms lay on the grass near them. The <lb/>
            other cities, except a very few, had become the haunts of <lb/>
            deer and wild boars, and persons at leisure used to hunt <lb/>
            them with dogs in the suburbs and round the walls. <lb/>
            None of those who had taken refuge in the various forts <lb/>
            and castles would return to the city, as they all felt a <lb/>
            dread and hatred of public assemblies and politics, which <lb/>
            had produced the greater part of the tyrants under whom <lb/>
            they had suffered. In this difficulty it occurred to <lb/>
            Timoleon and the Syracusans to apply to the Corinthians, <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            and ask them to send out fresh colonists from Greece. <lb/>
            Otherwise, they said, the land must lie uncultivated, <lb/>
            and, above all, they were looking forward to a great war <lb/>
            with Africa, as they heard that on Mago’s return the <lb/>
            Carthaginians were so enraged at his failure, that, though <lb/>
            he committed suicide to avoid a worse fate, they had <lb/>
            crucified his dead body, and were collecting a great force, <lb/>
            meaning next summer to invade Sicily.</p>
          <p>XXIII. When these letters from Timoleon reached <lb/>
            them, together with ambassadors from the Syracusans, <lb/>
            who besought them to take upon them the care of this <lb/>
            their poor city, and once again become the founders of it, <lb/>
            the Corinthians were not tempted by greed to take unfair <lb/>
            advantages and seize the city for themselves, but first <lb/>
            sent heralds to all the games held in honour of the gods <lb/>
            throughout Greece, and to all places where people as­ <lb/>
            sembled, to proclaim that the Corinthians, having abolished <lb/>
            despotism at Syracuse and driven out the despot, invite <lb/>
            all Syracusans and other Sicilian Greeks who choose to <lb/>
            go and dwell in the city under free institutions, receiving <lb/>
            an equal and just share of the land. Next they sent mes­ <lb/>
            sengers to Asia Minor and the islands, wherever they heard <lb/>
            that most of the scattered bands of exiles had settled, <lb/>
            and invited them all to come to Corinth, as the Corin­ <lb/>
            thians would at their own expense furnish them with <lb/>
            vessels and commanders and a safe convoy to Syracuse.</p>
          <p>By these proclamations Corinth gained great and well­ <lb/>
            deserved renown, seeing that she had forced Syracuse <lb/>
            from its tyrants, saved it from the barbarians, and given <lb/>
            back the country to its own citizens. The exiles, however, <lb/>
            when assembled at Corinth found their numbers too small, <lb/>
            and begged to be allowed to receive among them others <lb/>
            from Corinth and the rest of Greece. When by this <lb/>
            means they had raised their numbers to not less than ten <lb/>
            thousand, they sailed to Syracuse. Many citizens from <lb/>
            Italy and Sicily had already joined Timoleon, who, when <lb/>
            he found their numbers (according to Athanis) amount to <lb/>
            sixty thousand, divided the country among them, and sold <lb/>
            the houses for a thousand talents, affording the original <lb/>
            citizens the option of purchasing their own houses. At <lb/>
            the same time, to relieve the financial distress of the State, <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            with a view to the approaching war, he even sold all the <lb/>
            statues. A vote of the assembly was taken about each <lb/>
            one, and he was condemned, like a criminal on his trial. <lb/>
            On this occasion they say that the Syracusans, though they <lb/>
            condemned all the rest, decided on keeping that of the <lb/>
            ancient prince Gelo, because they admired and respected <lb/>
            him for his victory over the Carthaginians at Himera.</p>
          <p>XXIV. The life of Syracuse being rekindled by this <lb/>
            influx of citizens from all quarters, Timoleon determined <lb/>
            to set free the other cities also, and to exterminate the <lb/>
            despots in Sicily. In the course of his campaigns against <lb/>
            them he compelled Hiketes to renounce his alliance with <lb/>
            the Carthaginians, to demolish his castle, and to live in <lb/>
            Leontini as a private citizen. Leptines, the despot of <lb/>
            Apollonia and of several smaller towns, fearing to be <lb/>
            taken by him, surrendered. Timoleon spared his life, <lb/>
            and sent him to Corinth, as he thought that it reflected <lb/>
            credit upon his native city, that the despots of Sicily <lb/>
            should be seen by all Greece living there as humble exiles. <lb/>
            As for the soldiers whom he had in his pay, he determined <lb/>
            not to keep them idle, but to support them by the plunder <lb/>
            of an enemy's country. So while he himself returned to <lb/>
            Syracuse, to superintend the reconstruction of the con­ <lb/>
            stitution, and to assist the lawgivers Kephalus and <lb/>
            Dionysius in framing the best form of polity, he sent <lb/>
            the troops under Deinarchus and Demaretus to subdue <lb/>
            the western portion of the island, which had fallen into <lb/>
            the hands of the Carthaginians. Here they induced <lb/>
            several cities to revolt from the barbarians, and not only <lb/>
            gained abundant pay and plunder for themselves from <lb/>
            their conquests, but were able to furnish funds for the <lb/>
            approaching war.</p>
          <p>XXV. During this time the Carthaginian forces sailed <lb/>
            to Lily bæum with seventy thousand men, two hundred <lb/>
            ships of war, and a thousand transports carrying engines <lb/>
            of war, four horse chariots, provisions, and other war <lb/>
            material, as they meant no longer to use half measures, <lb/>
            but at one swoop tc drive the Greeks out of Sicily. <lb/>
            Their force indeed was sufficient for the conquest of the <lb/>
            Sikeliot Greeks even if they had not been weakened by <lb/>
            their internal strife.</p><pb n="416"/>
            
          <p>Hearing that their own part of the island was being <lb/>
            ravaged, they at once in great anger marched to attack <lb/>
            the Corinthians, under the command of Hasdrubal and <lb/>
            Hamilcar. News of this quickly reached Syracuse, and <lb/>
            the great numbers of the enemy caused such panic <lb/>
            among the citizens, that, numerous as they were, Timo­ <lb/>
            leon could only induce three thousand to get under arms <lb/>
            and follow him. Besides these, there was the paid force, <lb/>
            four thousand in number; and of these again about a <lb/>
            thousand were overcome by their fears on the march, <lb/>
            and went back, declaring that Timoleon could not be in <lb/>
            his right senses, but must be insane to march with five <lb/>
            thousand foot and a thousand horse to attack seventy <lb/>
            thousand men, and to separate his force eight days' jour­ <lb/>
            ney from Syracuse, in a place where there was no hope of <lb/>
            shelter for the fugitives or of honourable burial for the <lb/>
            dead. Timoleon treated it as an advantage that these <lb/>
            men disclosed their cowardice before the day of battle. <lb/>
            He encouraged the rest, and led them with all haste to <lb/>
            the river Krimesus, where he heard that the Carthaginians <lb/>
            were concentrating.</p>
          <p>XXVI. As he was mounting a hill, beyond which he <lb/>
            expected to see the camp and army of the enemy, there <lb/>
            met him some mules loaded with parsley. It occurred to <lb/>
            the soldiers that this was a bad omen, for we generally <lb/>
            use parsley for wreathing tombs; indeed from this <lb/>
            practice arises the proverb, when a man is dangerously <lb/>
            ill, that he is ready for his parsley. Wishing to rid them <lb/>
            from this superstition and to stop their fears, Timoleon <lb/>
            halted them, and made a suitable speech, pointing out <lb/>
            that their crown of victory had come of its own accord <lb/>
            into their hands before the battle, for this is the herb <lb/>
            with which the Corinthians crown the victors at the <lb/>
            Isthmian games, accounting it sacred and peculiar to their <lb/>
            own country. For then parsley was used for the crown <lb/>
            at the Isthmian games, as it is even to this day at those <lb/>
            of Nemea, and the pine has only been lately introduced. <lb/>
            So Timoleon, having addressed his soldiers, as has been <lb/>
            said, first crowned himself with the parsley, and then his <lb/>
            officers and men did so likewise. But the prophets per­ <lb/>
            ceiving two eagles flying towards them, one of whom <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            carried a snake in its talons, while the other flew along <lb/>
            with loud and inspiriting cries, pointed them out to the <lb/>
            soldiers, who all began to pray and invoke the gods.</p>
          <p>XXVII. The time of year was the beginning of summer, <lb/>
            near the solstice at the end of the month Thargelion.* A <lb/>
            thick mist rose from the river, and all the plain was con­ <lb/>
            cealed in fog, so that nothing could be seen of the enemy, <lb/>
            but only a confused murmur from the movement of that <lb/>
            great host reached the hill. The Corinthians, when they <lb/>
            had reached the summit, paused and piled their arms. <lb/>
            Now the sun shone out, and the mist rose from the valley. <lb/>
            Gathering together, it hung in clouds about the hill-tops, <lb/>
            while below, the river Krimesus appeared, with the enemy <lb/>
            crossing it.</p>
          <p>First went the four-horse chariots in terrible pomp, all <lb/>
            drawn up in battle array, while next to them followed ten <lb/>
            thousand hoplites with white shields. These they con­ <lb/>
            jectured to be native Carthaginians by the splendour of <lb/>
            their equipments and their slow and orderly march. <lb/>
            Following these came the other nations, turbulently and <lb/>
            confusedly struggling across. Timoleon, seeing that the <lb/>
            river kept off the mass of the enemy, and allowed them to <lb/>
            fight with just so many as they chose, pointed out to his <lb/>
            soldiers how the enemy's array was broken by the stream, <lb/>
            some having crossed, and some being still crossing. He <lb/>
            ordered Demaretus to take the cavalry and charge the <lb/>
            Carthaginians, to prevent their having time to form in <lb/>
            order of battle. But he himself marched down to the <lb/>
            plain, having drawn up his force with the other Sicilian <lb/>
            Greeks and a few strangers on each of the wings, but <lb/>
            with his Syracusans and the best of the paid force under <lb/>
            his own command in the centre.</p>
          <p>For a short time he held back, watching the effect of the <lb/>
            cavalry charge ; but seeing that they were unable to come <lb/>
            to blows with the Carthaginians because of the chariots <lb/>
            which careered about in front of their ranks, and that <lb/>
            they constantly had to fall back to avoid their array being <lb/>
            broken, and then to make short rushes as occasion served, <lb/>
            he himself took his shield, and called to the infantry to <lb/>
            follow him and be of good cheer. It seemed to them that <note type="footnote"> * About May. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="418"/>
            his voice was more than man's, and louder than was his <lb/>
            wont, either from their faculties being strained by the <lb/>
            excitement of the contest, or else because, as most of them <lb/>
            believed, some god shouted with him. Quickly they raised <lb/>
            their war-cry in answer, and begged him to lead them on <lb/>
            and wait no longer. Ordering the cavalry to ride round <lb/>
            the line of chariots and attack the infantry in flank, he <lb/>
            closed up the foremost ranks, and with the trumpet <lb/>
            sounding the charge, attacked the Carthaginians.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. They manfully encountered his first assault, <lb/>
            and being armed with iron cuirasses and brass helmets, <lb/>
            and protected with large shields, they were able to with­ <lb/>
            stand the thrust of the Greek spears. But when the <lb/>
            struggle came to be decided with swords, where skill as <lb/>
            well as strength was employed, there suddenly broke upon <lb/>
            them from the mountains a terrible storm of thunder <lb/>
            with vivid flashes of lightning . The mist, which had <lb/>
            hitherto hung about the mountain peaks, now rolled down <lb/>
            on to the field of battle, with violent gusts, hail, and rain. <lb/>
            The Greeks received it on their backs, while the rain beat <lb/>
            into the faces of the barbarians, and the lightning <lb/>
            dazzled their eyes, as the storm swept violently along <lb/>
            with frequent flashes from the clouds. These were great <lb/>
            disadvantages, especially to inexperienced men, as the <lb/>
            thunder and the pattering of the rain and hail on their <lb/>
            armour prevented their hearing the commands of their <lb/>
            officers. The Carthaginians, not being lightly equipped, <lb/>
            but, as has been narrated, in complete armour, slipped on <lb/>
            the muddy ground and were encumbered by the wet folds <lb/>
            of their dress, which rendered them less active in the fight, <lb/>
            and easily overcome by the Greeks, since when they fell <lb/>
            in the slippery mud they could not rise again with their <lb/>
            shields. The river Krimesus, which had been held up by <lb/>
            the multitudes that were crossing it, was now swollen to a <lb/>
            torrent by the rain, and the plain through which it runs, <lb/>
            lying as it does under many steep glens and ravines, was <lb/>
            now covered with streams not running in the ordinary <lb/>
            channels, in which the Carthaginians stumbled and were <lb/>
            hard bested.</p>
          <p>At last, from the violence of the storm, and the Greeks <lb/>
            having cut to pieces their front rank, a chosen body of four <lb/>
             <pb n="419"/>
            hundred men, the great mass turned and fled. Many <lb/>
            were overtaken and slain on the plain, and many more <lb/>
            perished in the river, while the light-armed troops <lb/>
            prevented most of them from gaining the shelter of the <lb/>
            mountains. It was said that among the myriads of slain <lb/>
            there were three thousand citizens of Carthage — a great <lb/>
            loss and grief to that city, for they belonged to the noblest <lb/>
            and richest classes; nor do we ever hear of so many <lb/>
            native Carthaginians having perished in any one battle <lb/>
            before this, as they generally make use of Libyan, Spanish <lb/>
            and Numidian troops, so that in case of defeat the loss <lb/>
            falls upon other nations.</p>
          <p>XXIX. The Greeks discovered the rank of the dead by <lb/>
            the richness of their spoil; for when they collected the booty <lb/>
            no account was taken of iron or brass, such an abundance <lb/>
            was there of silver and gold; for they crossed the river <lb/>
            and captured the enemy's camp. Of the captives, the <lb/>
            greater part were stolen by the soldiers, and sold privately, <lb/>
            but a body of five thousand was brought into the common <lb/>
            stock. Two hundred chariots also were taken. The most <lb/>
            glorious and magnificent spectacle of all was the tent of <lb/>
            Timoleon, round which booty of every kind was piled up <lb/>
            in heaps, among which were a thousand corslets of exqui­ <lb/>
            site workmanship, and ten thousand shields. As they <lb/>
            were but few to gather the plunder of so many, and as <lb/>
            they fell in with such riches, it was only on the third day <lb/>
            that they managed to erect a trophy of their victory. <lb/>
            Together with the despatch announcing his success, <lb/>
            Timoleon sent home to Corinth the finest of the arms and <lb/>
            armour, desiring to make his country envied by all men, <lb/>
            when they should see, in that alone of all Greek cities, that <lb/>
            the most important shrines were not adorned with Grecian <lb/>
            spoils, nor with offerings obtained by the slaughter of men <lb/>
            of their own race and blood, dismal memorials at best, <lb/>
            but with spoils of the barbarian, whose inscriptions bore <lb/>
            noble testimony to the justice, as well as the courage of the <lb/>
            victors, telling how the Corinthians and their general, Timo­ <lb/>
            leon, having freed the Greeks who dwell in Sicily from the <lb/>
            yoke of Carthage, set up these thank-offerings to the gods.</p>
          <p>XXX. After the victory he left the paid force in the <lb/>
            enemy's country, to ravage and plunder the Carthaginian <note type="footnote"> 2 E 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="420"/>
            dominions, and himself proceeded to Syracuse. He now <lb/>
            ordered out of the island those mercenary troops by whom <lb/>
            he had been deserted before the battle; and even forced them <lb/>
            to quit Sicily before sunset. These men crossed into Italy <lb/>
            and perished there at the hands of the Bruttians, who <lb/>
            broke their word to them and betrayed them. This was the <lb/>
            penalty which Heaven imposed on them for their desertion. <lb/>
            But Mamercus, the despot of Catana, and Hiketes, either <lb/>
            through disgust at Timoleon's successes, or else fearing <lb/>
            him as a man not likely to keep faith with despots, made <lb/>
            an alliance with Carthage, as they said that the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians, unless they wished to be utterly driven out of <lb/>
            Sicily, must send a competent force and a general. Gisco <lb/>
            the son of Hanno sailed thither with seventy ships, and <lb/>
            also with a force of Greek mercenary soldiers, whom the <lb/>
            Carthaginians had never used before; but now they were <lb/>
            full of admiration for the Greeks, as being the most <lb/>
            warlike and invincible of men. Having effected a junction <lb/>
            of their forces in the territory of Messina, they cut to <lb/>
            pieces a body of four hundred foreign soldiers whom <lb/>
            Timoleon sent against them ; amd in the Carthaginian <lb/>
            dominion they laid an ambush near the place called <lb/>
            Hietæ, and cut off the hired troops of Euthymus the <lb/>
            Leukadian. Both these circumstances made the good <lb/>
            fortune of Timoleon more renowned. For these were some <lb/>
            of the men who under Philomelus of Phokis and Ono­ <lb/>
            marchus sacrilegiously took Delphi, and shared in the <lb/>
            plunder of the temple. As all men loathed them and <lb/>
            shrank from them as from men under a curse, they <lb/>
            wandered about Peloponnesus until Timoleon, being <lb/>
            unable to get any other soldiers, enlisted them in his <lb/>
            service . When they reached Sicily, they were victorious <lb/>
            in every battle which they fought where he was present. <lb/>
            After the most important struggles of the war were over, <lb/>
            they were sent to reinforce others, and so perished and <lb/>
            came to nought; and not all at once, but piecemeal, as if <lb/>
            their avenging fate had given way to Timoleon's good <lb/>
            fortune for a season, lest the good should suffer from the <lb/>
            punishment of the wicked. Thus the kindness of the gods <lb/>
            towards Timoleon was no less seen and wondered at in <lb/>
            his failures than in his successes.</p><pb n="421"/>
            
          <p>XXXI. The people of Syracuse were much nettled by <lb/>
            the insulting jests passed upon them by the despots. <lb/>
            Mamercus, who plumed himself on his poems and trage­ <lb/>
            dies, gave himself great airs after conquering the mercen­ <lb/>
            aries, and when he hung up their shields as offerings to the <lb/>
            gods, he inscribed this insolent elegiac couplet upon them. <lb/>
            “ These, with purple wrought, and ivory, gold, and amber, <lb/>
            We with our simple shields conquered and laid in the dust." <lb/>
            After these events, while Timoleon was on a campaign in <lb/>
            the direction of Kalauria, Hiketes invaded the Syracusan <lb/>
            territory, did much damage and insult, and retired loaded <lb/>
            with spoil, past the very walls of Kalauria, despising <lb/>
            Timoleon, who had but a small force with him. He, <lb/>
            however, let him pass, but then pursued with his cavalry <lb/>
            and light troops. Hiketes, perceiving this, halted after <lb/>
            crossing the river Damyrias, and drew up his troops along <lb/>
            the farther bank to dispute the passage, encouraged to do <lb/>
            so by the different nature of the ford, and the steepness of <lb/>
            the hills on either hand. Now a strange rivalry and <lb/>
            contest arose among Timoleon's captains, which delayed <lb/>
            their onset. No one chose to let any one else lead the way <lb/>
            against the enemy, but each man wished to be first; so <lb/>
            that their crossing was conducted in a disorderly fashion, <lb/>
            each man trying to push by and outstrip the rest. Here­ <lb/>
            upon Timoleon, wishing to choose the leaders by lot, took <lb/>
            a ring from each. These he threw into his own cloak, mixed <lb/>
            them up, and showed the first which he drew out, which <lb/>
            happened to be engraved with the figure of a trophy of <lb/>
            victory. When the young men saw this they raised a <lb/>
            shout of joy, and would not wait for the rest to be drawn, <lb/>
            but each man, as fast as he could, rode through the river <lb/>
            and set upon the enemy. Their assault was irresistible ; <lb/>
            the enemy fled, all of them throwing away their shields, <lb/>
            and with the loss of a hundred men.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Soon after this, while Timoleon was campaign­ <lb/>
            ing in the Leontine country, he took Hiketes alive, with <lb/>
            his son Eupolemus, and Euthymus, the commander of his <lb/>
            cavalry. The soldiers seized and bound them, and led <lb/>
            them into Timoleon's presence. Hiketes and his son were <lb/>
            put to death as despots and traitors; nor did Euthymus <lb/>
             <pb n="422"/>
            meet with compassion, though he was a man of renown in <lb/>
            athletic contest, and of great personal bravery, because <lb/>
            of a scoffing speech of which he was accused against the <lb/>
            Corinthians. The story goes that he was addressing the <lb/>
            people of Leontini on the subject of the Corinthian in­ <lb/>
            vasion, and told them that there was nothing to be <lb/>
            alarmed at if <lb/>
            “ Corinthian ladies have come out from home. * <lb/>
            Thus it is that most people seem to suffer more from hard <lb/>
            words than hard deeds, and are more excited by insult <lb/>
            than by actual hurt. What we do to our enemies in war <lb/>
            is done of necessity, but the evil we say of them seems to <lb/>
            spring from an excess of spite.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. On Timoleon's return the Syracusans brought <lb/>
            the family and daughters of Hiketes before the public <lb/>
            assembly for trial, and condemned them to death.. And <lb/>
            this, methinks, is the most heartless of Timoleon's actions, <lb/>
            that for want of a word from him these poor creatures <lb/>
            should have perished. He seems not to have interfered, <lb/>
            and to have let the people give full vent to their desire to <lb/>
            avenge Dion, who dethroned Dionysius. For Hiketes was <lb/>
            the man who threw Dion's wife Arete alive into the sea, <lb/>
            with her sister Aristomache and her little son, as is told in <lb/>
            the Life of Dion.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. After this he marched against Mamercus at <lb/>
            Catana. He beat him in a pitched battle near the river <lb/>
            Abolus, routing him with a loss of two thousand men, no <lb/>
            small part of whom belonged to the Phœnician contingent <lb/>
            under Gisco. Hereupon, at the request of the Carthaginians, <lb/>
            he made peace, stipulating that they should hold the <lb/>
            country beyond the river Lykus, and that those who <lb/>
            wished should be allowed to have it and go to reside at <lb/>
            Syracuse, with their families and property, and also that <lb/>
            they should give up their alliance with the despots. In <lb/>
            despair at this Mamercus sailed to Italy, to try to bring <lb/>
            the Lucanians against Timoleon and the Syracusans; but <lb/>
            he was deserted by his followers, who turned their ships <lb/>
            back, sailed to Syracuse, and surrendered Catana to <note type="footnote"> * A line in the Medea of Euripides . The point of the joke depends <lb/>
            on the punctuation, but cannot be kept in translation. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="423"/>
            Timoleon. Mamercus now was forced to take refuge in <lb/>
            Messina with Hippo, the despot there. But Timoleon <lb/>
            came and besieged it both by sea and land. Hippo <lb/>
            endeavoured to escape on a ship, and was taken. The <lb/>
            people of Messina, to whom he was delivered up, brought <lb/>
            every one, even the boys from school, into the theatre, to <lb/>
            witness that most salutary spectacle, a tyrant meeting <lb/>
            with his deserts. He was put to death with torture; but <lb/>
            Mamercus surrendered himself to Timoleon on condition <lb/>
            that he should have a fair trial before the people of <lb/>
            Syracuse, and that Timoleon should say nothing against <lb/>
            him. When he was brought to Syracuse he was brought <lb/>
            before the people, and tried to deliver a long premeditated <lb/>
            speech to them, but meeting with interruptions and seeing <lb/>
            that the assembly was inexorable he flung away his cloak <lb/>
            and rushed across the theatre, striking his head against <lb/>
            a stone step with the intention of killing himself. How­ <lb/>
            ever he failed, and paid the penalty of his crimes by suffer­ <lb/>
            ing the death of a pirate.</p>
          <p>XXXV. In this fashion the despotisms were put down <lb/>
            by Timoleon, and the wars finished. The whole island, <lb/>
            which had become a mere wilderness through the constant <lb/>
            wars, and was grown hateful to the very natives, under <lb/>
            his administration became so civilized and desirable a <lb/>
            country that colonists sailed to it from those very places <lb/>
            to which its own citizens had formerly betaken themselves <lb/>
            to escape from it. For Akragas and Gela, large cities, <lb/>
            which after the war with Athens had been destroyed by <lb/>
            the Carthaginians, wore now repeopled; the former colonists <lb/>
            led by Megllus and Pheristus, from Elea on the south <lb/>
            coast of Italy, and the latter by a party led by Gorgus, <lb/>
            who sailed from Keos and collected together the former <lb/>
            citizens.</p>
          <p>When these cities were being reorganised Timoleon not <lb/>
            only afforded them peace and safety, but also gave them <lb/>
            great assistance, and showed so great an interest in them <lb/>
            as to be loved and respected by them as their real Founder. <lb/>
            The other cities also all of them looked upon him with the <lb/>
            same feelings, so that no peace could be made by them, <lb/>
            no laws established, no country divided among settlers, <lb/>
            no constitutional changes made that seemed satisfactory, <lb/>
             <pb n="424"/>
            unless he had a hand in them, and arranged them just as <lb/>
            an architect, when a building is finished, gives some <lb/>
            graceful touches which adorn the whole.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. There were many Greeks, in his lifetime, who <lb/>
            became great, and did great things, such as Timotheus, <lb/>
            and Agesilaus, and Pelopidas, and Timoleon's great model, <lb/>
            Epameinondas. But these men's actions produced a glory <lb/>
            which was involved in much strain and toil, and some of <lb/>
            their deeds have incurred censure, and even been repented <lb/>
            of. Whereas those of Timoleon, if we except the terrible <lb/>
            affair of his brother, have nothing in them to which we <lb/>
            cannot apply, like Timaeus, that verse of Sophocles­ <lb/>
            “ Ye gods, what Venus or what grace divine <lb/>
            Took part in this.” <lb/>
            For as in the poetry of Antimachus, and the paintings of <lb/>
            Dionysius, the Kolophonians, we find a certain vigour and <lb/>
            power, yet think them forced in expression, and produced <lb/>
            with much labour, while the paintings of Nikomachus and <lb/>
            the verses of Homer, besides their other graces and merits, <lb/>
            have the charm of seeming to have been composed easily <lb/>
            and without effort, so also the campaigns of Timoleon, <lb/>
            when compared with the laborious and hardly contested <lb/>
            ones of Epameinondas or Agesilaus, seem to have, besides <lb/>
            their glory, a wonderful ease, which property is not so <lb/>
            much to be attributed to good luck as to prosperous valour. <lb/>
            He, however, ascribed all his successes to Fortune, for in <lb/>
            writing to his friends at home, and in his public speeches <lb/>
            to the Syracusans, he frequently expressed his thankful­ <lb/>
            ness to this goddess, who, having determined to save <lb/>
            Sicily, had chosen to ascribe to him the credit of doing it. <lb/>
            In his house he built a chapel to Automatia,—the goddess <lb/>
            under whose auspices blessings and glory came as it were <lb/>
            of themselves. To her he offered sacrifices, and conse­ <lb/>
            crated his house to her. He lived in a house which the <lb/>
            Syracusans had bestowed upon him as a special prize for <lb/>
            his successes as general, and also the most beautiful and <lb/>
            pleasant country seat, where indeed he spent most of his <lb/>
            leisure time with his wife and children, whom he had sent <lb/>
            for from Corinth. For he never returned to Corinth, nor <lb/>
            mixed himself up in the troubles of Greece, nor did he <lb/>
             <pb n="425"/>
            expose himself to the hatred of political faction, which is <lb/>
            the rock upon which great generals commonly split, in <lb/>
            their insatiate thirst for honour and power; but he re­ <lb/>
            mained in Sicily, enjoying the blessings of which he was <lb/>
            the author; the greatest of which was to see so many <lb/>
            cities, and so many tens of thousands, all made happy and <lb/>
            prosperous by his means.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. But since, as Simonides says, all larks must <lb/>
            have crests, and all republics sycophants, so two of the <lb/>
            popular leaders, Laphystius and Demaenetus, attacked <lb/>
            Timoleon. When Laphystius was insisting on his giving <lb/>
            bail for some lawsuit, he would not permit the people to <lb/>
            hoot at him or stop him ; for he said that all his labours <lb/>
            and dangers had been endured to obtain for every Syra­ <lb/>
            cusan the right of appealing to the laws. Demaenetus <lb/>
            made many attacks in the public assembly on his general­ <lb/>
            ship ; but he made him no answer except to declare his <lb/>
            thankfulness to the gods for having granted his prayer <lb/>
            that he might see all Syracusans in possession of liberty <lb/>
            of speech.</p>
          <p>Though he confessedly had performed the greatest and <lb/>
            most glorious actions of any Greek of his time, and though <lb/>
            he had gained the glory of having alone done that which <lb/>
            the orators in their speeches at great public meetings used <lb/>
            to urge the entire nation to attempt, he was fortunately <lb/>
            removed from the troubles which fell upon ancient Greece, <lb/>
            and saved from defiling his hands with the blood of his <lb/>
            countrymen. His courage and conduct were shown at <lb/>
            the expense of barbarians and despots; his mildness of <lb/>
            temper was experienced by Greeks; he was able to erect <lb/>
            the trophies for most of his victories, without causing <lb/>
            tears and mourning to the citizens; but nevertheless, <lb/>
            within eight years, he restored Sicily to its native inha­ <lb/>
            bitants, freed from the scourges which had afflicted it for <lb/>
            so long a time and seemed so ineradicable. When ad­ <lb/>
            vanced in years he suffered from a dimness of sight, which <lb/>
            soon became total blindness. He had done nothing to <lb/>
            cause it, and had met with no accident, but the disease <lb/>
            was congenital, and in time produced a cataract. Many of <lb/>
            his relatives are said in a similar fashion to have lost <lb/>
            their sight when advanced in years. But Albania tells <lb/>
             <pb n="426"/>
            us that during the war with Hippo and Mamercus, at the <lb/>
            camp at Mylae, his eyesight became affected, and that this <lb/>
            was noticed by all, but that he did not on that account <lb/>
            desist from the siege, but persevered in the war, till he <lb/>
            captured the two despots; but as soon as he returned to <lb/>
            Syracuse he resigned his post of commander-in-chief, <lb/>
            begging the citizens to allow him to do so, as the war had <lb/>
            been brought to a happy conclusion.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. That he endured his misfortune without re­ <lb/>
            pining is not to be wondered at; but one must admire the <lb/>
            respect and love shown him when blind by the people <lb/>
            of Syracuse. They constantly visited him, and brought <lb/>
            with them any strangers that might be staying with them, <lb/>
            both to his town and country house, to show them their <lb/>
            benefactor, glorying in the fact that he had chosen to <lb/>
            spend his life amongst them, and had scorned the magni­ <lb/>
            ficent reception which his exploits would have ensured <lb/>
            him, had he returned to Greece. Of the many important <lb/>
            tributes to his worth none was greater than the decree <lb/>
            of the Syracusans that whenever they should be engaged <lb/>
            in war with foreign tribes, they would have a Corinthian <lb/>
            for their general. Great honour was also reflected upon <lb/>
            him by their conduct in the public assembly; for, though <lb/>
            they managed ordinary business by themselves, on the <lb/>
            occasion of any important debate they used to call him <lb/>
            in. Then he would drive through the market-place into <lb/>
            the theatre; and when the carriage in which he sat was <lb/>
            brought in, the people would rise and salute him with <lb/>
            one voice. Having returned their greeting, and allowed <lb/>
            a short time for their cheers and blessings, he would hear <lb/>
            the disputed point debated, and then give his opinion. <lb/>
            When this had been voted upon his servants would lead <lb/>
            his carriage out of the theatre, while the citizens, cheer­ <lb/>
            ing and applauding him as he went, proceeded to despatch <lb/>
            their other business without him.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Cherished in his old age with such respect <lb/>
            and honour, as the common father of his country, Timoleon <lb/>
            at length, after a slight illness, died. Some time was <lb/>
            given for the Syracusans to prepare his funeral, and for <lb/>
            neighbours and foreigners to assemble, so that the cere­ <lb/>
            mony was performed with great splendour. The bier, <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>
            magnificently adorned, and carried by young men chosen <lb/>
            by lot, passed over the place where once the castle of <lb/>
            Dionysius had been pulled down. The procession was <lb/>
            joined by tens of thousands of men and women, whose <lb/>
            appearance was gay enough for a festival, for they all <lb/>
            wore garlands and white robes. Their lamentations and <lb/>
            tears mingled with their praises of the deceased showed <lb/>
            that they were not performing this as a matter of mere <lb/>
            outward respect and compliance with a decree, but that <lb/>
            they expressed real sorrow and loving gratitude. At last, <lb/>
            when the bier was placed upon the pyre, Demetrius, the <lb/>
            loudest voiced of the heralds at that time, read aloud the <lb/>
            following :­</p>
          <p>" The Syracusan people solemnise, at the cost of two <lb/>
            hundred minæ, the funeral of this man, the Corinthian <lb/>
            Timoleon, son of Timodemus. They have passed a vote <lb/>
            to honour him for all future time with festival matches <lb/>
            in music, horse and chariot races, and gymnastics, because, <lb/>
            after having put down the despots, subdued the foreign <lb/>
            enemy, and recolonized the greatest among the ruined <lb/>
            cities, he restored to the Sicilian Greeks their constitution <lb/>
            and laws." *</p>
          <p>They buried him in the market-place, and afterwards <lb/>
            surrounded the spot with a colonnade, and built a palastra <lb/>
            in it for the young men to practise in, and called it the <lb/>
            Timoleonteum; and, living under the constitution and <lb/>
            laws which he established, they passed many years in <lb/>
            prosperity. <note type="footnote"> * <unclear>Groda</unclear> </note></p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF ÆMILIUS .</title>
          </head>
          <p>II.* MOST writers agree that the JEmilian was one of the <lb/>
            most noble and ancient of the patrician families of Rome. <lb/>
            Those who tell us that King Numa was a pupil of Pytha­ <lb/>
            goras, narrate also that Mamercus, the founder of this <lb/>
            family, was a son of that philosopher, who for his <lb/>
            singular grace and subtlety of speech was surnamed <lb/>
            AEmilius. Most of the members of the family who gained <lb/>
            distinction by their valour, were also fortunate, and <lb/>
            even the mishap of Lucius Paullus at Cannæ bore ample <lb/>
            testimony to his prudence and valour. For since he <lb/>
            could not prevail upon his colleague to refrain from <lb/>
            battle, he, though against his better judgment, took part <lb/>
            in it, and disdained to fly; but when he who had begun <lb/>
            the contest fled from it, he stood firm, and died fighting <lb/>
            the enemy. This Æmilius had a daughter, who married <lb/>
            Scipio the Great, and a son who is the subject of this <lb/>
            memoir. Born in an age which was rendered illustrious <lb/>
            by the valour and wisdom of many distinguished men, <lb/>
            he eclipsed them all, though he followed none of the <lb/>
            studies by which young men were then gaining them­ <lb/>
            selves a reputation, but chose a different path. He did <lb/>
            not practise at the bar, nor could he bring himself to <lb/>
            court the favour of the people by the greetings, embraces, <lb/>
            and professions of friendship to which most men used to <lb/>
            stoop to obtain popularity. Not that he was by nature <lb/>
            unfitted for such pursuits; but he considered it better <lb/>
            to gain a reputation for courage, justice, and truth, in <lb/>
            which he soon outshone his contemporaries.</p>
          <p>III. The first honourable office for which he was a <lb/>
            candidate was that of aedile, for which he was elected <lb/>
            against twelve others, who, they say, all afterwards <note type="footnote"> * In Sintenis's text the chapter with which this life usually begins <lb/>
            is prefixed to the Life of Timoleon . </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            became consuls. When chosen a priest of the college <lb/>
            of Augurs, whom the Romans appoint to watch and <lb/>
            register the omens derived from the flight of birds, or <lb/>
            the signs of the heavens, he so carefully applied himself <lb/>
            to learning the ancient customs and religion of his <lb/>
            ancestors, that the priesthood, hitherto merely considered <lb/>
            as an empty title of honour and sought after for that <lb/>
            reason only, became regarded as the sublimest craft of <lb/>
            all, confirming the saying of the philosophers, that <lb/>
            holiness consists in a knowledge of how to serve the <lb/>
            gods. Under him everything was done with both zeal <lb/>
            and skill. He neglected all other duties, when engaged <lb/>
            upon these, neither omitting any part nor adding any, <lb/>
            arguing with his companions, when they blamed him for <lb/>
            his care about trifles, that though a man might think <lb/>
            that heaven was merciful and forgiving of negligences, <lb/>
            yet that habitual disregard and overlooking of such <lb/>
            points was dangerous for the state, seeing that no one <lb/>
            ever begins till some flagrant breach of the law to disturb <lb/>
            the constitution, but those who are careless of accuracy <lb/>
            in small things soon begin to neglect the most important. <lb/>
            He was no less severe in exacting and maintaining military <lb/>
            discipline than with religious observances, never forget­ <lb/>
            ting the general in the demagogue, nor, as many then <lb/>
            did, endeavouring to make his first command lead to a <lb/>
            second by indulgence and affability to his troops, but, <lb/>
            like a priest expounding mysteries, he carefully taught <lb/>
            them everything requisite for a campaign, and, by his <lb/>
            severity to the careless and disobedient, restored the <lb/>
            former glory to his country; for he seemed to think <lb/>
            victory over the enemy was merely a subordinate inci­ <lb/>
            dent in the great work of disciplining his fellow-citizens.</p>
          <p>IV. When the Romans were at war with Antiochus <lb/>
            the Great, and all their most experienced generals were <lb/>
            employed against him, there arose another war in the <lb/>
            west of Europe, in consequence of revolutionary move­ <lb/>
            ments in Spain. Æmilius was appointed commander to <lb/>
            conduct this war, not with six lictors only, like ordinary <lb/>
            generals, but twelve, so as to give him consular authority. <lb/>
            He defeated the barbarians in two pitched battles, with <lb/>
            a loss of nearly thirty thousand. The credit of this <lb/>
             <pb n="430"/>
            exploit belongs peculiarly to the general, who made such <lb/>
            use of the advantage of the ground, and the ford over <lb/>
            a certain river, as to render victory an easy matter <lb/>
            for his soldiers. He also took two hundred and fifty <lb/>
            cities, which opened their gates to him. Having estab­ <lb/>
            lished a lasting peace in his province he returned to <lb/>
            Rome, not having gained a penny by his command. For <lb/>
            he was careless of money-making, though he spent his <lb/>
            fortune without stint; and it was so small, that after his <lb/>
            death it hardly sufficed to make up the dower of his wife.</p>
          <p>V. He married Papiria, the daughter of Papirius Maso, <lb/>
            a consular; and after living with her for a considerable <lb/>
            time, divorced her, though he had by her an illustrious <lb/>
            family, for she was the mother of the renowned Scipio, <lb/>
            and of Fabius Maximus. No reason for their separation <lb/>
            has come down to us, but there is much truth in that <lb/>
            other story about a divorce, that some Roman put away <lb/>
            his wife; and his friends then blamed him, saying, “ Is <lb/>
            she not chaste? is she not beautiful? is she not fruitful?" <lb/>
            He, stretching out his shoe, said, " Is it not beautiful? is <lb/>
            it not new ? But none of you can tell where it pinches me. <lb/>
            In fact, some men divorce their wives for great and mani­ <lb/>
            fest faults, yet the little but constant irritation which <lb/>
            proceeds from incompatible tempers and habits, though <lb/>
            unnoticed by the world at large, does gradually produce <lb/>
            between married people breaches which cannot be healed."</p>
          <p>So Æmilius put away Papiria, and married again. By <lb/>
            his second marriage he had two sons, whom he kept at <lb/>
            home, but those by the former marriage he had adopted <lb/>
            into the greatest and noblest families of Rome, the elder <lb/>
            into that of Fabius Maximus, who had five times been <lb/>
            consul, while the younger was treated by Scipio Africans <lb/>
            as his cousin, and took the name of Scipio.</p>
          <p>Of his two daughters, one married a son of Cato, the <lb/>
            other Ælius Tubero, an excellent man, who supported <lb/>
            his poverty more gloriously than any other Roman. <lb/>
            There were sixteen in the family, all Ælii; and one <lb/>
            small house and estate sufficed for them all, with their <lb/>
            numerous offspring and their wives, among whom was <lb/>
            the daughter of our Æmilius, who, though her father had <lb/>
            twice been consul and twice triumphed, was not ashamed <lb/>
             <pb n="431"/>
            of the poverty of her husband, but was proud of the <lb/>
            virtue that kept him poor. But nowadays brothers and <lb/>
            kinsmen, unless their inheritances be divided by moun­ <lb/>
            tain ranges, rivers, and walls like fortifications, with <lb/>
            plenty of space between them, quarrel without ceasing. <lb/>
            These are the materials for reflection which history <lb/>
            affords to those who choose to make use of them.</p>
          <p>VI. Æmilius, when elected consul, marched against <lb/>
            the sub-Alpine Ligurians, called by some Ligustines, a <lb/>
            brave and spirited nation, and from their nearness to <lb/>
            Rome, skilled in the arts of war. Mixed with the Gauls, <lb/>
            and the Iberians of the sea coast, they inhabit the ex­ <lb/>
            tremity of Italy where it dies away into the Alps, and <lb/>
            also that part of the Alps which is washed by the Tuscan <lb/>
            Sea, opposite the Libyan coast. At this time they took <lb/>
            also to seafaring, and, sailing forth in small piratical ships, <lb/>
            they plundered and preyed upon commerce as far as the <lb/>
            columns of Heracles. On Æmilius’s approach they op­ <lb/>
            posed him, forty thousand strong; but he, with only <lb/>
            eight thousand, attacked five-fold his own numbers, put <lb/>
            them to rout, and having chased them into their fast­ <lb/>
            nesses, offered them reasonable and moderate terms; for <lb/>
            it was not the Roman policy utterly to exterminate the <lb/>
            Ligurian race, but to leave them as an outwork to <lb/>
            protect Italy against the constant movements of the <lb/>
            Gaulish tribes.</p>
          <p>Trusting in Æmilius they surrendered all their ships <lb/>
            and their cities into his hands. He did the cities no hurt, <lb/>
            or at most destroyed the walls, and restored them to the <lb/>
            owners, but he carried off all the ships, leaving them <lb/>
            nothing larger than a six-oared boat; while he set free the <lb/>
            numerous captives which they had taken both by sea and <lb/>
            land, among whom were some Roman citizens. These <lb/>
            were his glorious exploits in that consulship. Afterwards <lb/>
            he frequently let his desire for re-election be seen, and <lb/>
            once became a candidate, but as he failed and was passed <lb/>
            over, he thenceforth remained in retirement, occupying <lb/>
            himself with religious matters, and teaching his children <lb/>
            not only the Roman education in which he himself had <lb/>
            been brought up, but also the Greek, and that more <lb/>
            carefully. For not only were the grammarians, philoso­ <lb/>
             <pb n="432"/>
            pliers, and orators Greek, but also the sculptors and <lb/>
            painters, and the young men kept Greeks to manage <lb/>
            their horses and hounds, and instruct them in hunting. <lb/>
            .Emilius, unless hindered by public business, always was <lb/>
            present at the exercises and studies of his sons, and was <lb/>
            the kindest father in Rome.</p>
          <p>VII. This was the period during which the Romans, <lb/>
            who were at war with Perseus, King of Macedon, com­ <lb/>
            plained of their generals, whose ignorance and cowardice <lb/>
            had led to the most disgraceful and ridiculous failure, and <lb/>
            to the sustaining of much more loss than they inflicted. <lb/>
            They, who had just driven Antiochus, called the Great, <lb/>
            out of Asia Minor, beyond Taurus, and restricted him to <lb/>
            Syria, making him glad to purchase peace at the price of <lb/>
            fifteen thousand talents; who, a little before, had crushed <lb/>
            Philip in Thessaly, and set free the Greeks from the <lb/>
            power of Macedon; and who had also utterly subdued <lb/>
            Hannibal himself, a man whose daring and immense <lb/>
            resources rendered him far more dangerous an opponent <lb/>
            than any king, thought that it was not to be borne that <lb/>
            Perseus should wage war as if he were on equal terms <lb/>
            with the Roman people, and that, too, with only the <lb/>
            remnants of his father's routed forces; for they did not <lb/>
            know that Philip, after his defeat, had greatly increased <lb/>
            the power and efficiency of the Macedonian army. To <lb/>
            explain which, I shall briefly relate the story from the <lb/>
            beginning.</p>
          <p>VIII. Antigonus, who was the most powerful of the <lb/>
            generals and successors of Alexander, and who obtained for <lb/>
            himself and his family the title of king, had a ion named <lb/>
            Demetrius, whose son was Antigonus, called Gonatas. His <lb/>
            son again was named Demetrius, who, after reigning some <lb/>
            short time, died, leaving a son Philip, a mere boy in years. <lb/>
            Fearing disturbance during his minority, the Macedonian <lb/>
            nobles made Antigonus, a cousin of the deceased, Regent <lb/>
            and commander-in-chief, associating with him in this <lb/>
            office the mother of Philip. Finding him a moderate and <lb/>
            useful ruler, they soon gave him the title of king. He had <lb/>
            the soubriquet of Doson, as though he were only a pro­ <lb/>
            miser, not a performer of his engagements. After this <lb/>
            man, Philip came to the throne, and, while yet a boy, dis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="433"/>
            tinguished himself in all that becomes a king, so as to <lb/>
            raise men's hopes that he might restore the empire of <lb/>
            Macedon to its ancient glory, and be alone able to check <lb/>
            the power of Rome, which now menaced the whole world. <lb/>
            Defeated in a great battle at Scotussa by Titus Flamininus, <lb/>
            he bent to the storm, surrendered all that he had to the <lb/>
            Romans, and was thankful for mild treatment. After­ <lb/>
            wards, chafing at his subordinate position, and thinking <lb/>
            that to reign dependent on the pleasure of the Romans <lb/>
            was more worthy of a slave who cares only for sensual <lb/>
            pleasure, than of a man of spirit, he gave his whole mind <lb/>
            up to preparations for war, and secretly and unscrupulously <lb/>
            collected materials for it. Of the cities in his kingdom, <lb/>
            he allowed those on the sea-coast and the main roads to <lb/>
            fall into partial decay, so that his power might be despised, <lb/>
            while he collected great forces in the interior. Here he <lb/>
            filled all the outposts, fortresses, and cities with arms, <lb/>
            money, and men fit for service, and thus trained the <lb/>
            nation for war, yet kept his preparations secret. In his <lb/>
            arsenals were arms for thirty thousand men; eight million <lb/>
            medimni of corn were stored in his fortresses, and such a <lb/>
            mass of treasure as would pay an army of ten thousand <lb/>
            men for ten years. But before he could put all these <lb/>
            forces in motion and begin the great struggle, he died of <lb/>
            grief and remorse, for he had, as he admitted, unjustly <lb/>
            put his other son Demetrius to death on the calumnies of <lb/>
            one far worse than he was. Perseus, the survivor, in­ <lb/>
            herited his father's hatred of the Romans with his kingdom, <lb/>
            but was not of a calibre to carry out his designs, as his <lb/>
            small and degraded mind was chiefly possessed by avarice. <lb/>
            He is said not even to have been legitimate, but that <lb/>
            Philip's wife obtained him when a baby from his real <lb/>
            mother, a midwife of Argos, named Gnathaina, and palmed <lb/>
            him off upon her husband. And this seems to have been <lb/>
            one reason for her putting Demetrius to death, for fear <lb/>
            that if the family had a legitimate heir, this one's bastardy <lb/>
            would be discovered.</p>
          <p>IX. However, low-born and low-minded though he was, <lb/>
            yet having by the force of circumstances drifted into war, <lb/>
            he held his own and maintained himself for a long time <lb/>
            against the Romans, defeating generals of consular rank <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="434"/>
            with great armies, and even capturing some of them. <lb/>
            Publius Licinius, who first invaded Macedonia, was <lb/>
            defeated in a cavalry engagement, with a loss of two <lb/>
            thousand five hundred brave men killed, and six hundred <lb/>
            prisoners. Perseus next by a sudden attack made himself <lb/>
            master of the Roman naval station at Oreus, took twenty <lb/>
            store ships, sunk the rest, which were loaded with grain, <lb/>
            and took also four quinqueremes.* He fought also a <lb/>
            second battle, in which he drove back the consular general <lb/>
            Hostilius, who was trying to invade Macedonia near <lb/>
            Elimiæ ; and when he tried to steal in through Thessaly, <lb/>
            he again offered battle, which the Roman declined. As an <lb/>
            accessory to the war he now made a campaign against the <lb/>
            Dardans, as if affecting to despise the Romans and to be at <lb/>
            leisure. Here he cut to pieces ten thousand of the bar­ <lb/>
            barians, and carried off much plunder. He also had <lb/>
            secret negotiations with the Gauls who dwell near the <lb/>
            Ister, called Basternæ, a nation of warlike horsemen, and <lb/>
            by means of Genthius their king he endeavoured to induce <lb/>
            the Illyrians to take part in the war. There was even a <lb/>
            report that the barbarians had been induced by his bribes <lb/>
            to march through the southern part of Gaul beside the <lb/>
            Adriatic, and so invade Italy.</p>
          <p>X. The Romans, when they learnt all this, determined <lb/>
            that they would disregard political influence in their <lb/>
            choice of a general, and choose some man of sense and <lb/>
            capable of undertaking great operations. Such a one was <lb/>
            Paulus Æmilius, a man of advanced age, being about sixty <lb/>
            years old, but still in full vigour of body, and surrounded <lb/>
            by kinsmen, grown-up sons, and friends, who all urged <lb/>
            him to listen to the appeal of his country and be consul. <lb/>
            He at first treated the people with little respect, and <lb/>
            shunned their eager professions of zeal, on the plea that <lb/>
            he did not wish for the command; but as they waited on <lb/>
            him daily, and called for him to come into the forum and <lb/>
            shouted his name, he was at length prevailed upon. <lb/>
            When a candidate, he seemed to enter the field not with a <lb/>
            view to getting office, but to giving victory and strength <lb/>
            in battle to his fellow-citizens; with such zeal and conn­ <lb/>
            dence did they unanimously elect him consul for the <note type="footnote"> 0 Ships of war with five banks of oars. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="435"/>
            second time, not permitting lots to be cast for provinces <lb/>
            by the two consuls, as is usual, but at once decreeing to <lb/>
            him the management of the Macedonian war. It is said <lb/>
            that when he was named general against Perseus, he was <lb/>
            escorted home in triumph by the people en masse, and <lb/>
            found his daughter Tertia, who was quite a little child, <lb/>
            in tears. He embraced her, and asked her why she was <lb/>
            crying; and she, throwing her arms round him and <lb/>
            kissing him, said, " Do you not know,. father, that our Per­ <lb/>
            seus is dead ?" meaning a little dog which she had brought <lb/>
            up, which was so named. AEmilius said, " May this <lb/>
            bring good luck, my daughter : I accept the omen." This <lb/>
            story Cicero the orator tells in his book on Divination.</p>
          <p>XI. It being the custom that the consuls-elect should <lb/>
            return thanks, and make a gracious speech to the people <lb/>
            from the rostrum, Æmilius called together the people and <lb/>
            said that he had sought for his former consulship because <lb/>
            he wanted office, but for this one because they wanted a <lb/>
            general: wherefore he felt no gratitude towards them, <lb/>
            but would lay down his consulship if they thought that <lb/>
            they would succeed better in the war under some one else; <lb/>
            but if they felt confidence in him, he asked them not to <lb/>
            interfere with his acts as general, nor to gossip about him, <lb/>
            but to furnish quietly what was wanted for the war; for <lb/>
            if they tried to command their commander they would <lb/>
            afford even a more sorry spectacle than they had already <lb/>
            done. By these words he made the citizens stand greatly <lb/>
            in awe of him, and gave them great expectations of what <lb/>
            he would effect, while all rejoiced that they had passed <lb/>
            over those who used to flatter them, and had chosen a <lb/>
            general of independence and spirit. So much did the <lb/>
            Roman people respect bravery and honour, because it led <lb/>
            to conquests, and to making them masters of the world.</p>
          <p>XII. I consider it to have been by divine favour that <lb/>
            AEmilius Paulus on starting for his campaign met with <lb/>
            such a fortunate and calm voyage, and so speedily and <lb/>
            safely arrived at the camp; but as to the war itself, and <lb/>
            his conduct of it, accomplished as it was partly by swift <lb/>
            daring, partly by wise dispositions, by the valour of <lb/>
            friends, confidence in the midst of dangers, and reliance <lb/>
            on sound plans, I cannot tell of any glorious and distin- <note type="footnote"> 2 F 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="436"/>
            guished exploit, which, as in the case of other generals, <lb/>
            owed its success to his good fortune; unless, indeed, any <lb/>
            one should count as good fortune for Æmilius the avarice <lb/>
            of Perseus, which destroyed the great and well-founded <lb/>
            hopes of the Macedonians in the war, and brought them <lb/>
            to ruin by the meanness of their chief. At his request <lb/>
            there came a force of Basternæ, a thousand horse and ten <lb/>
            thousand light troops who fought with them, all mercenary <lb/>
            Koldiers—men who knew nothing of tilling the soil, or of <lb/>
            sailing the sea, who did not live from the produce of their <lb/>
            flocks, but who studied one art and business solely, ever <lb/>
            to fight and overcome their antagonists. So, when in the <lb/>
            camp at Mædike, these men mixed with the king's troops, <lb/>
            tall in their person, admirable in their drill, boastful and <lb/>
            haughty in their defiance of the foe, they gave confidence <lb/>
            to the Macedonians, and made them think that the <lb/>
            Romans never could withstand their attack, but would be <lb/>
            terrified at their appearance and march, outlandish and <lb/>
            ferocious as it was. But Perseus, now that he had got such <lb/>
            auxiliaries as these, and put his men into such heart, <lb/>
            because he was asked for a thousand staters for each <lb/>
            officer, became bewildered at the amount of the sum <lb/>
            which he would have to pay, and his meanness prevailing <lb/>
            over his reason, refused their offers, and broke off the <lb/>
            alliance, as if he had been steward of his kingdom for the <lb/>
            Romans rather than fighting against them, and had to <lb/>
            give an exact account of his expenses in the war to his <lb/>
            enemies; though he might have been taught by them, who <lb/>
            had besides other war materials, a hundred thousand <lb/>
            soldiers collected together ready for use. Yet he, when <lb/>
            engaged in war with such a power as this, where such <lb/>
            great forces were kept on foot to contend with him, kept 1 <lb/>
            doling out and sparing his money as if it were not his <lb/>
            own. And still he was not a Lydian or Phœnician, but <lb/>
            a man who from his descent ought to have had a share of <lb/>
            the spirit of Philip and Alexander, who made all their <lb/>
            conquests by the principle that empire may be gained by <lb/>
            gold, not gold by empire. It used, indeed, to be a <lb/>
            proverb that "It is not Philip, but Philip's gold that <lb/>
            takes the cities of Greece." Alexander, too, when begin­ <lb/>
            ning his Indian campaign, seeing the Macedonians labori. <lb/>
             <pb n="437"/>
            ously dragging along the rich and unwieldy plunder of <lb/>
            the Persians, first burned all the royal carriages, and then <lb/>
            persuaded the soldiers to do the like with their own, and <lb/>
            start for the war as light as if they had shaken off a <lb/>
            burden. But Perseus, when spending his own money to <lb/>
            defend himself, his children, and his kingdom, rather than <lb/>
            sacrifice a little and win, preferred to be taken to Rome <lb/>
            with many others, a rich captive, and show the Romans <lb/>
            how much he had saved for them.</p>
          <p>XIII. For not only did he dismiss the Gauls and break <lb/>
            his word to them, but after inducing Genthius the Illyrian <lb/>
            to take part in the war for a bribe of three hundred talents, <lb/>
            he lodged the money with that prince's envoys, all <lb/>
            counted, and let them put their seals upon it. Genthius <lb/>
            then thinking that he had got what he asked, did a <lb/>
            wicked and impious deed in seizing and throwing into <lb/>
            prison some Roman ambassadors who were sent to him. <lb/>
            Perseus, thinking that Genthius no longer needed money <lb/>
            to make him hostile to Rome, since he had given him <lb/>
            such a pledge of his hatred of it, and had involved himself <lb/>
            in war with it by such a crime, deprived the poor man of <lb/>
            his three hundred talents, and shortly afterwards looked <lb/>
            calmly on while he and his family were plucked out of <lb/>
            their kingdom, like birds out of a nest, by Lucius Anicius, <lb/>
            who was sent with an army against him. AEmilius, when <lb/>
            he came to contend with such a rival as this, despised him <lb/>
            as a man, but was surprised at the force which he had at <lb/>
            his disposal. These were four thousand cavalry, and of <lb/>
            infantry soldiers of the Macedonian phalanx nearly forty <lb/>
            thousand. Encamped by the sea-shore, near the skirts <lb/>
            of Mount Olympus, on ground nowhere accessible, and <lb/>
            strongly fortified by himself with outworks and defences <lb/>
            of wood, Perseus lived in careless security, thinking that <lb/>
            by time and expense he should wear out Æmilius’s attack. <lb/>
            But he, while he busied his mind with every possible <lb/>
            mode of assault, perceiving that his army in consequence <lb/>
            of its past want of discipline was impatient, and usurped <lb/>
            the general'a province by proposing all sorts of wild <lb/>
            schemes, severely reprimanded the soldiers, and ordered <lb/>
            them not to meddle with what was not their concern, but <lb/>
            only take care that they and their arms were ready, and <lb/>
             <pb n="438"/>
            to use their swords as Romans should when their general <lb/>
            should give the word. He ordered the night sentries to <lb/>
            go on guard without their spears, that they might be <lb/>
            more attentive and less inclined to sleep, having no arms <lb/>
            to defend themselves against the enemy.</p>
          <p>XIV. The army was chiefly troubled by want of water; <lb/>
            for only a very little bad water ran or rather dripped out <lb/>
            of a spring near the sea. Æmilius perceiving that <lb/>
            Olympus, immediately above him, was a large and well­ <lb/>
            wooded mountain, and guessing from the greenness of the <lb/>
            foliage that it must contain some springs which had their <lb/>
            courses underground, dug many pits and wells along the <lb/>
            skirts of the mountain, which immediately were filled <lb/>
            with pure water, which by the pressure above was driven <lb/>
            into these vacant spaces. Yet some say that there are no <lb/>
            hidden fountains of water, lying ready in such places as <lb/>
            these, and say that it is not because they are dug out or <lb/>
            broken into that they flow, but that they have their <lb/>
            origin and cause in the saturation of the surrounding <lb/>
            earth which becomes saturated by its close texture and <lb/>
            coldness, acting upon the moist vapours, which when pressed <lb/>
            together, low down turn into water. For just as women's <lb/>
            breasts are not receptacles full of milk ready to flow, but <lb/>
            change the nutriment which is in them into milk, and so <lb/>
            supply it, so also the cold places which are full of springs <lb/>
            have no water concealed in them, nor any such reservoirs <lb/>
            as would be needed to send out deep rivers from any fixed <lb/>
            point, but by their pressure they convert the air and <lb/>
            vapour which is in them into water. At any rate, those <lb/>
            places which are dug over break more into springs and <lb/>
            run more with water, in answer to this treatment of their <lb/>
            surface, just as women's breasts respond to sucking, for it <lb/>
            moistens and softens the vapour; whereas land which is <lb/>
            not worked is incapable of producing water, not having <lb/>
            the motion by which moisture is obtained. Those who <lb/>
            argue thus have given sceptics the opportunity of saying, <lb/>
            that if it be true, there can be no blood in animals, but <lb/>
            that it gathers about wounds, and that the flow of blood <lb/>
            is produced by the air, or some change which takes place <lb/>
            in the flesh. They are proved to be wrong by those who <lb/>
            sink shafts for mines, and meet with rivers in the depths <lb/>
             <pb n="439"/>
            of the earth, which have not collected themselves by <lb/>
            degrees, as would be the case if they derived their origin <lb/>
            from the sudden movements of the earth, but flow with a <lb/>
            full stream. Also, when mountains and rocks are fissured <lb/>
            by a blow, there springs out a gush of water, which after­ <lb/>
            wards ceases. But enough of this.</p>
          <p>XV. AEmilius remained quiet for some days, and it is <lb/>
            said two such great hosts never were so near together and <lb/>
            so quiet. After exploring and trying every place he <lb/>
            discovered that there was still one pass unguarded, that, <lb/>
            namely, through Perrhæbæ by Pythium and Petra. He <lb/>
            called a council of war to consider this, being himself more <lb/>
            hopeful of success that way, as the place was not watched, <lb/>
            than alarmed at the precipices on account of which the <lb/>
            enemy neglected it. First of those present, Scipio, sur­ <lb/>
            named Nasica, son-in-law to Scipio Africanus, afterwards <lb/>
            a leading man in the Senate, volunteered to lead the party <lb/>
            which was to make this circuitous attack. And next <lb/>
            Fabius Maximus, the eldest of the sons of Æmilius, though <lb/>
            still only a youth, rose and spiritedly offered his services. <lb/>
            AEmilius, delighted, placed under their command not so <lb/>
            many troops as Polybius says in his history, but so many as <lb/>
            Nasica himself tells us that he had, in a letter which he wrote <lb/>
            to one of the princes of that region about this affair. He <lb/>
            had three thousand Italians, besides his main body, and <lb/>
            five thousand who composed the left wing. Besides these, <lb/>
            Nasica took a hundred and twenty horse, and two hundred <lb/>
            of Harpalus's light troops, Thracians and Cretans mixed. <lb/>
            He began his march along the road towards the sea, and <lb/>
            encamped near the temple of Herakles, as though he <lb/>
            intended to sail round to the other side of the enemy's <lb/>
            camp, and so surround him: but when the soldiers had <lb/>
            supped, and it was dark, he explained his real plan to his <lb/>
            officers, marched all night away from the sea, and halted <lb/>
            his men for rest near the temple of Apollo. At this place <lb/>
            Olympus is more than ten furlongs high: and this is <lb/>
            proved by the epigram which the measurer wrote as <lb/>
            follows: <note type="footnote">« The height of Olympus' crest at the temple of Pythian Apollo <lb/>
            consists of (measured by the ,plumb line) ten stades, and besides a <lb/>
            hundred feet all but four. It was Xenagoras, the son of Eumelus, who </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="440"/>
            discovered its height King Apollo, hail to thee; be thou <unclear>propitius</unclear> <lb/>
            to us." <lb/>
            And yet geometricians say that neither the height of any <lb/>
            mountain nor the depth of any sea is above ten stades <lb/>
            (furlongs). However, Xenophanes did not take its alti­ <lb/>
            tude conjecturally, but by a proper method with instru­ <lb/>
            ments.</p>
          <p>XVI. Here then Nasica halted. Perseus in the morning <lb/>
            saw Æmilius’s army quiet in its place, and would have <lb/>
            had no idea of what was going on had not a Cretan <lb/>
            deserter come and told him of the flank march of the <lb/>
            Romans. Then he became alarmed, but still did not <lb/>
            disturb his camp, but, placing ten thousand foreign <lb/>
            mercenaries and two thousand Macedonians under the <lb/>
            command of Milo, ordered him to march swiftly and <lb/>
            occupy the passes. Now Polybius says that the Romans <lb/>
            fell upon these men when they were in their beds, but <lb/>
            Nasica tells us that a sharp and dangerous conflict took <lb/>
            place upon the heights. He himself was assailed by a <lb/>
            Thracian, but struck him through the breast with his <lb/>
            spear. However, the enemy were forced back; Milo most <lb/>
            shamefully fled in his shirt, without his arms, and Scipio <lb/>
            was able to follow, and at the same time lead his forces on <lb/>
            to level ground. Perseus, terrified and despairing when <lb/>
            he saw them, at once broke up his camp and retreated. <lb/>
            But still he was obliged either to give battle before <lb/>
            Pydna, or else to disperse his army among the various <lb/>
            cities of the kingdom, and so to await the Romans, who, <lb/>
            being once entered into his country, could not be driven <lb/>
            out without much slaughter and bloodshed. It was <lb/>
            urged by his friends that he had a great numerical <lb/>
            superiority, and that the troops would fight desperately <lb/>
            in defence of their wives and families, especially if their <lb/>
            king took the command and shared their danger. He <lb/>
            pitched his camp and prepared for battle, viewed the <lb/>
            ground, and arranged the commands, intending to set <lb/>
            upon the Romans as soon as they appeared. N ow the <lb/>
            position both possessed a flat plain for the manoeuvres of <lb/>
            the phalanx, which requires level ground, and also hills <lb/>
            rising one above another offered refuges and means for <lb/>
            outflanking the enemy to his light troops. Also two <lb/>
             <pb n="441"/>
            rivers, the Æson and Leukus, which ran acivss it, though <lb/>
            not very deep at that season (late autumn), were expected <lb/>
            to give some trouble to the Romans.</p>
          <p>XVII. Æmilius, on effecting a junction with Nasica, <lb/>
            marched in battle array against the enemy. When, <lb/>
            however, he saw their position and their numbers, he <lb/>
            halted in surprise, considering within himself what he <lb/>
            should do. His young officers, eager for battle, rode up <lb/>
            to him and begged him not to delay. Conspicuous among <lb/>
            these was Nasica, excited by his successful flank march <lb/>
            round Olympus. AEmilius smiled at them and answered, <lb/>
            " I would do so if I were of your age, but many victories <lb/>
            have shown me the mistakes of the vanquished, and <lb/>
            prevent my attacking a body of men drawn up in a <lb/>
            chosen position with troops on the march and undeployed." <lb/>
            He gave orders that those troops who were in front should <lb/>
            gather together and appear to be forming in battle <lb/>
            array, while those who were behind pitched their palisades <lb/>
            and fortified a camp. Then by wheeling off men by <lb/>
            degrees from the front line, he gradually broke up his <lb/>
            line of battle, and quietly drew all his forces within the <lb/>
            ramparts of his camp. When night fell, and after supper <lb/>
            the army had betaken itself to sleep and rest, suddenly <lb/>
            the moon, which was full and high in the heavens, <lb/>
            became obscured, changed colour, and became totally <lb/>
            eclipsed. The Romans, after their custom, called for her <lb/>
            to shine again by clattering with brass vessels, and <lb/>
            uplifting blazing faggots and torches. The Macedonians <lb/>
            did nothing of the sort, but dismay spread over their camp, <lb/>
            and they muttered under their breath that this portended <lb/>
            the eclipse of their king. Now Æmilius was not unac­ <lb/>
            quainted with the phenomena of eclipses, which result <lb/>
            from the moon being at fixed periods brought into the <lb/>
            shadow of the earth and darkened, until it passes the <lb/>
            obscured tract and is again enlightened by the sun, yet <lb/>
            being very devout and learned in divination, he offered <lb/>
            to her a sacrifice of eleven calves. At daybreak he <lb/>
            sacrificed twenty oxen to Herakles without obtaining a <lb/>
            favourable response; but with the one-and-twentieth <lb/>
            favourable signs appeared and portents of victory fur <lb/>
            them, pruvided they did not attack. He then vowed a <lb/>
             <pb n="442"/>
            hecatomb and sacred games in honour of the god, and <lb/>
            ordered his officers to arrange the men in line of battle. <lb/>
            But he waited till the sun declined and drew towards the <lb/>
            west, that his troops might not fight with the morning <lb/>
            sun in their eyes. He passed away the day sitting in his <lb/>
            tent, which was pitched looking towards the flat country <lb/>
            and the camp of the enemy.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Some writers tell us, that about evening, by <lb/>
            a device of AEmilius, the battle was begun by the enemy, <lb/>
            the Romans having driven a horse without a bridle out <lb/>
            of their camp and then tried to catch it, from which <lb/>
            pursuit the battle began; but others say that Roman <lb/>
            soldiers who were carrying fodder for the cattle were set <lb/>
            upon by the Thracians under Alexander, and that to repel <lb/>
            them a vigorous sortie was made with seven hundred <lb/>
            Ligurians; that many on both sides came up to help their <lb/>
            comrades, and so the battle began. AEmilius, like a pilot, <lb/>
            seeing by the motion and disturbance of his camp that a <lb/>
            storm was at hand, came out of his tent, and going along <lb/>
            the lines of the infantry spoke encouraging words to <lb/>
            them, while Nasica, riding up to the skirmishers, saw the <lb/>
            whole army of the enemy just on the point of attacking. <lb/>
            First marched the Thracians, whose aspect they saw was <lb/>
            most terrible, as they were tall men, dressed in dark <lb/>
            tunics, with large oblong shields and greaves of glittering <lb/>
            white, brandishing aloft long heavy swords over their <lb/>
            right shoulders. Next to the Thracians were the merce­ <lb/>
            naries, variously armed, and mixed with Pæonians. After <lb/>
            these came a third corps, of Macedonians, picked men of <lb/>
            proved courage, and in the flower of their age, glittering <lb/>
            with gilded arms and new purple dresses. Behind them <lb/>
            again came the phalanxes from the camp with their brazen <lb/>
            shields, filling all the plain with the glittering of their <lb/>
            armour, and making the hills ring with their shouts. So <lb/>
            swiftly and boldly did they advance that those who were <lb/>
            first slain fell two furlongs only from the Roman camp.</p>
          <p>XIX. When the battle began, Æmilius came up, and <lb/>
            found the front ranks of the Macedonians had struck their <lb/>
            spear-heads into the Roman shields, so that they could <lb/>
            not reach them with their swords. When also the other <lb/>
            Macedonians took their shields off their shoulders and <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            placed them in front, and then at the word of command all <lb/>
            brought down their pikes, he, viewing the great strength <lb/>
            of that serried mass of shields, and the menacing look <lb/>
            of the spears that bristled before them, was amazed and <lb/>
            terrified, having never seen a more imposing spectacle­ <lb/>
            and often afterwards he used to speak of that sight, and <lb/>
            of his own feelings at it. At the time, however, he put <lb/>
            on a cheerful and hopeful look, and rode along the ranks <lb/>
            showing himself to the men without helmet or cuirass. <lb/>
            But the Macedonian king, according to Polybius, having <lb/>
            joined battle, was seized with a fit of cowardice, and rode <lb/>
            off to the city on the pretext that he was going to <lb/>
            sacrifice to Herakles, a god unlikely to receive the base <lb/>
            offerings of cowards or to fulfil their unreasonable prayers; <lb/>
            for it is not reasonable that he who does not shoot should <lb/>
            hit the mark, nor that he who does not stand fast at his <lb/>
            post should win the day, or that the helpless man should <lb/>
            succeed or the coward prosper. But the god heard the <lb/>
            prayers of AEmilius, for he prayed for victory whilst <lb/>
            fighting, sword in hand, and invited the god into the <lb/>
            battle to aid him. Not but what one Poseidonius, who <lb/>
            says that he took part in these transactions, and wrote a <lb/>
            history of Perseus in many volumes, says that it was not <lb/>
            from cowardice, or on the pretext of offering sacrifice that <lb/>
            he left the field, but that on the day before the battle be <lb/>
            was kicked on the leg by a horse; that in the battle, <lb/>
            though in great pain, and entreated by his friends to <lb/>
            desist, he ordered a horse to be brought, and without <lb/>
            armour rode up to the phalanx. Here as many missiles <lb/>
            were flying about from both sides, an iron javelin struck <lb/>
            him, not fairly with its point, but it ran obliquely down <lb/>
            his left side, tearing his tunic, and causing a dark bruise <lb/>
            on his flesh, the scar of which was long visible. This is <lb/>
            what Poseidonius urges in defence of Perseus.</p>
          <p>XX. Now as the Romans when they met the phalanx <lb/>
            could make no impression upon it, Salovius, the leader of <lb/>
            the Pelignians, seized the standard of his regiment and <lb/>
            threw it among the enemy. The Pelignians, as the loss <lb/>
            of a standard is thought to be a crime and an impiety by <lb/>
            all Italians, rushed to the place, and a fierce conflict <lb/>
            begin there with terrible slaughter. The one party <lb/>
             <pb n="444"/>
            tried to dash aside the long spears with their swords, <lb/>
            and to push them with their shields, and to seize them <lb/>
            away with their very hands, while the Macedonians, <lb/>
            wielding their spears with both hands, drove them <lb/>
            through their opponents, armour and all: for no shield <lb/>
            or corslet could resist their thrust. They then cast over <lb/>
            their own heads the bodies of these Pelignians and <lb/>
            Marrucini, who pressed madly like wild creatures up <lb/>
            to the line of spears and certain death. When the first <lb/>
            rank fell in this manner, those behind gave way: it <lb/>
            cannot be said that they fled, but they retreated to a <lb/>
            mountain called Olokrus. Poseidonius tells us that <lb/>
            Æmilius tore his clothes in despair at seeing these men <lb/>
            give ground, while the other Romans were confounded <lb/>
            at the phalanx, which could not be assailed, but with its <lb/>
            close line of spears, like a palisade, offered no point for <lb/>
            attack. But when he saw that, from the inequalities <lb/>
            of the ground, and the length of their line, the Mace­ <lb/>
            donian phalanx did not preserve its alignment, and was <lb/>
            breaking into gaps and breaches, as is natural should <lb/>
            happen in a great army, according to the different attacks <lb/>
            of the combatants, who made it bulge inwards in one <lb/>
            place, and outward in another, then he came swiftly <lb/>
            up, and dividing his men into companies, ordered <lb/>
            them to force their way into the spaces and intervals of <lb/>
            the enemy's line, and to make their attack, not in any <lb/>
            one place all together, but in several, as they were broken <lb/>
            up into several bodies. As soon as AEmilius had given <lb/>
            these instructions to the officers, who communicated them <lb/>
            to the men, they charged into the spaces, and at once <lb/>
            some attacked the now helpless Macedonians in flank, <lb/>
            while others got into their rear and cut them off. The <lb/>
            phalanx dissolved immediately, and with it was lost all <lb/>
            the power and mutual assistance which it gave. Fighting <lb/>
            in single combats or small groups, the Macedonians struck <lb/>
            in vain with their little daggers at the strong shields <lb/>
            reaching to their feet carried by the Romans. Their <lb/>
            light targets could ill ward off the blows of the Roman <lb/>
            sword, which cut right through all their defensive <lb/>
            armour. After a useless resistance they turned and fled.</p>
          <p>XXI. But the fight was a sharp one. Here Marcus, <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            the son of Cato, Æmilius’s son-in-law, whilst fighting with <lb/>
            great valour let fall his sword. Educated as he had been <lb/>
            in the strictest principles of honour, and owing it to such <lb/>
            a father to give extraordinary proofs of courage, he <lb/>
            thought that life would be intolerable for him if he <lb/>
            allowed an enemy to carry off such a trophy from him, <lb/>
            and ran about calling upon every friend or acquaintance <lb/>
            whom he saw to help him to recover it. Many brave <lb/>
            men thus assembled, and with one accord left the rest <lb/>
            of the army and followed him. After a sharp conflict <lb/>
            and much slaughter, they succeeded in driving the enemy <lb/>
            from the ground, and having thus chased it, they betook <lb/>
            themselves to searching for the sword. When at last <lb/>
            after much trouble it was found among the heaps of arms <lb/>
            and corpses, they were overjoyed, and with a shout <lb/>
            assailed those of the enemy who still resisted. At length <lb/>
            the three thousand picked men were all slain fighting <lb/>
            in their ranks. A great slaughter took place among <lb/>
            the others as they fled, so that the plain and the skirts of <lb/>
            the hills were covered with corpses, and the stream of <lb/>
            the river Leukus ran red with blood even on the day <lb/>
            after the battle; for, indeed, it is said that more than <lb/>
            twenty-five thousand men perished. Of the Romans <lb/>
            there fell a hundred, according to Poseidonius, but Nasica <lb/>
            says only eighty.</p>
          <p>XXII. This battle, fraught with such important issues, <lb/>
            was decided in a remarkably short time; beginning to <lb/>
            fight at the ninth hour, the Romans were victorious before <lb/>
            the tenth. The remainder of the day was occupied in <lb/>
            pursuit, which being pressed for some fifteen (English) <lb/>
            miles, it was late before they returned to their camp. <lb/>
            All the officers on their return were met by their servants <lb/>
            with torches, and conducted with songs of triumph to <lb/>
            their tents, which were illuminated and wreathed with <lb/>
            ivy and laurel; but the general himself was deeply <lb/>
            dejected. The youngest of the two sons who were serving <lb/>
            under him—his own favourite, the noblest of all his <lb/>
            children in character-was nowhere to be found; and it <lb/>
            was feared that, being high-spirited and generous, though <lb/>
            but a boy in years, he must have become mixed up with <lb/>
            the enemy, and so perished. The whole army learned the <lb/>
             <pb n="446"/>
            cause of his sorrow and perplexity, and quitting their <lb/>
            suppers, ran about with torches, some to the tent of <lb/>
            Æmilius, and some outside the camp to look for him <lb/>
            among the corpses. The whole camp was filled with <lb/>
            sorrow, and all the plain with noise, covered as it was <lb/>
            with men shouting for Scipio—for he had won all hearts <lb/>
            from the very beginning, having beyond all his kinsfolk <lb/>
            the power of commanding the affections of men. Very <lb/>
            late at night, after he had been all but given up for lost, <lb/>
            he came in with two or three comrades, covered with the <lb/>
            blood of the enemies hE had slain, having, like a well-bred <lb/>
            hound, been thoughtle sly carried along by the joy of the <lb/>
            chase. This was that Scipio who afterwards took by <lb/>
            storm Carthage and Numantia, and became by far the <lb/>
            most famous and powerful of all the Romans of his time. <lb/>
            So fortune, deferring to another season the expression of <lb/>
            her jealousy at his success, now permitted AEmilius to <lb/>
            take an unalloyed pleasure in his victory.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Perseus fled from Pydna to Pella, his cavalry <lb/>
            having, as one would expect, all got safe out of the action. <lb/>
            But when the infantry met them, they abused them as <lb/>
            cowards and traitors, and began to push them from their <lb/>
            horses and deal them blows, and so Perseus, terrified at the <lb/>
            disturbance, forsook the main road, and to avoid detection <lb/>
            took off his purple robe and laid it before him, and carried <lb/>
            his crown in his hand; and, that he might talk to his friends <lb/>
            as he walked, he got off his horse, and led him. But one <lb/>
            of them made excuse that he must tie his shoes, another <lb/>
            that he must water his horse, another that he must get <lb/>
            himself a drink, and so they gradually fell off from him <lb/>
            and left him, not fearing the rage of the enemy so much <lb/>
            as his cruelty: for, exasperated by his defeat, he tried tc <lb/>
            fasten the blame of it upon others instead of himself. <lb/>
            When he came to Pella, his treasurers Euktus and Eulæus <lb/>
            met him and blamed him for what had happened, and in <lb/>
            an outspoken and unseasonable way gave him advice : at <lb/>
            which he was so much enraged that he stabbed them both <lb/>
            dead with his dagger. After this no one stayed with him <lb/>
            except Evander a Cretan, Archedamus an iEtolian, and <lb/>
            Neon a Bœotian. Of the common soldiers the Cretans <lb/>
            followed him, not from any love they bore him, but being <lb/>
             <pb n="447"/>
            as eager for his riches as bees are for honey. For he <lb/>
            carried great store of wealth with him, and out of it dis­ <lb/>
            tributed among the Cretans cups and bowls and other <lb/>
            gold and silver plate to the amount of fifty talents. But <lb/>
            when he reached first Amphipolis, and then Galepsus, and <lb/>
            had got a little the better of his fears, his old malady of <lb/>
            meanness attacked him, and he would complain to his <lb/>
            friends that he had flung some of the drinking cups of <lb/>
            Alexander the Great to the Cretans by mistake, and en­ <lb/>
            treated with tears those who had them to give back and <lb/>
            take the value in money. Those who understood his cha­ <lb/>
            racter were not taken in by this attempt to play the <lb/>
            Cretan with men of Crete, but some believed him and lost <lb/>
            their cups for nothing. For he never paid the money, but <lb/>
            having swindled his friends out of thirty talents, which <lb/>
            soon fell into the hands of the enemy, he sailed with the <lb/>
            money to Samothrace, and took sanctuary in the temple of <lb/>
            the Dioskuri as a suppliant.</p>
          <p>XXIV. The people of Macedon have always been <lb/>
            thought to love their kings, but now, as if some main prop <lb/>
            had broken, and the whole edifice of government fallen to <lb/>
            the ground, they gave themselves up to Æmilius, and in <lb/>
            two days constituted him master of the entire kingdom. <lb/>
            This seems to confirm the opinion of those who say that <lb/>
            these successes were owing to especial good fortune: and <lb/>
            the incident of the sacrifice also was clearly sent from <lb/>
            Heaven. For when AEmilius was offering sacrifice at Am­ <lb/>
            phipolis, when the sacred ritos had been performed, light­ <lb/>
            ning came down upon the altar, and burned up the otter­ <lb/>
            ing. But in its miraculous character and good luck the <lb/>
            swiftness with which the news spread surpasses all these ; <lb/>
            for on the fourth day after Perseus had been vanquished <lb/>
            at Pydna, while the people at Rome were assembled at a <lb/>
            horse race, suddenly there arose amongst them a rumour <lb/>
            that Æmilius had defeated Perseus in a great battle and <lb/>
            had subdued all Macedonia. This report soon spread among <lb/>
            the populace, who expressed their joy by applause and <lb/>
            shouts throughout the city all that day. Afterwards, as <lb/>
            the report could be traced to no trustworthy source, but <lb/>
            was merely repeated among them vaguely, it was dis­ <lb/>
            believed and came to nothing; but in a few days they <lb/>
             <pb n="448"/>
            learned the real story, and wondered at the rumour which <lb/>
            had preceded it, combining truth with falsehood.</p>
          <p>XXV. There is a legend that the news of the battle on <lb/>
            the river Sagra in Italy against the natives was carried <lb/>
            the same day into Peloponnesus, and that of the battle of <lb/>
            Mykale against the Medes was so carried to Platæa. <lb/>
            The victory of the Romans over the Latins under the <lb/>
            exiled Tarquins was reported at Rome a little after it took <lb/>
            place, by two men, tall and fair, who came from the army. <lb/>
            These men they conjectured to have been the Dioskuri <lb/>
            (Castor and Pollux). The first man who fell in with <lb/>
            them as they stood in the forum, near the fountain, found <lb/>
            them washing their horses, which were covered with <lb/>
            sweat. He marvelled much at their tale of the victory ; <lb/>
            and then they are said to have smiled serenely and stroked <lb/>
            his beard, which instantly changed from black to yellow, <lb/>
            thus causing his story to be believed, besides winning for <lb/>
            him the soubriquet of Ahenobarbus, which means ‛ brazen <lb/>
            beard.' But that which happened in our own time will <lb/>
            make all these credible. When Antonius rebelled against <lb/>
            Domitian, and a great war in Germany was expected, <lb/>
            Rome was greatly disturbed till suddenly there arose <lb/>
            among the people a rumour of victory, and a story ran <lb/>
            through Rome that Antonius himself was killed, and that <lb/>
            the army under him had been utterly exterminated. And <lb/>
            this report was so clear and forcible, that many of the <lb/>
            magistrates offered sacrifice for the victory. When the <lb/>
            originator of it was sought for, as he could not be found, <lb/>
            but the story when traced from one man to another was <lb/>
            lost in the vast crowd as if in the sea, and appeared to <lb/>
            have no solid foundation, all belief in it died away: but <lb/>
            when Domitian set out with his forces to the war, he was <lb/>
            met on the way by messengers with despatches describing <lb/>
            the victory. The day of this success was the same as <lb/>
            that stated by the rumours, though the places were more <lb/>
            than two thousand five hundred (English) miles distant. <lb/>
            All men of our own time know this to be true.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Cnæus Octavius, the admiral under Æmilius’s <lb/>
            orders, now cruised round Samothrace. He did not, from <lb/>
            religious motives, violate Perseus's right of sanctuary, <lb/>
            but prevented his leaving the island and escaping. But <lb/>
             <pb n="449"/>
            nevertheless Perseus somehow outwitted him so far as to <lb/>
            bribe one Oroandes, a Cretan, who possessed a small <lb/>
            vessel, to take him on board. But this man like a true <lb/>
            Cretan took the money away by night, and bidding him <lb/>
            come the next night with his family and attendants to <lb/>
            the harbour near the temple of Demeter, as soon as evening <lb/>
            fell, set sail. Now Perseus suffered pitiably in forcing <lb/>
            himself, and his wife and children, who were unused to <lb/>
            hardships, through a narrow window in the wall, and set <lb/>
            up a most pitiful wailing when some one who met him <lb/>
            wandering on the beach showed him the ship of Oroandes <lb/>
            under sail far away at sea. Day was now breaking, and <lb/>
            having lost his last hope, he made a hasty retreat to the <lb/>
            town wall, and got into it with his wife, before the <lb/>
            Romans, though they saw him, could prevent him. But <lb/>
            his children he had entrusted to a man named Ion, who <lb/>
            once had been a favourite of his, but now betrayed him, <lb/>
            and delivered them up to the Romans, thus providing the <lb/>
            chief means to compel him, like a wild animal, to come and <lb/>
            surrender himself into the hands of those who had his <lb/>
            children. He felt most confidence in Nasica, and inquired <lb/>
            for him, but as he was not present, after lamenting his fate, <lb/>
            and reflecting on the impossibility of acting otherwise, he <lb/>
            surrendered himself to Cnaeus.</p>
          <p>Now he was able to prove that he had a vice yet more <lb/>
            sordid than avarice, namely, base love of life; by which <lb/>
            he lost even his title to pity, the only’ consolation of <lb/>
            which fortune does not deprive the fallen. He begged <lb/>
            to be brought into the presence of AEmilius, who, to show <lb/>
            respect to a great man who had met with a terrible <lb/>
            misfortune, rose, and walked to meet him with his friends, <lb/>
            with tears in his eyes. But Perseus offered a degrading <lb/>
            spectacle by flinging himself down upon his face and <lb/>
            embracing his knees, with unmanly cries and entreaties, <lb/>
            which Æmilius could not endure to listen to; but looking <lb/>
            on him with a pained and sad expression, said, “ Wretched <lb/>
            man: why do you by this conduct deprive fortune of all <lb/>
            blame, by making yourself seem to deserve your mishaps, <lb/>
            and to have been unworthy of your former prosperity, <lb/>
            but worthy of your present misery? And why do you <lb/>
            depreciate the value of my victory, and make my success <note type="footnote"> 2 G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="450"/>
            a small one, by proving degenerate and an unworthy <lb/>
            antagonist for Romans? Valour, however unfortunate, <lb/>
            commands great respect even from enemies: but the <lb/>
            Romans despise cowardice, even though it be prosperous."</p>
          <p>XXVII. However, he raised him from the ground, <lb/>
            and, having given him his hand, he entrusted him to <lb/>
            Tubero, and then taking into his own tent his sons, sons- <lb/>
            in-law, and most of the younger officers, he sat silent, <lb/>
            wrapt in thought for some time, to their astonishment. <lb/>
            Then he said, "Ought a man to be confident that he <lb/>
            deserves his good fortune, and think much of himself <lb/>
            when he has overcome a nation, or city, or empire; or <lb/>
            does fortune give this as an example to the victor also of <lb/>
            the uncertainty of human affairs, which never continue <lb/>
            in one stay ? For what time can there be for us mortals <lb/>
            to feel confident, when our victories over others especially <lb/>
            compel us to dread fortune, and while we are exulting, <lb/>
            the reflection that the fatal day comes now to one, now to <lb/>
            another, in regular succession, dashes our joy. Can we, <lb/>
            who in less than an hour have trampled under our feet <lb/>
            the successor of Alexander the Great, who was so powerful <lb/>
            and mighty, and who see these kings who but lately were <lb/>
            guarded by their tens of thousands of foot and thousands <lb/>
            of horse, now receiving their daily bread from the hands <lb/>
            of their foes, can we suppose that our present prosperity <lb/>
            is likely to endure for all time? You, young men, be <lb/>
            sure that you lay aside your haughty looks and vainglory <lb/>
            in your victory, and await with humility what the future <lb/>
            may bring forth, ever considering what form of retribution <lb/>
            Heaven may have in store for us to set off against our <lb/>
            present good fortune." They say that AEmilius spoke <lb/>
            long in this strain, and sent away his young officers with <lb/>
            their pride and boastfulness well curbed and restrained <lb/>
            by his words, as though with a bridle.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. After these events he sent the army into <lb/>
            cantonments, to rest, and he himself set out to visit <lb/>
            Greece, making a progress which was both glorious and <lb/>
            beneficent; for in the cities to which he came he restored <lb/>
            the popular constitutions, and bestowed on them presents <lb/>
            from the king's treasury, of corn and oil. For so much, <lb/>
            they say, was found stored up, that all those who received <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            it and asked for it, were satisfied before the mass could be <lb/>
            exhausted. At Delphi, seeing a large square column of <lb/>
            white marble, on which a golden statue of Perseus was to <lb/>
            have been placed, he ordered his own to be placed there, <lb/>
            as the vanquished ought to give place to the victors. <lb/>
            At Olympia, as the story goes, he uttered that well- <lb/>
            known saying, that Pheidias had carved the very Zeus <lb/>
            of Homer.</p>
          <p>When ten commissioners arrived from Rome, he restored <lb/>
            to the Macedonians their country to dwell in, and their <lb/>
            cities free and independent, imposing upon them a tribute <lb/>
            of a hundred talents, only half what they used to pay to <lb/>
            their kings. He exhibited gymnastic spectacles of every <lb/>
            kind, and gave splendid sacrifices and feasts in honour <lb/>
            of the gods, having boundless resources for the purpose <lb/>
            in the king's treasury; and in ordering and arranging <lb/>
            each man'a place at table, and saluting him according to <lb/>
            his merit and degree, he showed such a delicate perception <lb/>
            of propriety, that the Greeks were astonished that he <lb/>
            should carry his administrative talent even into his <lb/>
            amusements, and be so business-like in trifles. But he <lb/>
            was always delighted that though many splendid things <lb/>
            were prepared, he himself was the chief object of interest <lb/>
            to his guests, and when they expressed their surprise at <lb/>
            his taking such pains, he would answer that the same <lb/>
            mind can array an army for battle in the most terrific <lb/>
            fashion, or a feast in the most acceptable one. All men <lb/>
            praised to the skies his generous magnanimity, because, <lb/>
            when a great mass of gold and silver was collected from <lb/>
            the king's treasury, he would not so much as look at it, <lb/>
            but handed it over to the quæstors to be put into the <lb/>
            public treasury. Of all the spoil, be only allowed his <lb/>
            sons, who were fond of reading, to take the king's books; <lb/>
            and when distributing prizes for distinguished bravery <lb/>
            in action, he gave Ælius Tubero, his son-in-law, a silver <lb/>
            cup of five pounds' weight. This Tubero is he whom we <lb/>
            said lived with fifteen other kinsfolk on a small farm, which <lb/>
            supported them all. And that, they say, was the first <lb/>
            piece of plate that ever was seen in the Ælian household, <lb/>
            brought there by honourable valour; for before that neither <lb/>
            they nor their wives used either gold or silver plate. <note type="footnote"> 2 G 2 </note></p><pb n="452"/>
            
          <p>XXIX. When he had settled all things properly he <lb/>
            took leave of the Greeks, and reminding the Macedonians <lb/>
            to keep by orderly and unanimous conduct the liberty <lb/>
            which the Romans had bestowed upon them, he started <lb/>
            for Epirus, as the Senate had passed a decree that the <lb/>
            soldiers who had been present in the battle against Perseus <lb/>
            should be gratified with the spoil of the cities of Epirus. <lb/>
            Desiring therefore to fall upon them all at once and <lb/>
            unexpectedly, he sent for ten of the chief men from each <lb/>
            city, and ordered them to bring together, on a fixed day, <lb/>
            all the gold and silver which they had in their houses and <lb/>
            temples. With each party he sent, as if for this purpose, <lb/>
            a guard of soldiers and a captain, who was to pretend that <lb/>
            he came to seek for and receive the money. But when <lb/>
            day broke, they all at the same time fell to sacking and <lb/>
            plundering the cities, so that, in one hour, a hundred and <lb/>
            fifty thousand people were reduced to slavery, and seventy <lb/>
            cities plundered; yet from such ruin and destruction as <lb/>
            this, there resulted no more than eleven drachmae for each <lb/>
            soldier, while all mankind shuddered at this termination <lb/>
            of the war, that a whole nation should be cut to pieces to <lb/>
            produce such a pitiful present.</p>
          <p>XXX. AEmilius, having performed this work, greatly <lb/>
            against his real nature, which was kind and gentle, <lb/>
            proceeded to Oricum, and thence crossed to Italy with his <lb/>
            army. He himself sailed up the river Tiber in the king's <lb/>
            own ship of sixteen banks of oars, adorned with the arms <lb/>
            of the vanquished, and crowns of victory and crimson flags, <lb/>
            so that all the people of Rome came out in a body as if to <lb/>
            a foretaste of the spectacle of his triumphal entry, and <lb/>
            walked beside his ship as she was gently rowed up the <lb/>
            river. But the soldiery, casting longing glances at the <lb/>
            king's treasure, like men who had not met with their <lb/>
            deserts, were angry and dissatisfied with Æmilius; for this <lb/>
            reason really, though the charge they openly put forward <lb/>
            was that he was a harsh and tyrannical ruler: so they <lb/>
            showed no eagerness for the triumph.</p>
          <p>Servius Galba,* an enemy of AEmilius, who had once <lb/>
            commanded a legion under him, hearing this, plucked up <note type="footnote"> 0 He had been military tribune of the second legion in Macedonia. <lb/>
            Liv. xlv. 35. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="453"/>
            spirit to propose openly that he should not be allowed a <lb/>
            triumph. He disseminated among the soldiers many <lb/>
            calumnies against their general, and so still more exas­ <lb/>
            perately their present temper; next he asked the tribunes <lb/>
            of the plebs for another day, as that day would not suffice <lb/>
            for his speech, only four hours remaining of it. However, <lb/>
            the tribunes bade him speak, and he, beginning a long <lb/>
            and abusive speech, consumed all the time. At nightfall <lb/>
            the tribunes dismissed the assembly. But the soldiers, <lb/>
            now grown bolder, assembled round Galba, and, forming <lb/>
            themselves into an organized body, again at daybreak <lb/>
            occupied the capitol; for it was thither that the tribunes <lb/>
            had summoned the people.</p>
          <p>XXXI. The voting began as soon as it was day, and <lb/>
            the first tribe voted against the triumph. Soon the <lb/>
            rumour of this spread to the rest of the people and to the <lb/>
            Senate. Though the masses were grieved at the shameful <lb/>
            treatment of Æmilius, they exhausted themselves in <lb/>
            useless clamour, but the leading men of the Senate crying <lb/>
            out one to another that what was going on was scandalous, <lb/>
            encouraged each other to resist the licentious violence of <lb/>
            the soldiers, who, if not restrained, were ready to use any <lb/>
            kind of lawless violence to prevent Paulus Æmilius enjoy­ <lb/>
            ing the reward of his victory. These men pushed the <lb/>
            mob aside, and mounting to the capitol in a body, bade <lb/>
            the tribunes stop the voting until they had said what <lb/>
            they wished to the people. When voting ceased and <lb/>
            silence was obtained, Marcus Servilius, a man of consular <lb/>
            rank, who had challenged and slain twenty-three enemies <lb/>
            in single combat, spoke as follows :—” What a commander <lb/>
            AEmilius Paulus must be, you are now best able to judge, <lb/>
            seeing with what a disobedient and worthless army he <lb/>
            has succeeded in such great exploits; but I am surprised <lb/>
            at the peopled being proud of the triumphs over the <lb/>
            Illyrians and Ligurians, and begrudging itself the sight <lb/>
            of the king of Macedon brought alive, and all the glories <lb/>
            of Philip and Alexander carried captive to the arms of <lb/>
            Rome. Is it not a strange thing that on the unfounded <lb/>
            rumour of this victory being circulated, you sacrificed <lb/>
            to the gods, praying that you soon might behold this <lb/>
            spectacle, yet now that the army has returned after a real <lb/>
             <pb n="454"/>
            victory, you refuse the gods the honour and yourself the <lb/>
            pleasure of it, as if you feared to see the extent of your <lb/>
            successes, or wished to spare the feelings of your captive <lb/>
            enemy; though it would show a nobler feeling than pity <lb/>
            for him, not to deprive your general of his triumph for a <lb/>
            mean grudge. Your baseness has reached such a pitch <lb/>
            that a man without a scar, with his body delicately <lb/>
            nurtured in the shade, dares to speak about generalship <lb/>
            and triumphs before us who have learned by so many <lb/>
            wounds to judge of a general's vice and virtues." As he <lb/>
            spoke, he opened his clothes, and showed his breast with <lb/>
            an incredible number of scars upon it; then turning to <lb/>
            Galba, who had made some remarks not very decent <lb/>
            " You laugh," said he, " at these other marks : but I glory <lb/>
            in them before my countrymen, for I got them by riding, <lb/>
            night and day, in their service. But come, bring them to <lb/>
            vote ; I will go amongst them and follow them all to the <lb/>
            poll, that I may know those who are cowardly and <lb/>
            ungrateful, and like rather to be ruled by a demagogue <lb/>
            than by a true general."</p>
          <p>XXXII. These words are said to have caused such re­ <lb/>
            morse and repentance among the soldiers, that all the tribes <lb/>
            voted Æmilius his triumph. It is said to have been cele­ <lb/>
            brated thus. The people, dressed in white robes. looked on <lb/>
            from platforms erected in the horse course, which they call <lb/>
            the Circus, and round the Forum; and in all other places <lb/>
            which gave them a view of the procession. Every temple <lb/>
            was open, and full of flowers and incense, and many officials <lb/>
            with staves drove off people who formed disorderly mobs, <lb/>
            and kept the way clear. The procession was divided into <lb/>
            three days. The first scarcely sufficed for the display of <lb/>
            the captured statues, sculptures, and paintings, which <lb/>
            were carried on two hundred and fifty carriages. On the <lb/>
            following day the finest and most costly of the Macedonian <lb/>
            arms and armour were borne along in many waggons, <lb/>
            glittering with newly burnished brass and iron, and <lb/>
            arranged in a carefully studied disorder, helmets upon <lb/>
            shields, and corslets upon greaves, with Cretan targets, <lb/>
            Thracian wicker shields and quivers mixed with horses' <lb/>
            bits, naked swords rising out of these, and the long spears <lb/>
            of the phalanx ranged in order above them, making a har­ <lb/>
             <pb n="455"/>
            monious clash of arms, as they were arranged to clatter <lb/>
            when they weie driven along, with a harsh and menacing <lb/>
            sound, so that the sight of them even after victory was not <lb/>
            without terror. After the waggons which bore the arms <lb/>
            walked three thousand men, carrying the silver coin in <lb/>
            seven hundred and fifty earthen vessels, each carrying <lb/>
            three talents, and borne by four men. Others carried the <lb/>
            silver drinking horns, and goblets and chalices, each of them <lb/>
            disposed so that it could be well seen, and all remarkable <lb/>
            for their size and the boldness of their carving.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. On the third day, at earliest dawn, marched <lb/>
            the trumpeters, not playing the music of a march, but <lb/>
            sounding the notes which animate the Romans for a <lb/>
            charge. After them were led along a hundred and twenty <lb/>
            fat oxen with gilded horns, adorned with crowns and <lb/>
            wreaths. They were led by youths clad in finely-fringed <lb/>
            waistcloths in which to do the sacrifice, while boys <lb/>
            carried the wine for the libations in gold and silver vessels. <lb/>
            After these came men carrying the gold coin, divided into <lb/>
            vessels of three talents each like the silver. The number <lb/>
            of these vessels was eighty all but three. Then came <lb/>
            those who carried the consecrated bowl which Æmilius <lb/>
            had made of ten talents of gold adorned with jewels, and <lb/>
            men carrying the plate of Antigonus and Seleukus, and <lb/>
            cups of Therikles-ware,* and all Perseus's own service of <lb/>
            gold plate.</p>
          <p>Next came the chariot of Perseus with his armour; and <lb/>
            his crown set upon the top of his armour: and then after <lb/>
            a little interval came the captive children of the king, <lb/>
            and with them a tearful band of nurses and teachers, who <lb/>
            held out their hands in supplication to the spectators, and <lb/>
            taught the children to beg them for mercy. There were <lb/>
            two boys and one girl, all too young to comprehend the <lb/>
            extent of their misfortune. This carelessness made their <lb/>
            fallen state all the more pitiable, so that Perseus himself <lb/>
            walked almost unnoticed; for the Romans in their pity <lb/>
            had eyes only for the children, and many shed tears, while <lb/>
            all felt that the sight was more painful than pleasing till <lb/>
            the children were gone by.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Behind the children and their attendants <note type="footnote"> 0 This was a particular kind of pottery, originally made at Corinth. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="456"/>
            walked Perseus himself, dressed in a dark-coloured cloak <lb/>
            with country boots, seeming to be dazed and stupefied by <lb/>
            the greatness of his fall. A band of his friends and <lb/>
            associates followed him with grief-laden countenances, <lb/>
            and, by their constantly looking at Perseus, and weeping, <lb/>
            gave the spectators the idea that they bewailed his fate <lb/>
            without taking any thought about their own. However, <lb/>
            Perseus had sent to Æmilius asking to be excused the <lb/>
            walking in procession; but he, as it seems in mockery of <lb/>
            his cowardice and love of life, answered, 11 That was <lb/>
            formerly in his own hands, and is now if he pleases." <lb/>
            Meaning that death was preferable to dishonour; but the <lb/>
            dastard had not spirit enough for that, but buoyed up by <lb/>
            some hope, became a part of his own spoils.</p>
          <p>After these were borne golden crowns, four hundred in <lb/>
            number, which the cities of Greece had sent to AEmilius <lb/>
            with deputations, in recognition of his success. Next he <lb/>
            came himself, sitting in a splendid chariot, a man worth <lb/>
            looking upon even without his present grandeur, dressed <lb/>
            in a purple robe sprinkled with gold, and holding a branch <lb/>
            of laurel in his right hand. All the army was crowned <lb/>
            with laurel and followed the car of the general in military <lb/>
            array, at one time singing and laughing over old country <lb/>
            songs, then raising in chorus the paean of victory and <lb/>
            recital of their deeds, to the glory of Æmilius, who was <lb/>
            gazed upon and envied by all, disliked by no good man. <lb/>
            Yet it seems that some deity is charged with tempering <lb/>
            these great and excessive pieces of good fortune, and <lb/>
            skimming as it were the cream off human life, so that <lb/>
            none may be absolutely without his ills in this life ; but as <lb/>
            Homer says, they may seem to fare best whose fortune <lb/>
            partakes equally of good and evil.</p>
          <p>XXXV. For he had four sons, two, as has been already <lb/>
            related, adopted into other families, Scipio and Fabius; <lb/>
            and two others who were still children, by his second <lb/>
            wife, who lived in his own house. Of these, one died five <lb/>
            days before JEmilius's triumph, at the age of fourteen, and <lb/>
            the other, twelve years old, died three days after it; so <lb/>
            that there was no Roman that did not grieve for him, and <lb/>
            all trembled at the cruelty of fortune, which had burst <lb/>
            into a house filled with joy and gladness, and mingled <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            tears and funeral dirges with the triumphal paeans and <lb/>
            songs of victory.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Yet Emilius, rightly thinking that courage <lb/>
            is as valuable in supporting misfortunes as it is against <lb/>
            the Macedonian phalanx, so arranged matters as to show <lb/>
            that for him the evil was overshadowed by the good, and <lb/>
            that his private sorrows were eclipsed by the successes of <lb/>
            the state, lest he should detract from the importance and <lb/>
            glory of the victory. He buried the first child, and <lb/>
            immediately afterwards triumphed, as we have said : and <lb/>
            when the second died after the triumph, he assembled the <lb/>
            people and addressed them, not so much in the words of <lb/>
            one who needs consolation, as of one who would console <lb/>
            his countrymen, who were grieved at his misfortunes. <lb/>
            He said, that he never had feared what man could do to <lb/>
            him, but always had feared Fortune, the most fickle and <lb/>
            variable of all deities ; and in the late war she had been <lb/>
            so constantly present with him, like a favouring gale, that <lb/>
            he expected now to meet with some reverse by way of <lb/>
            retribution. " In one day," said he, " I crossed the Ionian <lb/>
            sea from Brundisium to Corcyra; on the fifth day I sacri­ <lb/>
            fleet! at Delphi; in five more I entered upon my command <lb/>
            in Macedonia, performed the usual lustration of the army; <lb/>
            and, at once beginning active operations, in fifteen days <lb/>
            more I brought the war to a most glorious end. I did <lb/>
            not trust in my good fortune as lasting, because every <lb/>
            thing favoured me, and there was no danger to be feared <lb/>
            from the enemy, but it was during my voyage that I <lb/>
            especially feared that the change of fortune would befall <lb/>
            me, after I had conquered so great a host, and was <lb/>
            bearing with me such spoils and even kings as my captives. <lb/>
            However, I reached you safe, and saw the city full of <lb/>
            gladness and admiration and thanksgiving, but still I had <lb/>
            my suspicions about Fortune, knowing that she never <lb/>
            bestows any great kindness unalloyed and without exact­ <lb/>
            ing retribution for it. And no sooner had I dismissed this <lb/>
            foreboding about some misfortune being about to happen <lb/>
            to the state, than I met with this calamity in my own <lb/>
            household, having during these holydays had to bury <lb/>
            my noble sons, one after the other, who, had they lived, <lb/>
            would alone have borne my name.</p><pb n="458"/>
            
          <p>“ Now therefore I fear no further great mischance, and <lb/>
            am of good cheer; for a sufficient retribution has been <lb/>
            exacted from me for my successes, and the triumpher has <lb/>
            been made as notable an example of the uncertainty of <lb/>
            human life as the victim; except that Perseus, though <lb/>
            conquered, still has his children, while Æmilius, his con. <lb/>
            queror, has lost his."</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Such was the noble discourse which they say <lb/>
            ,Emilius from his simple and true heart pronounced before <lb/>
            the people. As to Perseus, though he pitied his fallen <lb/>
            fortunes and was most anxious to help him, all he could <lb/>
            do was to get him removed from the common prison, <lb/>
            called Career by the Romans, to a clean and habitable <lb/>
            lodging, where, in confinement, according to most authors, <lb/>
            he starved himself to death; but some give a strange and <lb/>
            extraordinary account of how he died, saying that the <lb/>
            soldiers who guarded him became angry with him, and not <lb/>
            being able to vex him by any other means, they prevented <lb/>
            his going to sleep, watching him by turns, and so carefully <lb/>
            keeping him from rest by all manner of devices, that at <lb/>
            last he was worn out and died. Two of his children died <lb/>
            also; but the third, Alexander, they say became accom­ <lb/>
            plished in repoussé work and other arts. He learned to <lb/>
            speak and write the Roman language well, and was <lb/>
            employed by the magistrates as a clerk, in which profession <lb/>
            he was much esteemed.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. The most popular thing which .Emilius <lb/>
            did in connection with Macedonia was that he brought <lb/>
            back so much money that the people were not obliged to <lb/>
            pay any taxes till the consulship of Hirtius and Pausa, <lb/>
            during the first war between Antony and Augustus <lb/>
            Cæsar. This was remarkable about AEmilius, that he was <lb/>
            peculiarly respected and loved by the people, though of <lb/>
            the aristocratical party; and though he never said or did <lb/>
            anything to make himself popular, but always in politics <lb/>
            acted with the party of the nobles. Scipio Africanus was <lb/>
            afterwards reproached with this by Appius. These were <lb/>
            the leading men in the city, and were candidates for the <lb/>
            office of Censor: the one with the Senate and nobles to sup­ <lb/>
            port him, that being the hereditary party of the Appii; the <lb/>
            other being a man of mark in himself, and one who ever <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            enjoyed the greatest love and favour with the people. So <lb/>
            when Appius saw Scipio coming into the forum surrounded <lb/>
            by men of low birth and freed men, yet men who knew <lb/>
            the forum, and who could collect a mob and by their <lb/>
            influence and noise could get any measure passed, he <lb/>
            called out, " 0 Paulus AEmilius, groan in your grave, at <lb/>
            your son being brought into the Censorship by Æmilius the <lb/>
            crier and Licinius Philonicus." But Scipio kept the people <lb/>
            in good humour by constantly augmenting their privileges, <lb/>
            whereas iEmilius, though of the aristocratic party, was <lb/>
            no less loved by the people than those who courted their <lb/>
            favour and caressed them. They showed this by electing <lb/>
            him, amongst other dignities, to the Censorship; which <lb/>
            office is most sacred, and confers great power, especially <lb/>
            in examining men's lives; for the Censor can expel a <lb/>
            senator of evil life from his place, and elect the President <lb/>
            of the Senate, and punish licentious young men by taking <lb/>
            away their horses. They also register the value of <lb/>
            property, and the census of the people. In his time they <lb/>
            amounted to three hundred and thirty-seven thousand <lb/>
            four hundred and fifty-two. He appointed Marcus <lb/>
            Æmilius Lepidus President of the Senate, who four times <lb/>
            already had enjoyed that dignity, and he expelled three <lb/>
            senators, not men of mark. With regard to the Equites, <lb/>
            he and his colleague Marcius Philippus showed equal <lb/>
            moderation.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. After most of the labours of his life were <lb/>
            accomplished, he fell sick of a disorder which at first <lb/>
            seemed dangerous, but as time went on appeared not to be <lb/>
            mortal, but wearisome and hard to cure.</p>
          <p>At length he followed the advice of his physicians, and <lb/>
            sailed to Pæstum, in Italy. There he passed his time <lb/>
            chiefly in the peaceful meadows near the sea-shore ; but the <lb/>
            people of Rome regretted his absence, and in the public <lb/>
            theatre often would pray for his return, and speak of <lb/>
            their longing to see him. When the time for some <lb/>
            religious ceremony at which he had to be present ap­ <lb/>
            proached, and he also considered himself sufficiently <lb/>
            strong, he returned to Rome. He performed the sacrifice, <lb/>
            with the other priests, the people surrounding him witb <lb/>
            congratulations. On the next day he again officiated, <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            offering a thank-offering to the gods for his recovery. <lb/>
            When this sacrifice was finished, he went homo and lay <lb/>
            down, and before any one noticed how changed he was, he <lb/>
            fell into a delirious trance, and died in three days, having <lb/>
            in his life wanted none of those things which are thought <lb/>
            to render men happy. Even his funeral procession was <lb/>
            admirable and enviable, and a noble tribute to his valour <lb/>
            and goodness. I do not mean gold, ivory, and other ex­ <lb/>
            pensive and vain-glorious apparatus, but love, honour, <lb/>
            and respect, not only shown by his own countrymen, but <lb/>
            also by foreigners. For of the Iberians, Ligurians, and <lb/>
            Macedonians who happened to be in Rome, the strongest <lb/>
            carried the bier, while the elder men followed after, <lb/>
            praising Æmilius as the saviour and benefactor of their <lb/>
            countries. For he not only during his period of conquest <lb/>
            had treated them mildly and humanely, but throughout <lb/>
            the rest of his life was always bestowing benefits upon <lb/>
            them as persons peculiarly connected with himself. His <lb/>
            estate, they say, scarcely amounted to three hundred and <lb/>
            seventy thousand sesterces,* which he left to be shared <lb/>
            between his two sons ; but Scipio, the younger, consented <lb/>
            to give up his share to his brother, as he was a member of <lb/>
            a rich family, that of Africanus. Such is said to have <lb/>
            been the life and character of Æmilius Paulus. <note type="footnote"> 0 Little more than £3000. </note></p>

            <title type="main">COMPARISON OF PAULUS ÆMILLIUS AND TIMOLEON.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. THE characters of these men being such as is shown <lb/>
            in their histories, it is evident that in comparing them we <lb/>
            shall find few differences and points of variance. Even their <lb/>
            wars were in both cases waged against notable antagonists, <lb/>
            the one with the Macedonians, the other with the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians : while their conquests were glorious, as the one <lb/>
            took Macedonia, and crushed the dynasty of Antigonus in <lb/>
            the person of its seventh king, while the other drove all <lb/>
            the despots from Sicily and set the island free. Unless <lb/>
            indeed any one should insinuate that AEmilius attacked <lb/>
            Perseus when he was in great strength and had conquered <lb/>
            the Romans before, whereas Timoleon fell upon Dionysius <lb/>
            when he was quite worn out and helpless: though again <lb/>
            it might be urged on behalf of Timoleon that he overcame <lb/>
            many despots and the great power of Carthage, with an <lb/>
            army hastily collected from all sources, not, like Æmilius, <lb/>
            commanding men who were inured to war and knew how <lb/>
            to obey, but making use of disorderly mercenary soldiers <lb/>
            who only fought when it pleased them to do so. An <lb/>
            equal success, gained with such unequal means, reflects <lb/>
            the greater credit on the general.</p>
          <p>II. Both were just and incorruptible in their conduct: <lb/>
            but Æmilius seems to have had the advantage of the <lb/>
            customs and state of feeling among his countrymen, by <lb/>
            which he was trained to integrity, while Timoleon with­ <lb/>
            out any such encouragement acted virtuously, from his <lb/>
            own nature. This is proved by the fact that the Romans <lb/>
            of that period were all submissive to authority, and carried <lb/>
            out the traditions of the state, respecting the laws and <lb/>
            the opinions of their countrymen: whereas, except Dion, <lb/>
             <pb n="462"/>
            no Greek leader or general of that time had anything to <lb/>
            do with Sicilian affairs who did not take bribes : though <lb/>
            many suspected than Dion was meditating making himself <lb/>
            king, and that he had dreams of an empire like that of <lb/>
            Sparta.</p>
          <p>Timæus tells us that the Syracusans sent away Gylippus <lb/>
            in disgrace for his insatiable covetousness, and the bribes <lb/>
            which they discovered that he received when in command. <lb/>
            And many writers had dwelt upon the wicked and <lb/>
            treacherous acts which Pharax the Spartan and Kallippus <lb/>
            the Athenian committed, when they were endeavouring <lb/>
            to make themselves masters of Sicily. Yet, what were <lb/>
            they, and what resources had they, that they conceived <lb/>
            such great designs: the one being only a follower of <lb/>
            Dionysius when he was banished from Syracuse, the other <lb/>
            a captain of mercenaries under Dion? But Timoleon, <lb/>
            who was sent to the Syracusans as generalissimo at their <lb/>
            own request and prayer, did not seek for command, but <lb/>
            had a right to it. Yet when he received his power as <lb/>
            general and ruler from them of their own free will, he <lb/>
            voluntarily decided to hold it only till he should have <lb/>
            expelled from Sicily all those who were reigning des­ <lb/>
            potically. In Æmilius again we must admire this, that <lb/>
            he subdued so great an empire and yet did not enrich <lb/>
            himself by one drachma, and never even saw or touched <lb/>
            the king's treasures, although he distributed much of <lb/>
            them in presents to others. And still, I do not say that <lb/>
            Timoleon is to be blamed for having received a fine house <lb/>
            and estate; for there is no disgrace in receiving it by <lb/>
            such means, though not to take it is better, and shows <lb/>
            almost superhuman virtue, which cares not to take what <lb/>
            is lawfully within its reach. Yet, as the strongest bodies <lb/>
            are those which can equally well support the extremes of <lb/>
            heat and cold, so the noblest minds are those which pros­ <lb/>
            perity does not render insolent and overbearing, nor ill <lb/>
            fortune depress: and here Æmilius appears more nearly <lb/>
            to approach absolute perfection, as, when in great mis­ <lb/>
            fortune and grief for his children, he showed the same <lb/>
            dignity and firmness as after the greatest success. <lb/>
            Whereas Timoleon, though he acted towards his brother <lb/>
            as became a noble nature, yet could not support himself <lb/>
             <pb n="463"/>
            against his sorrow by reason, but was so crushed by <lb/>
            remorse and grief that for twenty years he could not ap­ <lb/>
            pear or speak in the public assembly. We ought indeed to <lb/>
            shrink from and feel shame at what is base; but the <lb/>
            nature which is over-cautious to avoid blame may be <lb/>
            gentle and kindly, but cannot be great .</p>
