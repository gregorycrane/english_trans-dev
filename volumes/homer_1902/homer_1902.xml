          </head>
          <p>THE present translation of the Odyssey has been exe <lb/>
            cuted on the same plan as that of the Iliad, to which it <lb/>
            forms the companion-volume. The Hymns and Minor <lb/>
            Hoems are now, for the first time, literally translated, <lb/>
            completing all that has been attributed to Homer. For <lb/>
            these, the editions of Ruhnken, Ernesti, and Hermann <lb/>
            have been principally followed.</p>
          <p>Had the limits of the volume permitted, a more <lb/>
            critical investigation of the various readings and con­ <lb/>
            jectures of scholars would have been given; but the <lb/>
            editor trusts that what has been done will be found suf­ <lb/>
            ficient for the wants of the student.</p>
          <p>The frequent quotations from the brilliant paraphrases <lb/>
            of Chapman, Congreve, and Shelley, cannot, he thinks, <lb/>
            fail to prove interesting to the general reader.</p>
          <p>For the translation of the Pseudo-Herodotean Life of <lb/>
            Homer, the reader is indebted to the industry of Kenneth <lb/>
            Mackenzie, Esq. It is the earliest memoir of the sup­ <lb/>
            posed author of the Iliad we possess, and, as such, merits <lb/>

          <p>HERODOTUS of Halicarnassus,l in the pursuit of truth, writes <lb/>
            this history of the birth and life of Homer.</p>
          <p>I. When, many years ago, the city of Cumæ in Æolia was <lb/>
            built, there flocked to it many persons of the various nations <lb/>
            of Greece, and, among them, were some from Mugnesia2 One <lb/>
            of these was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes, the SOIl of Crito. <lb/>
            This man, far from. possessing riches, had scarcely the means <lb/>
            of subsistence. When settled in Cumae, he married the <lb/>
            daughter of Omyretis. By this marriage, he had one child, <lb/>
            a girl, whom he called Critheïs. The husband and wife both <note type="footnote"> 1 Some editions of the History bore, as we find from Aristotle, (Rhetoric <lb/>
            ii. 9, § 1,) the following variation from our usual superscription or preface : <lb/>
            " This is the exposition of the historical researches of Herodotus of <lb/>
            Taurium," &amp;c. It is to be presumed that the edition which Aristotle <lb/>
            nentioned was one of those revised after his retiring to that town from <lb/>
            Halicarnassus, (now called Budrun,) in the fortieth year of his age, B. c. <lb/>
            441. Thurium was built near the ruins of Sybaris. in Lucania, by some <lb/>
            Athenians. Some say, that the banished Thucydides, (afterwards re­ <lb/>
            called,) and Lysias, son of Cephalus, the celebrated orator, accompanied <lb/>
            Herodotus, (Strabo vi.; Plin. xii. 4; Meta ii. 4,) but this is doubtful </note><note type="footnote"> ' The present Mansa. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VII"/>
            died, leaving this child very young. The father, before his <lb/>
            death, appointed Cleanax of Argos, one of his most intimate <lb/>
            friends, her guardian.</p>
          <p>II. In the course of time, by a secret intrigue, Critheis <lb/>
            found herself with child. This was for some time concealed ; <lb/>
            but Cleanax, having discovered it, was much afflicted by the <lb/>
            occurrence, and privately reproached her with her fault, laying <lb/>
            before her the dishonour she had brought upon herself. To <lb/>
            repair the evil as much as possible, was now the subject of his <lb/>
            thoughts. The inhabitants of Cumæ were at this time build­ <lb/>
            ing a town in the basin of the Hermæan Gulf.3 Theseus4 <lb/>
            wishing to render the name of his wife Immortal, called it <lb/>
            Smyrna. He was a Thessalian, and of one of the most il­ <lb/>
            lustrious families in that country. His father was Eumelus, <lb/>
            eon of Admetus,5 from whom he inherited a considerable <note type="footnote"> ' The present gulf of Smyrna ; the river on which that place is situ­ <lb/>
            ated, then called Meles, now Sarabat or Kedous. Some of the an­ <lb/>
            cients suppose that Homer composed his poems in a cave near the sources <lb/>
            of this river, and thence called his compositions Meletææ chartæ. Strabo <lb/>
            xii.; Stat. ii.; Sylv. vii. 34; Tibull. iv. el. i. 201; Pans. vii. 5. Smyrna <lb/>
            was built by the Cumæans, B. c. 1015. Eratosthenes. Some say that <lb/>
            Smyrna was the name of an Amazon: according to our author, it was <lb/>
            named after the wife of Theseus, of whom mention will presently be made. <lb/>
            Alyattes expelled the Cimmerians from Smyrna. Herodotus i. 16. <lb/>
            Alexander, or, as Strabo affirms, Lysimachus, rebuilt the town, which had <lb/>
            remained ruinous and desolate for four hundred years, i. e. from the time <lb/>
            of Alyattes. Marcus Aurelius repaired the damage done to it by an earth­ <lb/>

            Peisistratus, which seems to attribute the building of Smyrna to the <lb/>
            Athenians. </note><note type="footnote"> * The following is the genealogy of Theseus, omitting the mystical <lb/>

            property. Cleanax conducted Critheis secretly to that town, <lb/>
            and committed her to the charge of Ismenias of Bœotia, a <lb/>
            friend of his, on whom the lot had fallen to go to that colony.</p>
          <p>In. Critheïs, being near her confinement, resorted to a <lb/>
            festival held on the bank of the river Meles, in company with <lb/>
            other women ; while there, the pains of childbirth came upon <lb/>
            her, and she brought forth Homer, who, far from being blind, <lb/>
            had excellent eyes. She named him Melesigenes, having <lb/>
            been born by the river Meles. Critheis remained some time <lb/>
            with Ismenias, but afterwards left him, supporting herself and <lb/>
            son by the work of her hands,7 and upon the proceeds of the <lb/>
            charity of her fellow-citizens, educating the boy as she could.</p>
          <p>IV. There lived at Smyrna, at this time, a man named <lb/>
            Phemius, a teacher of literature and music;8 who not be- <figure type="illustration">

              Aristides (Monodiâ de Smyrnâ) mentions Theseus as one of the founders <lb/>
              of the city, but without further notice. But see Herodotus, (i. 16,) who <lb/>
              says that Smyrna was founded from Colophon. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 It is supposed by Eustathius (Comment, ad II. xii. page 913) that <lb/>

              woman, holds the scale, and weighs the wool by which she lives ; she is <lb/>
              attentive to equalize the balances, so that she may afford her children a <lb/>
              poor subsistence, the price of fatiguing labour." 11. xii. 433—135. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Music was the general term under which the ancients comprehended </note> <lb/>

              ing married, engaged Critheis to manage his household, and <lb/>
              spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic labours. <lb/>
              She acquitted herself of the task so satisfactorily, and con­ <lb/>
              ducted herself so modestly, that she won his esteem. He <lb/>
              proposed to marry her, and, as an inducement to it, promised <lb/>
              to adopt her son, intimating that the boy, carefully edu­ <lb/>
              cated and instructed, would become a clever man; for he <lb/>
              perceived in him a thoughtful and studious disposition. <lb/>
              Critheis, moved by these solicitations, consented to become <lb/>
              his wife.</p>
          <p>V. Care and an excellent education seconding the happy <lb/>
            talents with which nature had endowed him, Melesigenes <lb/>
            soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment, and <lb/>
            when older, he became as wise as his instructor. Phemius <lb/>
            died,9 leaving him heir to his property; his mother did <lb/>
            not long survive her husband. Melesigenes, now his own <lb/>
            master, taught in the school of Phemius, where every one <lb/>
            applauded him. He excited the admiration, not only of <lb/>
            the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of the numerous strangers <lb/>
            who resorted to that port on account of the trade carried on <lb/>
            there, particularly in the exportation of corn, much of which <lb/>
            came from the environs of the town. These, when their bu­ <lb/>
            siness was finished, frequented his school in great numbers.</p>
          <p>VI. Among these strangers, was one whose name was <lb/>
            Mentes. He had come from the island of Leucadia10 to buy <lb/>
            corn; the vessel in which he had arrived was his own ; be <lb/>
            also was a lettered man, and well educated for those times. <note type="footnote"> the knowledge of philosophy, logic, literature, harmonics, and in fact all <lb/>
            that concerns mental culture. Gymnastics was its parallel, as the art of <lb/>

            This man persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and ac­ <lb/>
            company him on his travels. He promised to defray all the <lb/>
            expenses, and give him a certain stipend, telling him that, <lb/>
            while he was young, it was imperative on him to see with his <lb/>
            own eyes the countries and cities of which he might there- <lb/>
            after have occasion to speak. These reasonings prevailed, I <lb/>
            think, the more easily, as he had some idea, at that time, of <lb/>
            devoting himself to the study of poetry, [which would be <lb/>
            facilitated by travel, as his innate prejudices would thereby <lb/>
            be stifled.] He quitted his school, and embarking with <lb/>
            Mentes, examined all the curiosities of the countries which they <lb/>
            visited, and informed himself of every thing by interrogating <lb/>
            every one he met. We may also suppose, that he recorded in <lb/>
            writing all the information he thought worthy of preservation.</p>
          <p>VII. After having traveled in Tyrrhenia and Iberia," <lb/>
            they arrived at the island of Ithaca. Melesigenes, who had <lb/>
            already suffered pains in his eyes, now became much worse. <lb/>
            Mentes, obliged to go to Leueadia, his native country, on <lb/>
            business, left him at Ithaca in the care of a particular friend <lb/>
            of his, called Mentor, the son of Alcimus. He promised <lb/>
            Melesigenes to return to him, that they might continue their <lb/>
            voyages. Mentor's assistance was given to Melesigenes most <lb/>
            zealously. He was rich, and was reputed a just and hos­ <lb/>
            pitable man. It was here, and during this period, that Me­ <lb/>
            lesigenes acquired a knowledge of all the legends respecting <lb/>
            Odysseus. The inhabitants of Ithaea assert "that Mele­ <lb/>
            sigenes became blind in their island." I myself incline to the <lb/>
            opinion, that he was cured of his disease, or that it was alle­ <lb/>
            viated, and that afterwards, when at Colophon, he perma­ <lb/>
            nently lost his sight. And so think the Colophonians.</p>
          <p>VIII. Mentes, having sailed from Leucadia, arrived at <lb/>
            Ithaca. Finding Melesigenes cured, he took him on board, <note type="footnote">11Wesseling throws a doubt on the probability of these voyages, sup­ <lb/>
            porting his assertions by a reference to Herodotus, (i. 163; viii. 132,) <lb/>
            which is refuted by Larcher in his note on the passage. </note> <lb/>

            and proceeded from place to place with him, coming at <lb/>
            length to Colophon. It was there that Melesigenes was <lb/>
            again attacked by the disease, which, raging more malevo­ <lb/>
            lently, left him totally blind. This misfortune determined <lb/>
            him to depart from Colophon, and to return to Smyrna, <lb/>
            where he studied the art of poetry and harmonics with much <lb/>
            attention.</p>
          <p>LX. After some time, the bad state of his affairs induced <lb/>
            him to go to Cumæ. Setting out, he travelled over the Her­ <lb/>
            mæan plain, and arrived at Neon-teichos,12 a colony of <lb/>
            Cumæ. It is related, that being at that city near an armour­ <lb/>
            er's 13 workshop, he recited these, his first verses:</p>
          <p>" O ye, citizens of the amiable daughter of Cumæ,14 who <lb/>
            cover the feet of Mount Sædena with your habitations, <lb/>
            whose summit is shaded by refreshing woods, and whence <lb/>
            flow the waters of divine Hermus, create of Zeus, respect the <lb/>
            misfortunes of a stranger, who possesses no refuge for shelter." <note type="footnote"> 12 See Herod. i. 149. </note><note type="footnote"> 13 Literally, " a currier's yard," but Larcher has been followed in the <lb/>
            translation of the phrase, as the terms are almost synonymous, for the <lb/>
            arms of the Greeks of that period were made of ox-hides, stretched on a <lb/>
            metal frame, and faced with the same material. Thus, in ancient times <lb/>
            the trades were exercised simultaneously. See the description of the <lb/>
            shield of Ajax, (IX. vii. 219,) and Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities. </note><note type="footnote"> 14 See Isaiah xxiii. 12. Paulinus, bishop of Nola, also says, in speak­ <lb/>

            the poetic effect of the verses. These verses are to be found in the Aldine <lb/>
            and Florentine editions. The text of the third verse is corrupt, it runs, <lb/>
            "<foreign xml:lang="grc">ναίετ' ἐς ᾅδην, ἦς πόδα</foreign>." Bernard Martin proposes the following <lb/>
            emendation, " <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναίετε</foreign> ∑<foreign xml:lang="grc">αιδηνη̃ς πόδα</foreign>." Stephen of Byzantium ('<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εθνικά</foreign>, <lb/>
            edit. Westermann, Lips. 1839, 8vo) mentions Mount Sædena, which <lb/>
            makes the reading more probable. Sædena may be a corruption of Sar­ <lb/>
            dena mentioned by older authors, therefore to restore Sardena, as Larcher <lb/>
            does, would be to destroy a proof of the late origin of the Life. This is a <lb/>
            fact worthy of notice in dating the composition of this treatise. Stephen <lb/>
            of Byzantium lived under the reign of Justinian II., therefore this treatise <lb/>
            must have been written some where bout the same time. </note> <pb n="XII"/>

          <p>For the river Hermus flows near Neon-teichos, and Mount <lb/>
            Sædena overlooks both. The name of the armourer was <lb/>
            Tychius. These verses gave him such pleasure that he in­ <lb/>
            vited Melesigenes to his house. Full of commiseration for a <lb/>
            blind man reduced to beggary, he promised to share all that <lb/>
            he had with him. Melesigenes having entered, seated him­ <lb/>
            self, and in the presence of several of the citizens, manifested <lb/>
            his capabilities, by singing the exploits of Amphiaraüs <lb/>
            against Thebes,15 and the Hymns to the gods.16 Each gave <lb/>
            his opinion, and Melesigenes having drawn a just conclusion <lb/>
            from their criticisms, his hearers were struck with admiration.</p>
          <p>X. Whilst at Neon-teichos, his poems furnished him with <lb/>
            the means of subsistence. The place he customarily occupied <lb/>
            during the recitation of his verses is still shown. It is held <lb/>
            in great estimation even now, and is shaded by a poplar <lb/>
            which was planted about the time of his arrival.17</p>
          <p>XI. But at length, compelled by necessity, and finding <lb/>
            scarcely sufficient to keep him alive, he determined to pro­ <lb/>
            ceed to Cumæ, to see if he could meet with better fortune <lb/>
            there. When ready to depart, he recited these verses:</p>
          <p>"May my limbs support me to that honourable town, <lb/>
            whose inhabitants possess no less prudence than sagacity."</p>
          <p>Having departed for Cumæ, he went by way of Larissa, 18 <note type="footnote"> 15 This was probably the poem known by the title of the Thebais, at­ <lb/>

            considering that road the most convenient. It was there, as <lb/>
            the Cumæans say, that he composed the epitaph of Gordius, <lb/>
            king of Phrygia, at the request of the father and mother of <lb/>
            the wife of that prince. It is engraven on the pillar of the <lb/>
            monument of Gordius, where it may yet be seen.</p>

          <p>XII. When Melesigenes arrived at Cumæ, he frequented <lb/>
            the assemblies of the elders, and there recited his verses. <lb/>
            Admiring their beautiful structure, they fell into an ecstasy of <lb/>
            delight. Joyful at the reception his poems had prepared for <lb/>
            him among the Cumæans, and at the pleasure with which <lb/>
            they had heard him, he one day proposed to them, that if the <lb/>
            state would maintain him, he would make the city of Cumæ <lb/>
            very celebrated. His hearers approved of the proposition, <lb/>
            and engaged him to present himself before the council, where <lb/>
            they would support him with all their interest. Melesigenes, <lb/>
            encouraged by their approbation, presented himself at the <lb/>
            House of Assembly on an audience day, and addressing the <lb/>
            person who had the office of presenting those who had any <lb/>
            request to prefer, he begged to be allowed to enter. This <lb/>
            officer did not neglect to present him the first opportunity that <lb/>
            offered. Melesigenes, as soon as that ceremony was over, <lb/>
            addressed the assembly regarding the proposition he had <lb/>
            formerly made. His speech ended, he retired, in order that <note type="footnote"> It Conf. Plat. Phædrus, § 106; Diog. Laert. i. 89. Simonides there at­ <lb/>

            the representatives might deliberate on the answer necessary <lb/>
            to give him.</p>
          <p>XIII. He that presented him, and all those representatives <lb/>
            belonging to the Elders' Assembly, where he had recited, <lb/>
            voted for him. It is said that one only opposed the measure, <lb/>
            giving for his reasons, "that if they thought to feed homers,20 <lb/>
            they would find themselves encumbered with useless folks." <lb/>
            From this time the name of Homer, bestowed thus oppro­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            oriously on Melesigenes in consequence of his misfortune, <lb/>
            was most generally used in speaking of him; for the Cumæ­ <lb/>
            ans, in their dialect, called blind persons homers. Strangers <lb/>
            always used this name in discoursing of the poet.</p>
          <p>XIV. The Archon concluded with saying, " that it was <lb/>
            impolitic to maintain the blind man." This caused the ma­ <lb/>
            jority of the representatives to vote against the measure, the <lb/>
            second time, and thus the Archon obtained more votes than <lb/>
            opposers. The presenting officer communicated with Me­ <lb/>
            lesigenes on the subject, informing him of the progress of the <lb/>
            debate, and of the decree. Deploring his ill fortune, he <lb/>
            recited these verses: " To what sad fate has father Zeus <lb/>

            diction against the Cumæans, to the following effect: " that <lb/>
            there never might be born in Cumæ a poet, who could render <lb/>
            it celebrated, and give it glory." Arrived at PlicaTa, he sup­ <lb/>
            ported himself as he had done at Cumæ and elsewhere, <lb/>
            assiduously frequenting the places of assembly, at which he <lb/>
            recited his verses. There was, at that time, an unprincipled <lb/>
            man named Thestorides at Phocæa, a teacher of the rudi­ <lb/>
            ments of literature. Having observed the talents of Homer, <lb/>
            he offered to shelter and take care of him, if, as a recom­ <lb/>
            pence, Homer would permit him to take down his verses <lb/>
            in writing, and if he would do the same with those he might <lb/>
            hereafter compose. Homer, being poor and destitute, ac­ <lb/>

            Thestorides, he composed the Little Iliad,25 of which the two <lb/>
            first verses are as follows:</p>

            horses,26 and the ills the Greeks, servants of Mars, endured <lb/>

          <p>He next composed the Phocæid,27 as the Phocæans say. <note type="footnote"> 25 The Little Ilias ('<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιλιὰς μικϱά</foreign>) is generally considered to be the com­ <lb/>
            position of Lesches or Lescheos, who flourished about the eighteenth <lb/>
            Olympiad. This poem, and the Æthiopis of Aretinus, a more ancient <lb/>
            writer, who lived in the beginning of the Olympiads, treated of the same <lb/>
            subject, and so gave rise to an absurd anachronism, concerning a contest <lb/>
            between the two poets. It has been (like all the cyclic poems) vari­ <lb/>

            na;thon of Laeedæmon, and Diodorus of Erythræ. The poem was divided <lb/>
            into four books, according to Proclus, who preserves an extract. It <lb/>
            narrated the fate of Ajax, the exploits of Odysseus, Neoptolemus, and <lb/>
            Philoctetes, and the final capture and sacking of Troy, (Arist. Poet, <lb/>

            When Thestorides had written down that poem, and the rest <lb/>
            he had received from Homer, lie neglected him, and deter­ <lb/>
            mining to appropriate them to himself, left Phocæa, Homer <lb/>
            thus addressed him:</p>
          <p>" Thestorides, of the many things hidden from man, the <lb/>
            most obscure is the human heart." Thestorides, having sailed <lb/>
            from Phocæa, retired to Chios, where he established a school <lb/>
            of literature, and by his having recited Homer's verses, which <lb/>
            he did, attributing them to himself, he obtained great praise <lb/>
            and much money. As to Homer, he continued in the same <lb/>
            way of life as heretofore, being supported by his verses.</p>
          <p>XVII. Shortly afterwards some merchants of Cbios, having <lb/>
            come to Phocæa, went to the assemblies where Homer recited. <lb/>
            Surprised to hear those verses recited that they had so often <lb/>
            applauded when spoken by Thestorides, they informed Homer <lb/>
            that there was at Chios a teacher of literature, who was much <lb/>
            esteemed for the recitation of the same poems. Homer, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving who it was, prepared for a journey to Chios. Having <lb/>
            gone down to the port, he found no ship that was going to <lb/>
            that island, but met with one about to sail for Erythras,28 <lb/>
            to fetch timber. As that town seemed to be convenient for <lb/>
            passing over into Chios, he accosted the seamen courteously, <lb/>
            entreating them to allow him to accompany them, and, as an <lb/>
            inducement, promised to recite some of his verses to them. <lb/>
            They agreed to this, and on his having entered the vessel, <lb/>
            and seated himself, after extolling their hospitality, he ad­ <lb/>
            dressed these verses to them :</p>

            remained for the rest of the day on board the vessel, but, next <lb/>
            morning, begged the sailors to allow some one of them to con­ <lb/>
            duct him to the town. They granted his request. He de­ <lb/>
            parted, and having come to Erythræ, which is situated in a <lb/>
            naked and rocky country, recited the following verses:</p>
          <p>" Holy Mother Gaia, who dispensest thy riches to mankind, <lb/>
            prodigal in goodness to those whom thou favourest; to those <lb/>
            who offend thee thou apportionest only a rocky and sterile soil."</p>
          <p>On his arrival he made inquiries concerning the navigation <lb/>
            to Chios. A person who had known Homer in Phocæa, re­ <lb/>
            membering him with regard, approached and embraced him. <lb/>
            Homer begged his aid, which he readily gave.</p>
          <p>XIX. Not finding any ship30 in the harbour, they went to <lb/>
            that part of the strand whence the fishermen usually put off, <lb/>
            where they found one about to sail for Chios. The conductor <lb/>
            of Homer entreated them to take him across with them; <lb/>
            but, deaf to his prayers, they continued their preparations for <lb/>
            departure. Homer, on this occurrence, made the following <lb/>
            verses:</p>
          <p>" Mariners, who traverse the seas, continually exposed to <lb/>
            the hard vicissitudes of fortune, and who, to regale the more <lb/>
            luxurious, seek a hardly-earned subsistence on the waves, <lb/>
            honour Zens, the god of hospitality, who reigns over us. His <lb/>
            wrath is dreadful; beware lest it burst on your heads, should <lb/>
            you offend him." <note type="footnote"> 30 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλοι̃ν</foreign> must be understood with <foreign xml:lang="grc">αποστολον</foreign>. Conf. '0 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν δὴ άπό­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>The fishermen, all being ready, at length departed, but be­ <lb/>
            ing driven about by adverse winds, were forced to return. <lb/>
            They found Homer still seated on the strand. Hearing the <lb/>
            noise of their return, he addressed them thus: " The winds <lb/>
            are contrary; receive me on board, and they will change." <lb/>
            The fishermen, regretting their inhospitality, promised not to <lb/>
            desert him, if he would come on board.</p>
          <p>XX. He enters the vessel, they leave the shore, and now <lb/>
            they approach the opposite coast. They begin to fish. Homer <lb/>
            passed the night on the sea-shore, but, at the dawn of day, he <lb/>
            departed. Wandering about, he came to a hamlet called Pi­ <lb/>
            thys,31 where he lay down to rest. During his sleep, the fruit <lb/>
            of a pine-tree fell on him. Some call this fruit by the name of <lb/>
            strobilus, others call them pine-cones.32 The following verses <lb/>
            were made by Homer on this occasion:</p>
          <p>" On the summit of Mount Ida there are pine-trees con­ <lb/>
            tinually agitated by the winds, whose fruit is more agreeable <lb/>
            than that of these. From the bosom of that mountain, iron <lb/>
            shall come, sacred to the god of battles, when it shall be occu­ <lb/>
            pied by the Cebrenians."</p>
          <p>For about this time the Cumæans were building Cebrene, <lb/>
            on the heights of Mount Ida, near the place were the iron­ <lb/>
            mines are.</p>
          <p>XXI. Homer, having set out from Pithys, went towards a <lb/>
            troop of goats, being attracted by their cries. The dogs, <note type="footnote"> 31 Pithys signifies a cone. The island was probably very woody, as <lb/>
            Salamis, celebrated for its woods, bore that name in very ancient times. </note><note type="footnote"> 32 Galen (De Alimentorum facultate, tom. iT. p. 325) says, " The cone, <lb/>

            but not easy of digestion. The Greeks of the present time do not call <lb/>
            them cones, but strobili." The occurrence of the word strobilus upsets, <lb/>
            in Wesseling's opinion, the probability of this having been a work of so <lb/>
            early an age as Herodotus. May not, as Larcher plausibly conjectures, <lb/>
            a word have been drawn into the text, through the ignorance of copyists, <lb/>

            seeing In in approach, began to bark at and annoy him. <lb/>
            Glaucus, for that was the name of the shepherd, hearing his <lb/>
            cries, ran hastily, calling his dogs back, and menacing them.33 <lb/>
            This man, surprised to see a blind person alone, and not know­ <lb/>
            in,, how he came there, was rendered speechless from aston­ <lb/>
            ishment. Having accosted him, he asked him how he came <lb/>
            to an uninhabited place, where there were no paths, or who <lb/>
            had guided him thither. Homer related his misfortunes to <lb/>
            him. Glaucus had a tender heart, and was touched by the <lb/>
            narration. He guided Homer to his own house, lighted a <lb/>
            fire, prepared a repast, and setting it before him, pressed him <lb/>
            to eat.</p>
          <p>XXII. The dogs, instead of eating, continued to bark at <lb/>
            Homer, as dogs usually do at strangers. Homer, observing <lb/>
            it, recited these verses :</p>
          <p>" Glaucus, keeper of these flocks,34 understand thoroughly <lb/>
            what I shall say. Give your dogs their food in the porch. <lb/>
            This advice is good. They will then hear the steps of men or <lb/>
            beasts going towards your enclosures more easily."</p>
          <p>Glaucus, finding the advice good on trial, praised the giver <lb/>
            of it more than ever. When they had eaten, animated con­ <lb/>
            versation followed. Homer narrated his adventures in the <lb/>
            various countries and cities he had seen. Glaueus was de­ <lb/>
            lighted, but as it was time to sleep, they went to rest.</p>
          <p>XXIII. The following morning, Glaucus thought it neces­ <lb/>

            had made. Confiding the flocks to the care of his fellow slave, <note type="footnote"> <lb/>

              and leaving Homer in the house, assuring him that he would <lb/>
              not fail to return quickly, he departed. Arrived at Bolissus,35 <lb/>
              a small town, at a little distance from the farm, he related to <lb/>
              his master all that he knew of Homer, speaking of his arrival <lb/>
              as an astonishing thing, and demanding to know his wishes on <lb/>
              the subject. His master did not like the occurrence, and <lb/>
              blamed Glaucus for his foolishness, in admitting a blind man to <lb/>
              his table. Nevertheless, he ordered Homer to be brought to him.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Glaucus, on his return, related to Homer all the <lb/>
            particulars of his visit, and begged him to follow him thither, <lb/>
            telling him that all his future happiness and good fortune de­ <lb/>
            pended on his going to Bolissus. Homer acquiesced in what <lb/>
            he said. Glaucus presented him to his master, who found <lb/>
            him to be a man of information and talent, and offered to re­ <lb/>
            tain him in his house if he would instruct his children, who <lb/>
            were yet very young.36 Homer accepted these proposals. It <lb/>
            was at Bolissus, in the house of this Chian citizen, that he <lb/>
            composed the Cercopia,37 the Batrachomyomachia,38 the Epici- <note type="footnote"> 25 Bolissus, now called Voliso, is a small town on the north-eastern <lb/>

            have gained him such celebrity. When Thestorides heard <lb/>

          <p>XXV. Some time after, Homer begged the Chian citizen <lb/>
            to take him to the town of Chios : he there established a <lb/>
            school,40 in which he taught the maxims of poetry to young <lb/>
            people. He acquitted himself of this task so efficiently, in the <lb/>
            opinion of the Chians, that the greater part held him in high <lb/>
            estimation. He thus acquired a considerable fortune, mar­ <note type="footnote"> counts. The Margites was a comic poem, the subject of which was the <lb/>
            adventures and actions of one whose character is, in the fragments, sum­ <lb/>
            med up thus, " For much he knew, but little knew he well," and that <lb/>
            little he displays with the greatest self-glorification in the world. The <lb/>
            poem was believed by Plato (Alcib. ii. p. 147, c.) and Aristotle (Ethic. <lb/>
            Nicom. vi. 7, Magn. Moral, ad Eudem. v. 7) to be a Homeric production, <lb/>
            was highly esteemed by Callimachus, and in the time of Demosthenes, the <lb/>
            name of Margites was proverbial for stupidity (Harpocr. s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μαϱγίτης</foreign>; <lb/>

            essence of comedy, as the Iliad and Odyssea were of heroic and narrative <lb/>
            poetry. Poetic. § 7. Lindemann, in his work De Lyra, (i. p. 79, &amp;c.,) <lb/>

            (Travels, vol. i. p. 61): " The most curious remain which has been <lb/>

            distance from the city northward, and appears to have been an open tem­ <lb/>

            centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an arm wanting. She is <lb/>

            praise, where he speaks of that city in the most flattering <lb/>
            manner. It occurs in the Catalogue of the Ships :49</p>
          <p>" The city of generous Erechtheus, which the fruitful Earth <lb/>
            produced, and Athenê, daughter of Zeus, fostered." 50</p>
          <p>He then highly extols Menestheus. He excels, says he, in <lb/>
            arranging the chariots and infantry in order of battle. Here <lb/>
            are the lines :</p>
          <p>" The son of Peteus, Menestheus, led these troops. Of all <lb/>
            the mortals fed by Earth, none equalled this chief in the art <lb/>
            of ordering the chariots and forces for battle."51</p>
          <p>He placed Alas, son of Telamon, near the Athenians ; he <lb/>
            commanded the Salaminians. That is in the following verses :</p>
          <p>" Aias, son of Telamon, conducted twelve long ships52 <lb/>
            from Salamis, and placed them beside the Athenian squad­ <lb/>
            ron."53</p>
          <p>Lastly, in the Odyssey, he feigns that Athenê, after an <lb/>
            interview with Odysseus, goes to Athens, the town she hon­ <lb/>

          <p>XXIX. After inserting these lines in his poems, Homer <lb/>
            prepared to set out for Greece, and passed over to Samos on <lb/>
            his way thither. The Samians were employed on his arrival <lb/>
            in celebrating the Apaturian games. An inhabitant of Sa­ <lb/>
            mos, who had seen him in Chios, observing him descending <lb/>
            from the vessel, ran to inform his countrymen of the arrival of <lb/>
            the poet, whom he praised most enthusiastically. The Sa­ <lb/>
            mians deputed him to fetch Homer. He immediately retraced <lb/>
            his steps, and meeting Homer, thus addressed him: " Chian <lb/>
            host, the Samians celebrate the Apaturian festival: the citi­ <lb/>
            zens bid you to the feast." Homer consented, and accom­ <lb/>
            panied the messenger.</p>
          <p>XXX. During their walk, they encountered some women <lb/>
            offering a sacrifice to Kourotrophos.55 The priestess observ­ <lb/>
            ing him, said angrily to him, " Man, get thee from our sacri­ <lb/>
            fices." Homer reflected awhile on these words, having asked <lb/>
            of his conductor who had addressed them to him, and to what <lb/>
            deity they sacrificed. The Samian replied, " that it was a <lb/>
            woman sacrificing to Kourotrophos." On this, Homer com­ <lb/>
            posed and repeated the following lines :</p>
          <p>" Hear my prayer, O Kourotrophos! May that woman <lb/>
            abhor the caresses of amiable youth ! May she be only pleased <lb/>
            by those of men whose hair is white with age, whose heart is <lb/>
            burning, and whose senses are blunted." 56</p>
          <p>XXXI. When arrived at the place where the Phratrium <lb/>
            feasted, Homer paused on the threshold, and recited these <lb/>
            verses to his conductor, while a fire was kindling in the hall: <note type="footnote"> " Odys. vii. 81. </note><note type="footnote"> 55 Kourotrophos is, with some probability, supposed to be identical <lb/>

            are a noble spectacle; but the most pleasant sight, in my <lb/>
            opinion, is that of a burning fire, on a day when the son of <lb/>
            Saturn decks the ground with snow and frost."</p>
          <p>He entered, and seating himself with the Phratrium, re­ <lb/>
            ceived much attention and respect from its members. Here <lb/>
            he passed the night.</p>
          <p>XXXII. The next day he went out. Some potters having <lb/>
            observed him while they were mending their fire, invited him <lb/>
            to enter, and not the less readily from having a knowledge of <lb/>
            his talents. They entreated him to sing some of his verses, <lb/>
            promising to recompense him for his kindness by presenting <lb/>
            him with some of their vases, or in any other way they could. <lb/>
            Homer sung them those verses which are called " The Poem <lb/>
            of the Furnace :58</p>

            did not stop at the town, but at some distance off, on the sea- <lb/>
            shore. Homer, feeling himself very ill, was carried on shore. <lb/>
            Contrary winds retarding the departure of the vessel, the tra­ <lb/>
            vellers remained several days at anchor. Some of the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants visited Homer, and they no sooner heard him speak than <lb/>
            they felt a great degree of veneration for him.</p>
          <p>XXXV. While the sailors and the townspeople were speak­ <lb/>
            ing with Homer, some fishermen's children ran their vessel <lb/>
            on shore, and descending to the sands, addressed these words <lb/>
            to the assembled persons : " Hear us, strangers, explain our <lb/>
            riddle if ye can." Then some of those that were present <lb/>
            ordered them to speak. " We leave," say they, " what we take, <lb/>
            and we carry with us that which we cannot take." No one <lb/>
            being able to solve the enigma, they thus expounded it. <lb/>
            " Having had an unproductive fishery," say they in explana­ <lb/>
            tion, "we sat down on the sand, and being annoyed by the <lb/>
            vermin, left the fish we had taken on the shore, taking with <lb/>
            us the vermin we could not catch." 69 Homer, on hearing this, <lb/>
            made these verses: " Children, your fathers possess neither <lb/>
            ample heritages, nor numerous flocks."</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Homer died in Ios of the disease he had con­ <lb/>
            tracted on his arrival, and not, as some authors have related, <lb/>
            [caring more for interest than truth,] of grief at not under­ <lb/>
            standing the enigma of the fisher-boys.70 He was buried <note type="footnote"> 60 The enigma is founded on the distinction made by the ancients <lb/>
            between having and possessing, which Plato (Theætet. § 126) causes <lb/>
            Socrates to define. "To possess, therefore, does not appear to me to be <lb/>
            the same as to have; for instance, if any one, having bought a garment, <lb/>
            and having it in his power, should not wear it, we should not say that he <lb/>
            has it, but that he possesses it." Cary's trans, vol. i. p. 348, Bohn's Classi­ <lb/>

            have it very oft that have it not," where the word is used in two different <lb/>
            tenses. Somewhat akin to it is the riddle alluded to by Plato, Rep. v. <lb/>
            a. 22. Lactantius has translated this Homeric enigma into Latin, Sympo­ <lb/>

          <p>XXXVII. It may be seen from what I have said, that <lb/>
            Homer was neither a Dorian, nor of the island of los, but an <lb/>
            Æolian.72 This may also be conjectured from the great poet <lb/>
            only speaking of [what he thinks] the most admirable customs, <lb/>
            and he would naturally suppose those of his own country to <lb/>
            be the best.73 It may be judged from these verses :</p>
          <p>" They raise the heads of the oxen toward heaven, cut their <lb/>
            throats, and sever them in pieces; they separate the thighs, <lb/>
            and place over them a double layer of fat, and bleeding morsels <lb/>
            from every part of the victim.74 The kidneys are not men­ <note type="footnote"> " He was warned by an oracle to beware of the young men's riddle. The <lb/>
            meaning of this remained long unexplained to him, till he arrived at the <lb/>
            island of Ios; there, as he sat conversing with the fishermen, some of <lb/>
            them proposed a riddle in verse to him, and, not comprehending it, he <lb/>
            died of grief." Pope, in his Introductory Essay, says, " The story refutes <lb/>
            itself, by carrying superstition at one end, and folly at the other. It <lb/>
            seems conceived with an air of derision, to lay a great man in the dust after <lb/>
            a foolish manner." This completely sets the question of the authenticity <lb/>
            of this Life at rest, since the writer plainly refers to this idle tale, recorded <lb/>
            by an author of so much later date. </note><note type="footnote"> 71 The translation of Grotius is as follows: <lb/>

          <p>XXXVIII. I have now concluded that which concerns the <lb/>
            birth, life, and death of Homer. It remains for me to deter­ <lb/>
            mine the time at which he lived. This is most easily done in the <lb/>
            following manner. The island of Lesbos was not colonized76 <lb/>
            till the hundred and thirtieth year after the Trojan war, and <lb/>
            eighteen years subsequently Smyrna was built by the Cumæ­ <lb/>
            ans. At this time llomer was born.77 From the birth of'the <lb/>
            poet to the passage of Xerxes into Greece, six hundred and <lb/>
            twenty-two years elapsed. The course of time may easily <lb/>
            be calculated by a reference to the Archonships. It is thus <lb/>
            proved that Homer was born one hundred and sixty-eight <lb/>
            years after the taking of Troy. <note type="footnote"> bled the Roman, of which they formed the basis. The thighs and small <lb/>

          <p>In an assembly of the gods it is determined that Ulysses shall be sent to <lb/>
            Ithaea, from the island of Calypso. Minerva then goes to Ithaca to Tele­ <lb/>
            machus, assuming the figure of Mentes, king of the Taphians, an old <lb/>
            friend of Ulysses. Entering into conversation with Telemachus, she ad­ <lb/>
            vises him to go to Pylos, to Nestor, and to Menelaus, at Sparta, to make <lb/>
            inquiries about his father, whether he is still alive; after which she de­ <lb/>
            parts, giving manifest proofs of her divinity. Telemachus rebukes his <lb/>
            mother Penelope, and desires her to go up-stairs: and then, during a <lb/>
            banquet, threatens the suitors that he will be revenged on them for their <lb/>
            insolent conduct.</p>

            although3 seeking to preserve4 his own life, and the return of <lb/>

          <p>Now all the others,8 as many as had escaped from utter <lb/>
            destruction, were at home, having escaped both the war and <lb/>
            the sea. But him alone, anxious for a return [home], and for <lb/>
            his wife, the venerable nymph Calypso, a divine one of the <lb/>
            goddesses, detained in her hollow grot, desiring him to be <lb/>
            her husband. But when, after revolving years,9 the time had <lb/>
            now arrived, in which the gods destined him to return home to <lb/>
            Ithaca, not even then was he freed from labours, although <lb/>
            amongst his own friends. But all the gods pitied him except <lb/>
            Neptune ; but he was unceasingly angry with godlike Ulysses, <lb/>
            before he arrived in his own land. But he [Neptune] had gone <lb/>
            to the Æthiopians who dwell afar off, (the Æthiopians who <lb/>
            are divided into two parts, the most distant of men, some at <lb/>
            the setting of the sun, others at the rising,) in order to obtain 10 <lb/>
            a hecatomb of bulls and lambs. There sitting down he was <lb/>
            delighted with a feast; but the other [gods] were assembled <lb/>
            together in the palace of Olympian Jove. And unto them the <lb/>
            father of men and of gods began discourse; for he remem­ <lb/>
            bered in his mind the noble AEgisthus, whom far-famed <lb/>
            Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, slew : and remembering him, <lb/>
            he spoke [these] words to the immortals.</p>
          <p>"Alas!11 How, forsooth, do mortals reproach the gods! <lb/>

            what is destined. Thus even now AEgisthus, contrary to the <lb/>
            degrees of fate, married the wedded wife of Atrides, and slew <lb/>
            him on his return, although aware that utter destruction <lb/>

          <p>The blue-eyed13 goddess Minerva then answered him: <lb/>
            " O father mine, thou son of Saturn, highest of kings, of a <lb/>
            truth he has perished by a fitting destruction ; so too may <lb/>
            another perish who perpetrates such deeds. But my heart <lb/>
            burns 14 for the prudent 15 ill-fated Ulysses, who, away from his <lb/>
            friends for a long time, is suffering calamities in a sea-girt <lb/>
            island, where is the centre16 of the sea, a woody island: and <lb/>
            in her mansion a goddess dwells, the daughter of all-wise <lb/>
            Atlas, who kens the depths of the whole sea, and holds up the <lb/>
            lofty columns which separate the earth and the heaven ; but <lb/>
            his daughter detains [Ulysses] unhappy, lamenting : and she <lb/>
            continually soothes him with soft and winning words, that he <lb/>
            may forget Ithaca. But Ulysses, longing to behold even the <lb/>
            smoke leaping up from his own land, desires to die. Nor does <lb/>
            thy heart, O Olympian [Jove], at all turn towards him. Did <lb/>
            not then Ulysses gratify thee, performing sacrifices in spacious <lb/>
            Troy near the ships of the Argives ? Why then, O Jove, art <lb/>
            thou so angry with him?"</p>
          <p>But her the cloud-compelling Jove in answer addressed: <lb/>
            " My child, what word has escaped thy lips ?17 How could I <lb/>
            forget divine Ulysses, who excels amongst mortals in under­ <lb/>
            standing, and has abundantly given sacrifice to the immortal <lb/>
            gods, who possess the wide heaven ? But earth-possessing <lb/>
            Neptune is for ever immovably angry on account of the Cy­ <lb/>

            whose power is greatest amongst all the Cyclops: him the <lb/>

            On this account, then, does earth-shaking Neptune not kill <lb/>
            Ulysses, but causes him to wander from his native land. <lb/>
            But come, let all of us contrive his return, in what way he <lb/>
            may come, and Neptune remit his anger; for he will not in­ <lb/>
            deed be able against the will of all the immortal gods, to con­ <lb/>
            tend alone against all.</p>
          <p>Then the blue-eyed goddess Minerva answered him : " O <lb/>
            father mine, thou son of Saturn, highest of kings, if indeed <lb/>
            then this is grateful to the blessed gods that prudent Ulysses <lb/>
            should return home, let us immediately despatch the mes­ <lb/>
            senger19 Mercury, the slayer of Argus, to the island Ogygia, <lb/>
            that he may with all haste declare to the fair-haired nymph <lb/>
            our unerring counsel, the return of patient Ulysses, that he <lb/>
            may return home. But I will go to Ithaca, that I may rouse <lb/>
            his son more, and give strength to his mind, calling the long- <lb/>
            haired Grecians to an assembly, to forbid all the suitors, who <lb/>
            are continually killing his tender sheep, and curved-footed, <lb/>
            crooked-horned oxen. And I will send him to Sparta and to <lb/>
            sandy Pylos, to inquire for the return of his dear father, if <lb/>
            he can any where hear of him, and that a good reputation <lb/>
            amongst men may fall to his lot."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, she bound under her feet her sandals, <lb/>
            beautiful, ambrosial,20 golden, which bore her both over the <lb/>
            moist wave, and over the boundless earth, equally with21 the <lb/>
            gales of the wind. And she took a doughty spear, tipped <lb/>
            with sharp brass, heavy, large, thick, with which she subdues <lb/>
            the ranks of heroes, against whom she, born of a brave sire, is <lb/>
            wrath. And she went darting down from the summit of Olym­ <lb/>
            pus, and stood amongst the people of Ithaca, at the portico of <lb/>
            Ulysses, at the threshold of the hall ; and in her hand site held <lb/>
            a brazen spear, likened to a stranger Mentes, the governor of <lb/>
            the Taphians. There she found the haughty suitors ; some <lb/>
            then were delighting their mind before the gates with drafts,22 <note type="footnote"> 19 The most natural derivation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάκτορος</foreign> is from <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάγω</foreign>, " transveho," <lb/>

            sitting upon hides of oxen, which they themselves had slain. <lb/>
            There with them were heralds and busy servants ; some mixed <lb/>
            wine and water in the cups, but others cleansed the tables with <lb/>
            much-perforated sponges, and set them out, and cut up much <lb/>
            meat. Her did godlike Telemachus see much the first, for <lb/>
            he sat among the suitors sorrowing in his heart, eyeing23 in <lb/>
            his mind his excellent father, if coming from any where he <lb/>
            should make a scattering of the suitors in the house, and <lb/>
            should obtain honour himself and rule over his halls. Medi­ <lb/>
            tating on these things, whilst sitting amongst the suitors, he <lb/>
            beheld Minerva. He then went straight to the portico, and was <lb/>
            indignant in mind that a stranger should stand at the gates <lb/>
            for a long time. And standing near her, he took hold of her <lb/>
            right hand, and received her brazen spear; and addressing <lb/>
            her, [thus] spoke winged words.</p>
          <p>" Welcome, stranger; thou shalt be kindly received by us, <lb/>
            but after thou hast obtained thy supper, thou shalt then relate <lb/>
            what it behoves thee."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he led the way, and Pallas Minerva <lb/>
            followed. And when they were within the lofty house, he took <lb/>
            her spear, and placed it against a tall column within the <lb/>
            well-polished armoury, where also stood many other spears of <lb/>
            patient Ulysses : and leading her he seated her on a beauteous, <lb/>
            variegated throne, spreading a cloth 24 under her ; and there <lb/>
            was a footstool beneath her feet. And he himself placed near <lb/>
            her a variously-worked seat, apart from the other 25 suitors, for <lb/>
            fear the stranger, being troubled with the clamour, should be <lb/>

            golden ewer, over a silver bowl, to wash in; and near them <lb/>
            spread a polished table. And the venerable housekeeper <lb/>
            brought bread and set it near them, laying down many dain­ <lb/>
            ties,27 gratifying them as well as she could out of the pro­ <lb/>
            visions that were at hand. And the cook taking dishes of <lb/>
            all kinds of meat, placed them near, and by their side set <lb/>
            golden cups. And the herald went about continually pouring <lb/>
            out wine for them. And the haughty suitors entered; they <lb/>
            then sat down in order amongst the couches and thrones: and <lb/>
            the heralds poured water on their hands ; [and they distributed <lb/>
            to all beginning with the cups.]23 And the handmaidens <lb/>
            heaped up bread in the baskets ; but they stretched forth their <lb/>
            hands to the viands lying ready before them, and the boys <lb/>
            crowned the goblets with liquor. But when the suitors had <lb/>
            taken away the desire of eating and drinking, other things <lb/>
            were a care to their minds, the song and the dance; for <lb/>
            these are the ornaments of a banquet. Then the herald <lb/>
            placed a beautiful harp in the hands of Phemius, who sung <lb/>
            among the suitors by constraint. He then, playing on the <lb/>

            tell me this truly, that I may be well informed ; whether art <lb/>
            thou just now arrived, or art thou a guest of my father's ? since <lb/>

          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva addressed in turn : <lb/>
            " I will tell thee then, indeed, these things very accurately ; <lb/>
            I say that I ain3l Mentes, the son of the warlike Anchialus, <lb/>
            and I rule over the oar-loving Taphians. And I am now <lb/>
            come hither with my ship and my companions, sailing over <lb/>
            the dark sea to men of a different language, to Temese, for <lb/>
            brass ; and I [also] bring shining steel. But my ship is <lb/>
            stationed off the country at a distance from the city, in the <lb/>
            port Reithrus, under woody Nous. But we say that we are <lb/>
            guests of one another's fathers from the first, if thou shouldest <lb/>
            go and inquire of the old hero Laertes; whom they say no <lb/>

            But now I am come; for they for a long time said that thy <lb/>
            father is returned ; but now the gods hinder him on his jour­ <lb/>

            still detained alive some where on the wide ocean, in a sea-girt <lb/>
            island ; and cruel men are detaining him, savage, who keep him <lb/>
            away some where against his will. But now, indeed, I will <lb/>

            has he [seen] me."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " I will <lb/>
            inform thee, O stranger, very accurately; my mother, indeed, <lb/>
            says that I am his, but I know not; for no one ever knew his <lb/>

            upon whom old age had come [when] in the enjoyment of his <lb/>
            possessions ; but now they say that I was born from him, who is <lb/>
            the most ill-fated of mortal men ; since thou askeat tins of me."</p>
          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva again addressed : <lb/>
            " The gods indeed have not ordained thy race to be ignoble <lb/>

          <p>But with a conflict of painful feelings, Pallas Minerva spoke: <lb/>
            " Alas ! very much indeed dost thou stand in need of the ab­ <lb/>
            sent Ulysses, who might lay his hands on the shameless suitors. <lb/>
            For if he should now come and stand at the outward gate of <lb/>
            the palace, having a helmet and shield and two darts, being such <lb/>
            as when first I beheld him in our house drinking and de­ <lb/>
            lighting himself, having come from Ephyre from Ilus the son <lb/>
            of Mermerus, (for Ulysses went there also in a swift ship, to <lb/>
            seek for a deadly drug, that he might anoint his brazen-tipt <lb/>
            arrows; but bell gave it not to him, for he revered39 the im­ <lb/>
            mortal gods; but my father gave it him, for he loved him <lb/>
            exceedingly,) if being such a one Ulysses should come in <lb/>
            contact with the suitors, all would be quick-fated, and would <lb/>
            have a bitter marriage. But all these things lie on the knees <lb/>
            of the gods; whether he returning shall exact vengeance in <lb/>
            his own palace, or not. But I exhort thee to consider by what <lb/>
            means thou mayest thrust out the suitors from the palace. <lb/>

            to disperse to their own homes. And if thy mother's mind <lb/>

            ought to accompany a dear child. But to thee I will suggest <lb/>
            prudently, if thou wilt obey me. Having prepared a ship, <lb/>
            whichsoever is the Lest, with twenty rowers, go and inquire <lb/>
            about thy father long absent, if any one of mortals can tell <lb/>
            thee of him, or thou shouldest hear a report41 from Jove, <lb/>
            which especially brings notice to mortals. First then come <lb/>
            to Pylos and inquire of divine Nestor; thence to Sparta to <lb/>
            auburn-haired Menelaus ; for he came last of the Greeks who <lb/>
            wear brazen breastplates. If thou shouldest hear that thy <lb/>
            father is alive and will return,42 then, although afflicted, thou <lb/>
            mayest yet endure it for a year: but if thou shouldest hear <lb/>
            that he is dead, and no longer exists, then returning to thy <lb/>
            dear paternal land, erect aloft a monument for him, and per­ <lb/>
            form very many funeral rites, whatsoever are becoming; <lb/>
            and bestow upon thy mother a husband. But when thou <lb/>
            shalt have concluded and done these things, then consider in <lb/>
            thy breast and in thy mind, how thou mayest kill the suitors in <lb/>
            thy palace, either by stratagem or openly. Nor oughtest thou <lb/>
            by any means to follow childish pursuits, since thou art no <lb/>
            longer of such an age. Dost thou not hear what glory the divine <lb/>
            Orestes has obtained amongst all men, since he slew the crafty <lb/>
            murderer Ægisthus, who slew his renowned father? And do <lb/>
            thou, my friend, (for I see that thou art honourable and great,) <lb/>
            be brave, that some one of posterity may speak well of thee <lb/>
            also. But I will now go to my swift ship, and to my com­ <lb/>
            panions, who are in very low spirits through waiting for me. <lb/>
            But be this thy care, and do thou regard my words."</p>
          <p>But her the prudent Telemachus answered in turn : <lb/>
            "Stranger, surely thou givest me this advice, being friendly <lb/>
            disposed towards me, as a father to his son, and I will never <lb/>
            forget it. But come, tarry now, although hastening on thy <lb/>

          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva forthwith answer­ <lb/>
            ed : " Do not any longer detain me, since I am anxious for my <lb/>
            journey; but as to the present, whatever thy heart urges thee <lb/>
            to give me, give it when I return again, that I may take it <lb/>
            home, [yourself] having received a very beauteous [gift]; for <lb/>
            it shall be a worthy recompence for thee.43</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, blue-eyed Minerva departed, and <lb/>
            flew aloft44 like a bird ; but she placed strength and courage <lb/>
            in his feelings, and put him still more in mind of his father <lb/>
            than before: but he, considering within his breast, was aston­ <lb/>
            ished on reflection, for he thought that she was a god. Then <lb/>
            the godlike man immediately went amongst the suitors; and <lb/>
            the illustrious bard was singing to them, but they sat listening <lb/>
            in silence ; [for] he was singing the sad return of the Grecians, <lb/>
            which Pallas Minerva ordained from Troy. His divine song <lb/>
            prudent Penelope, the daughter of Icarus, understood in her <lb/>
            mind from the upper chamber; 45 and she came down the <lb/>
            lofty stairs of her palace, not alone, for two female attendants <lb/>
            followed with her. But when she, divine amongst women, <lb/>
            came to the suitors, she stood near the threshold of the stout- <lb/>
            built hall, holding up a slender veil before her cheeks ; and a <lb/>
            modest female attendant stood on either side of her, and weep­ <lb/>
            ing she then addressed the divine bard.</p>
          <p>" O Phemius, since thou dost ken many other things to <lb/>
            cheer mortals, the deeds of men and of gods, which bards are <lb/>
            wont to celebrate; do thou sit down then, and sing one of <lb/>
            these, and let them drink their wine in silence: but cease <lb/>
            from this sad strain, which for ever wears my46 heart within <lb/>

          <p>Her prudent Telemachus addressed in turn : " My mother, <lb/>
            why dost thou grudge the agreeable bard to delight in <lb/>
            what way his mind incites him; the bards are not the cause, <lb/>
            but Jove is sometimes the cause, who suggests to ingenious <lb/>
            men, as he chooses to each. There is no blame for him <lb/>
            to sing the evil fate of the Grecians. For men celebrate <lb/>
            that song most, which is newest to the hearers. But let <lb/>
            thy heart and mind endure to hear it. For Ulysses was <lb/>
            not the only one who, at Troy, lost his return; but many <lb/>
            other men likewise perished. Go then into thy chamber,48 <lb/>
            and attend to thine own employments, the web and the dis­ <lb/>
            tant, and bid thy servants hasten their work ; but conversation <lb/>
            shall be a care to all men, and especially to me; for the <lb/>
            authority within the house is mine." She indeed astonished <lb/>
            went again within the house; for she revolved in her mind <lb/>
            the prudent words of her son. And going to the upper room <lb/>
            with her women attendants, she then wept for her dear <lb/>
            husband Ulysses, until blue-eyed Minerva shed sweet sleep <lb/>
            over her eyelids. But the suitors were rioting within the <lb/>
            shaded dwellings, and all longed to recline Oil a couch <lb/>
            with her.</p>
          <p>But prudent Telemachus began to address them : " Suitors <lb/>
            of my mother, who are possessed of overbearing insolence, <lb/>
            now let us delight ourselves feasting, nor let there be any <lb/>
            clamour ; since this is an honourable thing, to hear such a <lb/>
            bard as he is, like unto the gods in his voice. But in the <lb/>
            morning let us all go and sit down in assembly, that I may <lb/>
            confidently declare this message to you, that you are to go out <lb/>
            of this dwelling; and prepare other feasts, consuming your <lb/>
            own possessions, taking turns at each other's houses. But if <lb/>
            this seems to you more proper and better, to destroy with <lb/>
            impunity the livelihood of one man, waste it; but49 I will call <lb/>

            shall meet with retribution, then shall ye perish unrevenged <lb/>
            within the house."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but they all biting their lips marvelled at <lb/>
            Telemachus, that he harangued so boldly. <note type="footnote"> 50 <foreign xml:lang="grc">οίκον</foreign> =<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερψ̃α</foreign> in vs. 362. </note><note type="footnote">49 i. e. then I will. </note><note type="footnote"> 51 Literally, " weeping close their lips on the teeth " </note> <pb n="13"/>

          <p>But him Antinous, the son of Eupnhes, addressed in <lb/>
            answer: "0 Telemachus, of a truth the gods themselves <lb/>
            teach thee to be a lofty speaker, and to harangue boldly ; but <lb/>
            never may the son of Saturn make thee king in sea-girt Ithaci, <lb/>
            which is hereditary to thee by descent."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn: "An­ <lb/>
            tinous, art thou amazed at what I say ? Indeed I should <lb/>
            wish to receive this, if Jove would grant it. Dost thou say <lb/>
            that this is the worst thing amongst men? For it is by no <lb/>
            means a bad thing to be a king ; his house forthwith becomes <lb/>
            opulent, and he himself more honoured. But indeed there are <lb/>
            many other kings of the Grecians in sea-girt Ithaca, young <lb/>
            and old ; some one of these may possess this, since divine <lb/>
            Ulysses is dead. But I will be king over mine own house, <lb/>
            and my servants, whom divine Ulysses has obtained for me <lb/>
            as his share of booty."</p>
          <p>But him Eurymachus, son of Polybus, then answered : <lb/>
            " Telemachus, these things of a certainty lie on the knees of <lb/>
            the gods, [ as to] who of the Grecians shall reign in sea-girt <lb/>
            Ithaca; but thou mayest thyself have his possessions, and <lb/>
            rule over his house. For never may the man come, who would <lb/>
            waste thy possessions by force against thy will, when Ithaca <lb/>
            is still inhabited. But I wish to inquire of thee, O most ex­ <lb/>
            cellent one, about the stranger, from whence this man is, and <lb/>
            from what land he boasts himself to be ; and where are his <lb/>
            race,51 and his paternal fields.52 Does he bring any news of thy <lb/>
            father's coming, or desiring some debt of his own, does he <lb/>
            come hither? For he went away immediately in haste, nor <lb/>
            did he wait for us to know him ; yet in countenance he was by <lb/>
            no means like a mean person."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus addressed in answer: " Eury­ <lb/>
            machus, truly the return of my father has perished ; nor do I <lb/>
            any longer give credit to any message, if one should come <lb/>
            from any place: nor do I regard an oracle, if my mother, <lb/>
            having called any prophet to the palace, should inquire of <lb/>
            him. But this man is a guest of my father's from Taphos ; he <lb/>
            boasts himself to be Mentes, son of warlike Anchialus, but he <lb/>
            reigns over the oar-loving Taphians."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Telemachus ; but in his mind he knew the im- <note type="footnote"> 51 " Uncle natus sit." Loewe. </note><note type="footnote"> 52 <foreign xml:lang="grc">γη̃ ἀρουμένη</foreign>. Eustath, </note> <pb n="14"/>

            mortal goddess. But they having turned to the dance and <lb/>
            the lovely song were delighted ; and awaited till evening <lb/>
            came on. And dark evening came upon them whilst they <lb/>
            were being delighted. They then went each to his home to <lb/>
            sleep; but Telemachus, where the lofty chamber of the most <lb/>
            beautiful palace was built for him, in a conspicuous place, <lb/>
            there went to bed, meditating many things in his mind. <lb/>
            Chaste Euryclea, daughter of Ops, son of Pisenor, carried <lb/>
            lighted torches with him; she whom formerly Laertes had <lb/>
            bought with his wealth, while she was still in the prime of <lb/>
            youth, and he gave a hundred beeves [for her]. And he <lb/>
            honoured her in his palace, equally with his chaste wife; but <lb/>
            he never embraced her on the couch, for he avoided the anger <lb/>
            of his wife. She carried lighted torches with him, and loved <lb/>
            him most of the female servants, and had nurtured him when <lb/>
            little. But he opened the door of the well-made chamber, <lb/>
            and sat on the bed, and put off his soft garment, and placed <lb/>
            it in the hands of the prudent old woman. She having folded <lb/>
            and arranged the garment, and having hung it on a peg near <lb/>
            the eompact53 bed, hastened from the chamber, and drew to <lb/>
            the door with a silver ring, and fastened the bolt with the <lb/>

          <p>Telemachus, having called an assembly, commands the suitors to leave the <lb/>
            house of Ulysses: upon which there arises a sharp dispute, and an omen <lb/>
            appears favourable to Telemachus. He then informs the suitors of his <lb/>
            intention of going in quest of his father, and asks for a ship for that pur­ <lb/>
            pose ; which they refuse : but Minerva, appearing to him again, furnishes <lb/>
            him with a ship and companions, Having obtained provisions from Eu­ <lb/>
            ryclea, he sets sail in the evening in company with Minerva, without hav­ <lb/>
            ing informed his mother of his intended departure.</p>
          <p>BUT when the mother of dawn,' rosy-fingered morning, ap­ <lb/>
            peared, then the dear son of Ulysses arose from his bed, hav­ <lb/>
            ing put on his garments: and around his shoulder he slung <lb/>
            a sharp sword; and beneath his shining feet he bound beauti <lb/>
            ful sandals. And he went forth from his chamber like unto <lb/>
            a god to behold.2 And forthwith he ordered the shrill-voiced <lb/>
            heralds to call to an assembly the long-haired Grecians. They <lb/>
            indeed called them ; and they were very quickly assembled. <lb/>
            But when they were assembled, and were collected together, <lb/>
            he proceeded to go to the forum, and in his hand he held a <lb/>
            brazen spear. Not alone, for two swift3 dogs followed in <lb/>
            company with him ; and over him Minerva shed divine grace. <lb/>
            And all the people gazed at him as he came, and he sat in the <lb/>
            seat of his father, and the old men gave way. Then the hero <lb/>
            Ægyptius began to harangue them, who was bent with old <lb/>
            age, and knew ten thousand things. For his dear son, the <lb/>
            warrior Antiphus, went with godlike Ulysses in the hollow <lb/>
            ships to steed-excelling Ilium. But the fierce Cyclops slew <lb/>
            him in his hollow cave, and prepared for his last4 supper. And <lb/>
            there were three others ; but one of them, Eurynomus, asso­ <lb/>
            ciated with the suitors : but two were always employed in <lb/>
            their paternal duties. But not even thus did he forget him,5 <lb/>
            lamenting and grieving. He pouring forth tears harangued <lb/>
            them and spoke:</p>

            has our assembly, nor our sitting together, taken place, since <lb/>
            divine Ulysses went in the hollow ships. But now who has <lb/>
            assembled us here ? upon whom does so great a necessity <lb/>
            come, whether of young men, or of those who are more ad­ <lb/>
            vanced ? Whether has any one heard some intelligence of an <lb/>
            army coming against us, which indeed he can declare clearly <lb/>
            to us, since he heard it first ? or does he bring forward and <lb/>
            advise something else which is public ? He appears to me to <lb/>
            be a good man, and may he be fortunate.6 May Jove accom­ <lb/>
            plish for him whatever good he is anxious for in his mind."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but the beloved son of Ulysses rejoiced in <lb/>
            the omen ;7 nor did he sit still much longer, but was anxious <lb/>
            to harangue; and he stood in the middle of the assembly ; and <lb/>
            the herald Pisenor, who understood prudent counsels, placed <lb/>
            the sceptre in his hand. First then, turning towards8 the old <lb/>
            man, he spoke [thus] :</p>
          <p>"0 old man, not far off is this9 man who assembled the <lb/>
            people (and thou thyself wilt soon know him) ; but grief <lb/>
            comes especially upon me; I have neither heard any intelli­ <lb/>
            gence of an army coming against us, which indeed I can <lb/>
            clearly declare to thee, since I have heard it first, nor do I <lb/>
            bring forward or advise any thing else which is public. But <lb/>
            my own necessity, the evil which has fallen upon mine house, <lb/>
            which is two-fold. First, I have lost my excellent sire, who <lb/>
            was formerly a king amongst you who are here,10 and he was <lb/>
            mild as a father. But now again even a much greater [evil <lb/>
            has befallen], which will soon altogether break up my whole <lb/>
            house, and will entirely destroy my whole livelihood. Suitors <lb/>
            are urging my mother against her will, the sons of the men <lb/>
            who are the chief here: they dread to go to the house of her <lb/>
            Icarian father, so that he may endow his daughter, and give <lb/>
            her to whom he chooses, and to whomsoever should come ac­ <lb/>
            ceptable to him. But they, spending all their days at my <lb/>
            house, sacrificing oxen, and sheep, and fat goats, feast, and <lb/>
            drink my ruddy 11 wine to no purpose: but many things are <note type="footnote"> ' Supply <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἲη</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀνήμενος</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 i. e. in words that seem to prognosticate his own success. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 In other passages, as vs. 240, this means " to rebuke." </note><note type="footnote"> 9 Telemachus points to himself.

            consumed ; for there is not present such a man as Ulysses <lb/>
            was, to avert the calamity from the house. We are by no <lb/>
            means such [as he was] to resist them ; and besides we should <lb/>
            be both weak, and not skilled in strength. Truly would I <lb/>
            resist them, if strength were mine. For no longer are the <lb/>
            deeds to be endured that have been done, and no longer does <lb/>
            my house perish honourably. Be ye yourselves indignant, <lb/>
            and revere other neighbouring men, who dwell around : and <lb/>
            dread the wrath of the gods, lest they should make some <lb/>
            change, enraged at your evil deeds. I beseech you by Olym­ <lb/>
            pian Jove and by Themis, who both breaks up and seats <lb/>
            the assemblies of men, withhold, my friends, and suffer me to <lb/>
            be afflicted alone with mournful grief, if my father the good <lb/>
            Ulysses, being hostile, has at any time done evil to the well- <lb/>
            greaved Grecians. Taking revenge upon me for these things, <lb/>
            be hostile to me, and do me harm, inciting these. And it <lb/>
            would be better for me that ye should consume my household- <lb/>
            stuff, and my cattle. But if you should devour them, per­ <lb/>
            haps there would be a requital hereafter; for so long should <lb/>
            we make entreaties through the city, demanding back our <lb/>
            goods, until all shall be restored: but now you cast incurable <lb/>
            griefs into my mind."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke enraged, and cast the sceptre on the earth, <lb/>
            bursting into tears ;12 and pity possessed all the people. Here <lb/>
            all the others were silent, nor did any one dare to answer <lb/>
            Telemachus with bitter word? but Antinous alone in answer <lb/>
            addressed him.</p>
          <p>" Telemachus, of lofty speech, intolerable in spirit, what <lb/>
            hast thou said, disgracing us ! Thou wouldst wish in truth to <lb/>
            attach blame [ to us]. The suitors of the Grecians13 are not <lb/>
            at all to blame, but thy mother, who is exceedingly skilled in <lb/>
            craft: for it is now the third year, and the fourth is going on 14 <lb/>
            swiftly, since she deceives the mind of the Grecians in their <lb/>
            breast. She makes all hope, and promises every man, send­ <lb/>
            in,, messages; but her mind hankers after other things. For <lb/>
            she planned this other deceit in her mind; having begun a <note type="footnote"> 12 Literally, " lacrymas incendens." See Buttm. Lexil. p. 484, who <lb/>

            large web in her palace she wove it, slender and very large; <lb/>
            and straightway addressed us: ' Youths, my suitors, since <lb/>
            godlike Ulysses is dead, stay urging my marriage until ] <lb/>
            shall finish this veil, that my threads may not perish in <lb/>
            vain, a shroud for the hero Laertes, at the time when the <lb/>
            destructive fate of long-slumbering death shall seize him. <lb/>
            Lest some one amongst the Grecian women be indignant <lb/>
            against me, should he lie without a wrapper, having pos­ <lb/>
            sessed many things.' Thus she spoke, and our proud mind <lb/>
            was persuaded. Then during the day she wove the mighty <lb/>
            web; but at night, when she had placed the torches near her, <lb/>
            she unravelled it. Thus for three years, indeed, she escaped <lb/>
            by deceit, and persuaded the Grecians. But when the fourth <lb/>
            yearl5 came, and the hours advanced on, then indeed some <lb/>
            one of the women, who knew it well, told it; and we found <lb/>
            her unravelling the splendid web ; so that she finished it of <lb/>
            necessity, although unwilling. Thus the suitors answer thee, <lb/>
            that thou mayest thyself know it in thy mind, and that all <lb/>
            the Greeks may know it. Send away your mother, and bid <lb/>
            her marry whomsoever her father bids, and she herself pleases. <lb/>
            But if she shall for a long time further annoy the sons of the <lb/>
            Grecians, caring in mind for those things, which Minerva has <lb/>
            given her in abundance, to understand beautiful works, and [to <lb/>
            possess] a good disposition, and stratagems, such as we have <lb/>
            never heard anyone, even of the ancients, [possessed, 16] of those, <lb/>
            who have been heretofore fair-haired Grecian women,17 Tyro, <lb/>
            and Alcmene, and fair-haired Mycene; none of these knew <lb/>
            the same arts of Penelope. But this indeed she has not planned <lb/>
            rightly. For then they will consume thy livelihood and posses­ <lb/>
            sions, so long as she has this mind, which the gods have now <lb/>
            placed in her breast; for herself indeed she obtains great glory, <lb/>
            but for thee a regret for much sustinence.18 But we will <lb/>
            neither go to our employments, nor any where else, before she <lb/>
            marries whomsoever of the Grecians she chooses."</p>
          <p>Him prudent Telemachus addressed in turn : " O Antinous, <lb/>

            me; but my father is either alive or dead in some other part <lb/>
            of the earth: but it would be a sad tiling that I should pay20 <lb/>
            much to Icarius, if I should myself of my own accord send <lb/>
            away my mother. For I shall suffer evil from her father,21 <lb/>
            and God will give other [evils], when my mother, de­ <lb/>
            parting from the house, shall invoke the hateful Furies; and <lb/>
            there will be reproach upon me from men. So I never will <lb/>
            utter this word. But if your mind is indignant at these <lb/>
            things, go out of my house, and prepare other feasts, con­ <lb/>
            suming your own possessions, taking turns at each other's <lb/>

            for him two eagles to fly from aloft from the top of a moun­ <lb/>

            when they came to the middle of the noisy assembly, there <lb/>
            turning round they shook their dense pinions, and looked <lb/>
            over the heads of all, and portended23 destruction: for tear­ <lb/>

            rushed on the right hand through their24 houses and city. But <lb/>
            they were astonished at the birds, when they beheld them <lb/>
            with their eyes, and considered in their mind what things <lb/>
            were about to be brought to pass. And the old hero Hali­ <lb/>

            him, as I foretold him, when the Argives embarked for Troy,28 <lb/>
            and crafty Ulysses went with them. I said that he, having <lb/>

            come home unrecognised by all, in the twentieth year. All <lb/>
            these things then are now being brought to pass."</p>

            make a marriage for her, and will prepare a very large dowry, <lb/>
            such as ought to accompany a beloved daughter. For I do <lb/>
            not think that the sons of the Grecians will rest from their <lb/>
            troublesome suit before [this]; since we fear no one at all, <lb/>
            not even Telemachus, although he is a man ot many words. <lb/>
            Nor do we regard the oracle, which thou, old man, speakest <lb/>
            in vain, and thou art still more hated. But his property will <lb/>

          <p>Thus having spoken, he sat down ; but Mentor rose up to <lb/>
            them, who was the companion of illustrious Ulysses, and when <lb/>
            he went in the ships, he committed to him all his family, that <lb/>
            the old man should be obeyed, and should keep all things safe, <lb/>
            who being well disposed harangued and addressed them:</p>

            ways be severe and do unjust36 things; since not one of the <lb/>
            people, over whom he reigned, remembers the divine Ulysses, <lb/>
            and that he was mild as a father.37 But I indeed by no means <lb/>

          <p>Thus he spoke, and he dissolved the assembly quickly.43 <lb/>
            They then were dispersed each to their own homes ; but the <lb/>
            suitors went to the house of godlike Ulysses. But Telema­ <lb/>
            chus going at a distance on the shore of the sea, having washed <lb/>
            his hands in the hoary wave, prayed to Minerva:</p>
          <p>" Hear me, thou deity who didst yesterday come to my <lb/>
            house, and didst command me to go in a ship over the shadowy <lb/>
            sea to inquire concerning the return of my long-absent father ; <lb/>
            but the Grecians waste all these things, and especially the <lb/>
            suitors, who are wickedly haughty."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke praying; but Minerva came near to him, <lb/>
            likened unto Mentor both in person and voice, and addressing <lb/>
            him spoke winged words.</p>
          <p>" Telemachus, thou wilt not be hereafter a coward or fool­ <lb/>
            ish ; if indeed the excellent disposition of thy father has been <lb/>
            instilled into thee, such as he was to perform a deed and a <lb/>
            word, thy journey soon will not be vain or unfinished ; but if <lb/>
            thou art not the son of him and Penelope, I do not expect <lb/>
            that thou wilt perform what thou art eagerly bent upon. For <lb/>
            few sons are like their father ; more are worse; but few are <lb/>
            better than their father. But since thou wilt not hereafter <lb/>
            be a coward or foolish, nor has the understanding of Ulysses <lb/>
            altogether left thee, there is some hope for thee that thou <lb/>
            wilt perform these works. Wherefore disregard now the <lb/>
            counsel and the mind of the foolish suitors, since they are <lb/>
            not prudent or just: nor do they anticipate the death and <lb/>
            gloomy fate, which is now nigh to them, for all to perish in <lb/>
            one day. But the journey for which thou art anxious will <lb/>
            not be long put off. For I, thy father's friend, am such <lb/>
            to thee, wh044 will make ready for thee a swift ship, and <lb/>
            will myself follow. But do thou go to the house, and as­ <lb/>

          <p>Thus spoke Minerva, the daughter of Jove, nor did Te­ <lb/>
            lemachus delay a long time, when he heard the voice of the <lb/>
            goddess. But he hastened to his house, sorrowing in his <lb/>
            heart; and he found the haughty suitors in the palace skin­ <lb/>
            ning goats, and roasting fattened swine45 in the hall. But <lb/>
            Antinous laughing went to meet Telemachus, and took hold of <lb/>
            his hand, and spoke and called him by name:</p>
          <p>" Telemachus, thou lofty speaker, intolerable in spirit, let <lb/>
            not any other evil deed or word be a care to thee in thy breast, <lb/>
            but eat and drink for my sake46 as before. But the Grecians <lb/>
            will thoroughly get ready all these things, a ship and chosen <lb/>
            rowers, that thou mayest more quickly arrive at divine Pylos, <lb/>
            in quest of thine illustrious sire."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " Anti­ <lb/>
            nous, it is not possible for me to feast in quiet47 and to rejoice <lb/>
            peaceably amongst you arrogant48 ones. It is not enough that <lb/>
            hitherto ye suitors have clipped my many and excellent pos­ <lb/>

          <p>And then another one of the haughty youths said: " But <lb/>
            who knows whether he himself going in a hollow ship may <lb/>
            perish far away from his friends, wandering as Ulysses? So <lb/>
            indeed he would still more increase our labour; for we should <lb/>
            divide all his possessions, and moreover give his house to his <lb/>
            mother to posssess, and whoever should marry her."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke; but he went down to the spacious lofty- <lb/>
            roofed store-room of his father, where, heaped up, lay gold <lb/>
            and brass, and garments in chests, and plenty of sweet-smell­ <lb/>
            in,, oil. And there stood casks of old sweet wine, contain­ <lb/>
            ing pure, divine drink, fitted in order against the wall; if <lb/>
            at any time Ulysses should return home, although having <lb/>
            toiled through many griefs. But upon it there were shut <lb/>
            doors closely fitted, double; and within there was night and <lb/>
            day a female housekeeper,53 who watched every thing through <lb/>
            the long experience of her mind, Euryclea, the daughter of <lb/>
            Ops son of Pisenor. Having called her to the store-room, <lb/>
            Telemachus then addressed her:</p>
          <p>" Nurse, come draw me some sweet wine in the casks, which <lb/>
            is the more luscious54 after that, which you are preserving, in <lb/>
            expectation of him, the unfortunate ; if from any where noble <lb/>

            when my mother is gone to her upper chamber, and is think­ <lb/>

            inquire concerning the return of my dear father, if I can any <lb/>

          <p>Thus he spoke; but his dear nurse Euryclea wailed, and <lb/>
            mourning she spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" Why, my dear child, is this thought in thy mind ? whither <lb/>
            dost thou wish to go over much land, being alone beloved ? but <lb/>
            he, Jove-sprung Ulysses, has perished far away from his conn­ <lb/>

            art gone, will hereafter devise evil things, how thou mayest <lb/>
            perish by deceit, and they themselves may divide all these <lb/>
            things. But do thou remain here, sitting amongst thine <lb/>
            own: nor is it at all fit that thou shouldst suffer harm, or <lb/>
            wander over the unfruitful sea."</p>
          <p>To her prudent Telemachus [thus] spoke in turn: " Be <lb/>
            of good cheer, nurse, since this counsel is by no means with­ <lb/>
            out God :56 but swear that thou wilt not tell these things to <lb/>
            my mother, before the eleventh or twelfth day shall arrive, <lb/>
            or she herself should inquire, and hear that I am gone; that <lb/>
            she may not hurt her beauteous form [by] weeping."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but the old woman swore a great oath by <lb/>
            the gods. But when she had sworn and concluded the oath, <lb/>
            site straightway drew wine for him in the casks, and poured <lb/>
            meal into the well-sewn skins. But Telemachus, going into <lb/>
            the house, associated with the suitors.57</p>
          <p>Then again the blue-eyed goddess Minerva thought upon <lb/>
            other things ; and likened unto Telemachus she went every <lb/>
            where through the city, and then standing near each man <lb/>
            spoke the word ; and bade them in the evening be assembled <lb/>
            at the swift ship. She then begged a swift ship of Noemon <lb/>
            the glorious son of Phronius ; and he willingly promised it <lb/>
            to her.</p>
          <p>And the sun set, and all the ways were overshadowed ; and <lb/>

            the tackle in it, which well-benched ships carry. And she <lb/>
            stood at the extremity of the port; and her excellent com­ <lb/>
            panions were collected together around her; and the goddess <lb/>
            incited cach.</p>
          <p>Then the blue-eyed goddess Minerva thought of other <lb/>
            things, and hastened to the dwelling of godlike Ulysses : there <lb/>
            she shed sweet sleep over the suitors, and caused them to <lb/>
            wander while drinking ; and cast the cups out of their hands.58 <lb/>
            And they59 hastened through the city to sleep; nor did they <lb/>
            sit any longer, when sleep fell upon their eye-lids. But <lb/>
            blue-eyed Minerva addressed Telemachus, having called him <lb/>
            forth out of the well-inhabited palace, likened unto Mentor <lb/>
            both in her person and her voice.</p>
          <p>" Telemachus, already are thy well-greaved companions <lb/>
            sitting at their oars, awaiting your approach. Now let us go, <lb/>
            nor delay the voyage any longer."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, Pallas Minerva quickly led the way; <lb/>
            but he straightway followed the steps of the goddess. And <lb/>
            when they came to the ship and to the sea, then they found <lb/>
            their long-haired companions on the shore; and the sacred <lb/>
            might of Telemachus60 addressed them: " Hither, my friends, <lb/>
            let us bring provisions; for all things are now collected in <lb/>
            the dwelling ; and my mother knows it not at all; nor do the <lb/>
            other female servants, but one only has heard the matter."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken he led the way ; and they followed <lb/>
            with him. And bringing all the things, they placed them on <lb/>
            the well-benched ship, as the dear son of Ulysses gave orders. <lb/>
            Telemachus then embarked in the ship, and Minerva led and <lb/>
            sat down in the stern, and near her sat Telemachus. And they <lb/>
            loosed the hawsers; and themselves embarking, sat on the <lb/>
            benches. But to them blue-eyed Minerva sent a favourable <lb/>
            gale,61 a brisk zephyr whistling over the dark sea. But Te­ <lb/>

          <p>On reaching Pylos with Minerva, Telemachus finds the Pylians sacrificing <lb/>
            bulls to Neptune. At the conclusion of the ceremony, Telemachus states <lb/>
            the object of his voyage, and Nestor in reply relates what had happened <lb/>
            to himself, and the circumstances of their sailing from Troy; but having <lb/>
            no tidings of Ulysses, he advises him to go to Menclaus. Minerva de­ <lb/>
            parts, having discovered who she is ; upon which Nestor offers sacrifice to <lb/>
            her; and then sends Telemachus with his son Pisistratus in a chariot to <lb/>
            Sparta. They arrive at Pherme in the evening, and are entertained by <lb/>

            they came to Pylos, the well-built citadel of Neleus: now <lb/>
            they3 were offering sacrifices on the shore of the sea, all-black <lb/>

            having lifted up the sails of the equals ship furled [them], <lb/>
            and moored it; and they themselves disembarked. Telema­ <lb/>
            chus then disembarked from the ship: but Minerva led the <lb/>
            way : the blue-eyed goddess Minerva first addressed him :</p>
          <p>" Telemachus, no longer hast thou need of modesty, not even <lb/>
            a little; for on that account hast thou sailed over the sea, that <lb/>
            thou mayest inquire about thy father, where the earth COIl­ <lb/>
            ceals him, and what fate he has drawn on himself. But <lb/>
            come now, go straight to horse-taming Nestor; let us see7 <lb/>
            what counsel he has concealed in his breast. But beseech <lb/>
            him to tell thee what is true: but he will not speak a false­ <lb/>
            hood ; for he is very prudent."</p>
          <p>Prudent Telemachus then addressed her in turn : " Mentor, <lb/>
            how shall I approach, how shall I salute him ? I am not at <lb/>
            all experienced in prudent discourse; besides there is diffi­ <lb/>
            dence8 for a young man to question an older."</p>
          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva again addressed <lb/>
            " Telemachus, thou wilt thyself perceive some things in thine <lb/>
            own mind, and the deity9 will suggest others: for I do not <lb/>
            think that thou wast born or nourished against the will of the <lb/>
            gods."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, Pallas Minerva quickly led the way. <lb/>
            And he went immediately after the steps of the deity; and <lb/>
            they came to the assembly and seats of the Pylians. There <lb/>
            sat Nestor with his sons; and around were his companions <lb/>
            preparing the feast, roasting flesh, and fixing other things <lb/>
            on spits. They then, when they saw the strangers, all came <lb/>
            together, and in salutation took them by the hand, and <lb/>

            ing out the right hand,10 called upon Pallas Minerva, the <lb/>
            daughter of Ægis-bearing Jove :</p>
          <p>" Pray now, O stranger, to king Neptune; for at his <lb/>
            feast have ye met coming here. But when ye have made <lb/>
            libations and have prayed, as is the custom,11 then to him also <lb/>
            give the cup of sweet wine to make a libation ; since I think <lb/>
            that he also prays to the immortals; for all men have need of <lb/>
            the gods: but he is younger [than thou], and of equal age <lb/>
            with myself:12 therefore I will give the golden cup first to <lb/>
            thee."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he placed the cup of sweet wine in <lb/>
            her hands; and Minerva was pleased on account of the pru­ <lb/>
            dent just man, because he gave the golden cup to her first. <lb/>
            And she straightway prayed much to king Neptune.</p>
          <p>" Hear, thou earth-containing Neptune, nor envy us be­ <lb/>
            seeching thee to accomplish these works. To Nestor first and <lb/>
            to his sons give glory ; but afterwards to others grant a grate­ <lb/>
            ful recompence, to all the Pylians, for their illustrious heca­ <lb/>
            tomb : and grant besides that Telemachus and I may return, <lb/>
            having performed [the things] on account of which we came <lb/>
            hither with a swift black ship."</p>
          <p>Thus then she prayed ; and she herself accomplished all <lb/>
            things, but she gave the beautiful round cup13 to Telemachus. <lb/>
            In the same manner prayed the dear son of Ulysses. And <lb/>
            when they had roasted the upper14 flesh and had taken it off, <lb/>
            having distributed the shares, they made a glorious feast. But <lb/>
            when they had removed the desire of drinking and eating, to <lb/>

          <p>Prudent Telemachus in turn answered him, taking con­ <lb/>
            fidence ; for Minerva herself had infused confidence into his <lb/>
            mind, that he might inquire of him concerning his absent <lb/>

            come from Ithaca, [situate] under Neïus, and this is a private, <lb/>

            destruction: but his death the son of Saturn has made un­ <lb/>
            heard of. For no one can tell clearly where he has perished: <lb/>
            whether he has been subdued on the continent by hostile men, <lb/>
            or whether in the sea amongst the waves of Amphitrite.17 <lb/>
            Wherefore I now come to [beseech thee by] thy knees, if <lb/>
            thou art willing to tell of his mournful death, if thou hast any <lb/>
            where beheld it with thine eyes, or hast heard the tale of any one <lb/>
            else wandering: for his mother brought him forth exceedingly <lb/>
            calamitous. Nor by any means reverencing me soothe me, <lb/>
            nor pitying me, but tell me plainly, as thou hast happened to <lb/>
            witness it ;18 I beseech thee, if ever my father, the good <lb/>
            Ulysses, has performed any word or deed for thee, having <lb/>
            promised it, amongst the people of the Trojans, where you <lb/>

          <p>But to him the Gerenian knight Nestor made answer : "0 <lb/>
            friend, since thou hast put me in mind of the toil, which we sons <lb/>
            of the Grecians, irresistible in might, suffered amongst that <lb/>
            people, both whatever things live endured] with ships wan­ <lb/>
            dering over the darkling sea after booty, wheresoever Achilles <lb/>
            led us, and whatever, when we fought about the great city of <lb/>
            king Priam, where afterwards were slain as many as were <lb/>
            the bravest: there lies warlike Ajax, and there Achilles, and <lb/>
            there Patroclus, a counsellor equal to the gods, and there my <lb/>
            dear son, both brave and blameless, Antilochus, exceeding <lb/>
            swift in running, and a warrior : and many other evils besides <lb/>
            these we suffered. Who, indeed, of mortal men could relate them <lb/>
            all ? Not even if waiting five or even six years, thou shouldst <lb/>
            inquire what ills the divine Grecians suffered there. Sooner <lb/>
            indeed wouldst thou sorrowing arrive at thy paternal land: <lb/>
            for nine years we planned 19 evil things, attacking them around <lb/>
            with all kinds of stratagems ; and the son of Saturn with dif­ <lb/>
            ficulty brought them to an end. There no one wished to be <lb/>
            equal in counsel to him, since divine Ulysses, thy sire, sur­ <lb/>
            passed very much in all kinds of deceit; if in truth thou art <lb/>
            his son; astonishment possesses me as I behold thee; for in­ <lb/>
            deed thy discourse is like, nor would you say that a younger <lb/>
            man speaks so like. Whilst, then, I and divine Ulysses were <lb/>
            there, we never spoke at variance in the assembly or in the <lb/>
            council, but having one mind, we considered in our thoughts <lb/>
            and prudent reflection, by what means the beat possible things <lb/>
            might be done by the Grecians. But when we had thoroughly <lb/>
            destroyed the lofty city of Priam, and had gone away in the <lb/>
            ships, and the deity had dispersed the Grecians ; then indeed <lb/>
            Jove devised in his mind a sad return for the Greeks ; for they <lb/>
            were by no means all prudent or just: wherefore many of them <lb/>
            drew on themselves an evil fate, from the pernicious wrath of <lb/>
            the blue-eyed goddess, born of a mighty sire, who set conten <lb/>
            tion between both the sons of Atreus. But they having called <lb/>
            all the Grecians to an assembly in vain, but not according i <lb/>
            what was right, at the setting sun, (for the sons of the Gr. <lb/>
            cians came heavy with wine,) related the cause, on account ot <lb/>
            which they assembled the people. There Menelaus commanded <lb/>
            all the Grecians to be mindful of a return over the wide back <lb/>
            of the sea. But it was not altogether pleasing to Agamem <note type="footnote"> 19 Literally, " sewed." Cf. xv. 379, 423. </note> <pb n="33"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="143—179."/> <lb/>
            non ; for he wished to detain the people, and to offer sacred he­ <lb/>
            catombs, that he might appease the dreadful wrath of Minerva, <lb/>
            foolish man, nor knew he at all that he would not persuade her ; <lb/>
            for the intention of the gods who exist for ever is not soon <lb/>
            turned. Thus they stood answering one another with bitter <lb/>
            words; but the well-greaved Greeks leaped up with vast <lb/>
            clamour ; for the counsel pleased them in a divided manner. <lb/>
            During the night we rested, meditating in our mind pernicious <lb/>
            things to one another; for Jove was preparing further bane of <lb/>
            evil. But in the morning we drew our ships into the boundless <lb/>
            sea, and stowed our goods in them, and our deep-bosomed wo­ <lb/>
            men : but half the people were detained, remaining there with <lb/>
            Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, the shepherd of the people; but <lb/>
            half of us having embarked weighed anchor. And these sailed <lb/>
            very quickly ; for a god smoothed20 the whale-like21 sea. And <lb/>
            arriving at Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the gods, longing <lb/>
            for home ;22 but Jupiter did not yet design our return, severe <lb/>
            indeed, who excited evil contention again a second time. The <lb/>
            others with the prudent crafty king Ulysses embarked on the <lb/>
            ships, rowed on both sides, having turned back again, gratify­ <lb/>
            ing23 Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. But I, with the col­ <lb/>
            lected ships which followed me, fled, since I knew that the <lb/>
            deity meditated evil things. And the warlike son of Tydeus <lb/>
            fled, and incited his companions. But auburn-haired Menelaus <lb/>
            came late to us, and found us in Lesbos planning a long <lb/>
            voyage, whether we should sail about rough Chios, to the <lb/>
            island Psyria, keeping it on our left, or below Chios, near <lb/>
            windy Mimas.24 We besought the god to show us a sign ; and <lb/>
            he showed us one, and commanded us to cut the middle of the <lb/>
            sea to Eubœa, that we might escape away from evil as quickly <lb/>
            as possible. But a shrill wind sprang up and blew; and the ships <lb/>
            ran very swiftly through the fishy way; and during the night <lb/>
            were carried to Geræstus; and we offered many thighs of <lb/>
            bulls to Neptune, having measured the mighty sea. It was <note type="footnote"> 20 Literally, "spread," "strewed out." Cf. Apoll. Rhod. i. 1154, <lb/>

            Diomede, the son of Tydeus, stopped their equal ships in <lb/>
            Argos: but I kept towards Pylos; nor did the wind ever <lb/>
            drop, after the god first sent it forth to blow. Thus I ar­ <lb/>
            rived, my dear child, without any knowledge, nor have I <lb/>
            learnt any thing of them, who of the Greeks were saved, and <lb/>
            who perished. But whatever things I have heard whilst sit­ <lb/>
            ting in my palace, as far as is right, thou shalt know, nor <lb/>
            will I conceal them from thee. They say that the spear- <lb/>
            living25 Myrmidons returned well, whom the glorious son of <lb/>
            magnanimous Achilles led ; and Philoctetes [returned] well, <lb/>
            the famous SOil of Pæas ; and Idomeneus led all his companions <lb/>
            to Crete, who had escaped from the war, and the sea took away <lb/>
            no one from him; but you yourselves, although at a distance, <lb/>
            hear of the son of Atreus, both how he came, and how <lb/>
            Ægisthus devised sad death for him. But he indeed very <lb/>
            miserably paid the forfeit: so good a thing is it that a son of a <lb/>
            murdered man should be left, since he avenged himself upon <lb/>
            the murderer of his father, crafty Ægisthus, who slew his illus­ <lb/>
            trious sire. And do thou, my friend, for I see that thou art <lb/>
            noble and great, be brave, that any one even of posterity may <lb/>
            speak well of thee."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus addressed in turn: " O Nes­ <lb/>
            tor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Grecians, he did indeed <lb/>
            revenge him greatly, and the Greeks will bring to him renown <lb/>
            far and wide, and for those who shall be hereafter to learn. <lb/>
            Would that the gods would give me so much power to be re­ <lb/>

          <p>But him the Gerenian knight Nestor then answered: " O <lb/>

            these things, they say that many suitors on account of thy <lb/>
            mother devise evil things in thy palace, against thy will; tell <lb/>

            revenge their violence, being alone, or even all the Greeks <lb/>

            thee, as she then took exceeding care of glorious Ulysses <lb/>
            amongst the people of the Trojans, where we Grecians suf­ <lb/>
            fered griefs; (for I have never seen gods so openly loving, as <lb/>
            Pallas Minerva openly stood by him;) if she was thus willing <lb/>
            to love thee, and would care [for thee] in her mind, then for­ <lb/>
            sooth some one of them would be forgetful of marriage."</p>

            man, I do not at all think that this word will be brought to <lb/>
            pass; for thou hast spoken all exceeding great thing; aston­ <lb/>
            ishment possesses me; these things would not happen to me <lb/>
            if I hoped them, nor if the gods should so be willing."</p>
          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva in turn addressed : <lb/>
            "Telemachus, what word has escaped thy lips ? God, if will­ <lb/>
            ing, could easily save a man even from a distance. But I <lb/>
            should rather wish, having suffered many griefs, to come <lb/>
            home and behold the day of my return, than coming to perish <lb/>
            at my own hearth, as Agamemnon perished by the stratagem <lb/>
            of AEgisthus and his own wife.27 But indeed not even the <lb/>
            gods are able to ward off death, which is common to all,28 <lb/>
            even from a beloved man; whenever the pernicious Fate of <lb/>
            long-slumbering death seizes him."</p>
          <p>But her29 prudent Telemachus answered in turn : "Men­ <lb/>
            tor, let us no longer talk of these things although grieving. <lb/>
            For him there is no more a sure return, but already the im­ <lb/>

            since he above others is acquainted with justice and pru­ <lb/>

            truth, how did wide-ruling Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, <lb/>
            die ? Where was Menelaus ? What destruction did crafty <lb/>
            Ægisthus contrive for him ? since he slew one much his <lb/>

            indeed then tell thee all things true, my son ; for thou thyself <lb/>
            dost suspect this, as it in truth happened. If auburn-haired <lb/>
            Menelaus, SOIl of Atreus, coming from Troy had found Ægis <lb/>
            thus alive in the palace ; he would not have poured31 upon <lb/>
            him when dead the crumbled earth, but certainly dogs and <lb/>
            birds would have eaten him lying on the plain far from Ar­ <lb/>
            gos ; nor would any one of the Grecian women have mourned <lb/>
            him ; for he devised a very heinous32 deed. For we sat there <lb/>
            accomplishing many labours ; but he at leisure in the recess <lb/>
            of horse-pasturing Argos soothed the wife of Agamemnon <lb/>
            very much with words; the divine Clytemnestra herself in­ <lb/>
            deed before refused33 the disgraceful deed, for she possessed a <lb/>
            good understanding: for there was with her a man, a bard, <lb/>
            to whom the son of Atreus, when he set out to Troy, gave <lb/>
            earnest charge to preserve his wife. But when the Fate of <lb/>
            the gods bound her that she should be subdued, then leading <lb/>
            the bard to a desert island, he34 left him to become a spoil <lb/>
            and prey for birds; but he willing led her willing 35 to his <lb/>
            own home. And he burnt many thighs on the sacred altars <lb/>
            of the gods, and suspended many ornaments and tapestry, and <lb/>
            gold, after he had accomplished the heinous deed, which he <lb/>
            had never expected in his mind. Now we indeed setting out <lb/>
            from Troy sailed together, the son of Atreus and myself, hav­ <lb/>
            in--, a friendly disposition towards one another : but when we <lb/>
            came to sacred Sunium, the promontory of Athens, there <lb/>
            Phœbus Apollo,36 coming against him with his soft darts, <lb/>
            slew the pilot of Menelaus, while holding in his hands the <lb/>
            rudder of the ship as it went along, Phrontis, son of Onetor, <lb/>

            going over the dark sea in his hollow ships, came running to <lb/>
            the lofty mountain of the Maleans, then far-beholding Jove <lb/>
            decreed a hateful journey for him, and poured upon him the <lb/>
            blast of the shrill winds, and the mighty swollen waves, equal <lb/>
            to mountains; there having divided the fleet, he made part <lb/>
            approach Crete, where the Cydonians dwelt, about the stream:-, <lb/>
            of Jardanus. But there is a certain smooth lofty rock in the <lb/>
            sea, at the extremity of Gortys, in the shadowy main. There <lb/>
            the south wind thrusts the great wave to the dangerous37 <lb/>
            promontory to Phoestus; but a small rock wards off a mighty <lb/>
            wave. The ships then came here, and the men with great <lb/>
            care avoided death, but the waves broke the ships against the <lb/>
            crags; but the wind and wave bearing five azure-prowed <lb/>
            ships, made them approach to Egypt. Thus far he, collecting <lb/>
            much property and gold, wandered with his ships to men of <lb/>
            a different language. But in the mean time Ægisthus de­ <lb/>
            vised these sad things at home, having slain the SOIl of Atreus; <lb/>
            and the people were subdued under him. For seven years <lb/>

            year divine Orestes came back from Athens, an evil for him, <lb/>
            and slew the murderer of his father, crafty AEgisthus, who <lb/>
            slew his illustrious father. He then having slain him gave a <lb/>
            funeral banquet38 to the Argives for his hateful mother and <lb/>
            unwarlike Ægisthus :39 but on the same day Menelaus strenu­ <lb/>

            having made libations to Neptune and the other immortals, <lb/>
            we may think of our bed; for [this is] the hour for it. For <lb/>
            now the light is gone under the gloom; nor is it right to sit <lb/>
            long at a feast of the gods, but to return."</p>
          <p>The daughter of Jove spoke, and they heard her address­ <lb/>
            ing [them]. And the heralds poured water upon their hands, <lb/>
            and the youths crowned the bowls of wine; and they dis­ <lb/>
            tributed to all, beginning with the cups; and they threw the <lb/>
            tongues in the fire, and standing up poured out a libation. But <lb/>
            when they had made a libation, and had drunk as much as <lb/>
            their mind wished, then indeed Minerva and godlike Telema­ <lb/>
            chus both desired to go to their hollow ship; but Nestor <lb/>
            hindered them, chiding them with words:</p>

            ye should go from me to your swift ship, as from one who is <lb/>

          <p>The blue-eyed goddess Minerva addressed him in turn: <lb/>
            " Thou hast spoken these things well, O dear old man ; but <lb/>
            it is fit for thee to persuade Telemachus, since thus it is much <lb/>
            better. But he will now follow in company with you, that he <lb/>
            may sleep in your palace; but I am going to my black ship, <lb/>
            that I may cheer on my companions, and order every thing; <lb/>
            for I alone boast myself to be older amongst them, but the others <lb/>
            younger men follow on account of friendship, all of an equal age <lb/>
            with high-minded Telemachus. There I may now rest in <lb/>
            the hollow, black ship; but at dawn I am going to the mag­ <lb/>
            nanimous Cauconians, where a debt is owed me, not by any <lb/>
            means recent, or little ; but do you, since he has come to thy <lb/>
            house, send him, with a chariot and your son : and give him <lb/>
            horses, which are the fleetest to run, and most excellent in <lb/>
            strength."</p>
          <p>Having thus spoken, blue-eyed Minerva departed likened <lb/>
            unto an eagle; and astonishment seized all who beheld; and <lb/>
            the old man wondered, when he saw her with his eyes; and <lb/>
            he laid hold of the hand of Telemachus, and spoke, and said:</p>
          <p>" O friend, I do not expect that thou wilt be a coward and <lb/>
            unwarlike, since the gods thus accompany thee, who art young, <lb/>
            as thy conductors. For this was no one else of those who <lb/>
            possess the Olympian houses, than the daughter of Jove, most <lb/>
            glorious Minerva,43 who honoured also your excellent sire <lb/>
            amongst the Grecians. But, O queen, be propitious and grant <lb/>
            me good renown, for myself, and my children, and my vener­ <lb/>
            able wife; but to thee I will sacrifice a cow of one year old, <lb/>
            of a wide forehead, untamed, which man has not yet led under <lb/>
            the yoke. Her I will sacrifice to thee, having poured gold <lb/>
            round her horns."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke praying: but Pallas Minerva heard him. <lb/>
            But the Gerenian knight Nestur led them, his sons, and his <lb/>
            sons-in-law to his beautiful palace. And when they came to <lb/>
            the all-illustrious palace of the king, they sat in order on the <lb/>
            couches and the thrones. And the old man mixed for them <lb/>
            as they came a bowl of sweet wine, which the housekeeper <lb/>
            opened in the eleventh year, and loosed the fastenings.44 Of <note type="footnote"> 43 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τριτογένεια</foreign> is an epithet of Minerva, most probably derived from <lb/>

            this the old man mixed a bowl, and pouring forth a libation <lb/>
            prayed much to Minerva, daughter of Ægis-bearing Jupiter.</p>
          <p>But when they had made libations, and drank as much as <lb/>
            their mind desired, some of them went to sleep, each to their <lb/>
            own home; but the Gerenian knight Nestor made Telema­ <lb/>
            elms, the dear son of divine Ulysses, sleep there in wrought45 <lb/>
            beds under the echoing portico: and near him Pisistratus, <lb/>
            skilled in the spear, chieftain of men, who of his sons was <lb/>
            still unmarried in his palace: but himself again slept in the <lb/>
            recess of his lofty house: and for him his wife the queen pre­ <lb/>
            pared a couch and bed.</p>
          <p>But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, ap­ <lb/>
            peared, the Gerenian knight Nestor arose from his bed. And <lb/>
            coming out he sat down on the polished stones which were <lb/>
            before his lofty gates, white, shining with oil, on which Ne­ <lb/>
            leus before used to sit, a counsellor equal to the gods. But he, <lb/>
            already subdued by fate, had gone to Hades. But Gerenian <lb/>
            Nestor, the guardian of the Grecians, then sat there, holding <lb/>
            his sceptre; and around him his sons were assembled toge­ <lb/>
            ther, coming from their chambers, Echephron, and Stratius, <lb/>
            and Perseus, and Aretus, and godlike Thrasymedes ; and after <lb/>
            them the sixth, the hero Pisistratus, came; and leading god­ <lb/>
            like Telemachus they seated him near him. And the Gere­ <lb/>
            nian knight Nestor began an address to them.</p>
          <p>" Quickly, my dear children, accomplish my desire: that I <lb/>
            may supplicate Minerva first of the gods, who came manifest <lb/>
            to me to a solemn feast of the god. But let one go to the plain <lb/>
            for a heifer, that a herdsman may come with all haste, and bring <lb/>
            a heifer. And let another go to the black ship of magnanimous <lb/>
            Telemachus, and bring all his companions, but let him leave <lb/>
            two only: and let another command the goldsmith Laerceus <lb/>
            to come hither, that he may pour gold about the horns of the <lb/>
            heifer. But do the rest of you remain here together, and <lb/>
            bid the handmaidens within prepare a glorious feast in the <lb/>
            palace, and place seats and wood around, and bring clear <lb/>
            water."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and they all were busily occupied ; a heifer <note type="footnote"> 45 Cf. i. 440, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ τρητοι̃ς λεχέεσσιν</foreign> Loewe thinks the simplest way <lb/>

            then came from the plain: and the companions of magna­ <lb/>
            nimous Telemachus came from the swift equal ship; and the <lb/>
            smith came, having his brazen instruments in his hands, the <lb/>
            implements of art, an anvil and hammer, and well-made tongs, <lb/>
            with which he worked the gold; and Minerva came to par­ <lb/>
            take of the sacred rites: and the old horseman Nestor gave <lb/>
            the gold: but he then, having prepared it, poured it around <lb/>
            the horns of the heifer, that the goddess might rejoice on be­ <lb/>
            holding the ornament. But Stratius and divine Echephron <lb/>
            led the heifer by the horns : and Aretus came, bringing water <lb/>
            from the chamber in a cauldron embossed with flowers ; and <lb/>
            in the other hand he held cakes in a basket. But Thrasy­ <lb/>
            medes, persevering in the fight, stood near, holding in his <lb/>
            hand a sharp axe, to strike the heifer. And Perseus held the <lb/>
            vessel for catching the blood ;46 and the old horseman Nestor <lb/>
            began with [sprinkling] the water and the cakes : and having <lb/>
            offered the first-fruits, he prayed much to Minerva, throwing <lb/>
            the hairs of the head in the fire. But when they had prayed <lb/>
            and thrown forth the cakes, straightway high-minded Thra­ <lb/>
            symedes, the son of Nestor, standing near struck the blow; <lb/>
            and the hatchet cut the tendons of the neck, and loosed the <lb/>
            strength of the heifer. But they shouted, the daughters and <lb/>
            daughters-in-law, and Eurydice, the venerable wife of Nestor, <lb/>
            the eldest of the daughters of Clymenus. They then raising <lb/>
            it up from the spacious earth held it; but Pisistratus, chief­ <lb/>
            tain of men, killed it. And when the black blood flowed from <lb/>
            it, and life had left its bones, they quickly divided it; and soon <lb/>
            cut off all the thighs, as was right, and covered them with fat, <lb/>
            having doubled them ; and put the raw parts upon them: and <lb/>
            the old man roasted them on the faggots, and poured glowing <lb/>
            wine over them; and near him the young men held in their <lb/>
            hands five-pronged spits. But when the thighs were burnt, <lb/>
            and they had tasted the entrails, they both cut up the other <lb/>
            parts into bits, and fixed them on spits, and roasted them, <lb/>
            holding in their hands the sharp spits. But meanwhile beau­ <lb/>

            Neleus, washed Telemachus. But when she had washed him, <lb/>

            roasted the upper parts and had separated them, they sat down <lb/>
            and feasted; and the excellent men arose, pouring wine into <lb/>
            the golden cups. But when they had taken away the desire <lb/>
            of eating and drinking, the Gerenian knight Nestor began to <lb/>
            address them :</p>
          <p>" My sons, come, lead forth, and yoke under the chariot <lb/>
            beautiful-haired horses for Telemachus, that he may perform <lb/>
            his journey."</p>

            and they swiftly yoked the swift horses under the chariot; <lb/>
            and the housekeeper placed in it bread and wine, and dainties, <lb/>
            such as Jove-nourished kings eat. Telemachus then mounted <lb/>
            the very beautiful chariot; and near him Pisistratus, the <lb/>
            chieftain of men, son of Nestor, mounted the chariot, and took <lb/>
            the reins in his hands, and scourged them that they might go <lb/>
            on; and they twain flew not unwilling to the plain, and left <lb/>
            the lofty citadel of Pylos. And all the day they shook the <lb/>
            yoke holding it on both sides: and the sun set, and all the <lb/>
            ways were overshadowed. And they came to Pheræ, to the <lb/>
            house of Diodes, son of Orsilochus, whom Alpheus begot for <lb/>
            his son. There they rested during the night; and he gave <lb/>
            them hospitable gifts.</p>
          <p>But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, ap­ <lb/>
            peared, they yoked the horses and mounted the variegated <lb/>
            chariots: land drove out of the vestibule, and the resounding <lb/>

            and they twain flew not unwilling: and they came to the <lb/>
            wheat-producing plain ; there then they finished their jour­ <lb/>

            Menelaus then gives him the particulars of the return of the Grecians, as <lb/>
            far as he is acquainted with them ; and informs Telemachus that he had <lb/>
            been acquainted by Proteus, that Ulysses was being detained by Calypso. <lb/>
            At Ithaca, in the mean time, the suitors in council determine to lay wait <lb/>
            for Telemachus on his return, and put him to death. Minerva comforts <lb/>
            Penelope, who was afflicted at her son's absence, by a dream, appearing <lb/>

          <p>THEY came to hollow Lacedæmon with its many clefts ;1 and <lb/>

            spotless daughter, to many friends.2 Her he sent to the son <lb/>
            of the warlike Achilles; for in Troy he first promised and <lb/>
            agreed that he would bestow her : and the gods brought their <lb/>
            marriage to pass. He sent her to go there with horses and <lb/>
            chariots, to the illustrious city of the Myrmidons, over whom <lb/>
            he reigned: and to his son he brought from Sparta the <lb/>
            daughter of Alector, who was born to him in his old age, <lb/>
            brave Megapenthes, from a slave : but the gods no more gave an <lb/>

            trusty servant of glorious Menelaus, coming forward, saw <lb/>
            them; and he hastened through the house to announce them <lb/>
            to glorious Menelaus; and standing near him spoke winged <lb/>
            words:</p>
          <p>" There are some strangers here, O Menelaus, nourished <lb/>
            of Jupiter, two men, and they are like unto the race of mighty <lb/>
            Jove. But say, whether we shall loose their swift horses <lb/>
            or send them to go to some one else, who may receive them <lb/>
            kindly."</p>
          <p>Auburn-haired Menelaus very indignant addressed him : <lb/>
            Formerly, indeed thou wast not foolish, O Eteoneus, son of <lb/>
            Böetheus, but now, like a child, thou speakest foolish things. <lb/>
            We indeed having consumed many hospitable gifts from other <lb/>
            men came here; [to see] if Jupiter even hereafter shall allow <lb/>
            us to cease from toil; 4 but loose the horses of the strangers, <lb/>
            and bring them in immediately to be feasted."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and he hastened from the palace, and ex <lb/>
            horted his other trusty servants to follow him. But they <lb/>
            loosed the horses sweating under the yoke; and bound them <lb/>
            to the horses' manger: and they set oats near them, and mixed <lb/>
            white barley with them: and they tilted the chariot against <lb/>
            the shining walls, and led them into the divine house: but <lb/>
            they, beholding, marvelled at the house of the Jove-nurtured <lb/>
            king. For there was a splendour like as of the sun and the <lb/>
            moon, through the lofty-roofed house of glorious Menebus. <lb/>
            But when, beholding with their eyes, they were satisfied, going <lb/>
            into the well-polished baths they washed themselves. When <lb/>
            therefore the maid-servants had washed them, and anointed <lb/>
            them with oil, and had also thrown woollen cloaks and gar­ <lb/>
            ments around them, they set them on thrones near Menelaus, <lb/>
            the son of Atreus. And a handmaid bringing water in a beau­ <lb/>
            tiful golden ewer, poured it over a silver cauldron, to wash <lb/>
            in : and she spread a polished table near at hand. And the <lb/>
            venerable housekeeper brought bread and set it near them, <lb/>
            serving up many dainties, gratifying them as well as she <lb/>
            could out of the provisions that were at hand. And the waiter <lb/>
            lifting up dishes of all kinds of flesh placed them near; and <note type="footnote"> a On this meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρείων</foreign> see Loewe. </note><note type="footnote"> * I have some doubts about this passage. </note> <pb n="45"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="59—96."/> <lb/>
            set near them golden cups. Auburn-haired Menelaus then <lb/>
            giving them his right hand addressed them :</p>
          <p>"Both taste food and rejoice ; but when ye twain have eaten <lb/>
            of supper, we will inquire of you, who of men you are; for <lb/>
            the race of your parents has not perished ; but ye are the race <lb/>
            of Jove-nurtured, sceptre-bearing kings; for bad men would <lb/>
            not produce such as ye are."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, and he set near them the fat back of an <lb/>
            ox, taking in his hands the roasted part, which they had <lb/>
            placed near him as an honour: and they stretched forth their <lb/>
            hands to the viands lying ready before them. But when they <lb/>
            had taken away the desire of drinking and eating, then Te­ <lb/>
            lemachus addressed the son of Nestor, holding his head near, <lb/>
            that the others might not hear:</p>
          <p>" Consider, thou son of Nestor, most pleasing to my mind, <lb/>
            the shining of the brass throughout the resounding house, <lb/>
            and of gold, and amber, and silver, and ivory. Some such, <lb/>
            forsooth, is the hall of the Olympian Jupiter within. How <lb/>
            many vast things are here! astonishment possesses me as I <lb/>
            behold them."</p>
          <p>Auburn-haired Menelaus understood him speaking, and <lb/>
            addressing them, spoke winged words :</p>
          <p>" My sons, no one indeed of mortals would contend with <lb/>
            Jove; for immortal are his houses and possessions; but any <lb/>
            one of mortals would either contend with me in possessions, <lb/>
            or not. Certainly, having suffered many things, and having <lb/>
            wandered much, I was brought in my ships, and I returned <lb/>
            in the eighth year : having wandered to Cyprus, and Phœnice, <lb/>
            and the Ægyptians, I came to the Æthiopians and Sidonians, <lb/>
            and Erembians, and Libya, where the lambs immediately be­ <lb/>
            come horned. For the sheep bring forth thrice in a whole <lb/>
            year: there indeed neither king nor shepherd is in want of <lb/>
            cheese and flesh, nor of sweet milk; but they always furnish <lb/>
            milk for milking throughout the year. Whilst I wandered <lb/>
            collecting much livelihood in those places, in the mean while <lb/>
            another slew my brother secretly, unexpectedly, through the <lb/>
            deceit of his pernicious wife: so I by no means rejoicing rule <lb/>
            over these possessions. And ye must have heard these things <lb/>
            from your fathers, whoever they be ; for I have suffered very <lb/>
            many things, and have lost my house, which was very well <lb/>
            inhabited, containing many and excellent things. Of which <pb n="46"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="97—138."/> <lb/>
            I would wish having even the third part to dwell in my house, <lb/>
            and that the men should be safe who then perished in spa­ <lb/>
            cious Troy far from horse-pasturing Argos. But however <lb/>
            mourning and grieving for all, ofttimes sitting in my palace, <lb/>
            sometimes I am delighted in my mind with grief, at other <lb/>
            times again I rest; but the satiety of chilly grief is quick. I <lb/>
            do not so much lament for all these, although saddened, as for <lb/>
            one, who makes my sleep and my food hateful to me, when I <lb/>
            call him to mind; since no one of the Grecians laboured so <lb/>
            much, as Ulysses laboured and endured; but for him indeed <lb/>
            it was fated that there should be sad cares, but to me grief <lb/>
            never to be forgotten on account of him, since indeed he is a <lb/>
            long time absent, nor do we know at all whether he is alive <lb/>
            or dead. Old Laertes, and prudent Penelope, and Telemachus <lb/>
            whom he left lately born in his house, are now some where <lb/>
            mourning for him."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and he excited in him the desire of grief <lb/>
            on account of his sire. And he shed tears from his eyelids <lb/>
            on the ground, hearing of his father, holding up a purple <lb/>
            mantle before his eyes with both his hands. And Menelaus <lb/>
            perceived him, and then he meditated in his thoughts and in <lb/>
            his mind, whether he should leave him to make mention of <lb/>
            his father, or should ask him first, and inquire of him every <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>Whilst he meditated these things in his thoughts and in <lb/>
            his mind, Helen came out of the sweet-smelling, lofty-roofed <lb/>
            chamber, like unto Diana of the golden distaff. For her <lb/>
            Adrasta immediately placed a well-made seat; and Alcippe <lb/>
            brought tapestry of soft wool ; and Phylo brought a silver <lb/>
            basket, which Aleandra the wife of Polybus gave her, who <lb/>
            dwelt in Egyptian Thebes, where very many possessions lie <lb/>
            in his house: who gave to Menelaus two silver baths, and <lb/>
            two tripods, and ten talents of gold; and his wife moreover <lb/>
            gave beautiful gifts to Helen; she presented a golden distaff, <lb/>
            and a round basket, silver, but the lips were finished with <lb/>
            gold. This indeed the handmaid Phylo brought and placed <lb/>
            near her, filled with well-dressed thread; and upon it the dis­ <lb/>
            taff was stretched, containing violet-coloured wool. And she <lb/>
            sat on the seat, and a foot-stool was under her feet: and she <lb/>
            straightway inquired every thing of her husband with words:</p>
          <p>"Do we know, O thou Jove-nurtured Menelaus, what <pb n="47"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="139-175."/> <lb/>
            men these are who profess to come to our house ? Shall I say <lb/>
            false, or shall I speak the truth ? For my mind exhorts me. <lb/>
            For I say that I have never seen any man or woman so like <lb/>
            (reverence possesses me as I behold him) as he is like unto <lb/>
            Telemachus, the son of magnanimous Ulysses, whom that <lb/>
            man left lately born in his house, when ye Grecians came to <lb/>
            Troy on account of me, immodest one, arousing fierce war."</p>
          <p>Auburn-haired Menelaus answering addressed her: " So <lb/>
            now I too am thinking, my wife, as thou dost conjecture. For <lb/>
            such are his feet, and such his hands, and the cast of his eyes, <lb/>
            and his head and his locks above. And I just now, making <lb/>
            mention of Ulysses, related what things he undergoing la­ <lb/>
            bour suffered on my account; but he shed a bitter tear from <lb/>
            nis eyelids, holding up his purple mantle before his eyes."</p>
          <p>Pisistratus, the son of Nestor, addressed him in answer: <lb/>
            " O Menelaus, son of Atreus, nurtured of Jove, chieftain of <lb/>
            the people, he is truly his son, as thou sayest; [but he is <lb/>
            prudent, and is indignant in mind, coming hither first to <lb/>
            show the forwardness by entering first on the discourse in <lb/>
            your presence,5 with whose voice, as of a god, we are de­ <lb/>
            lighted.] But the Gerenian knight Nestor sent me forth, to <lb/>
            accompany him as a guide; for he desired to see thee, that <lb/>
            thou mayest suggest some word or some deed to him. For <lb/>
            the son of an absent father, to whom there are no other as­ <lb/>
            sistants, suffers many griefs in his palace; so now is it with <lb/>
            Telemachus ; he indeed is gone, nor are there others amongst <lb/>
            the people who may ward off calamity."</p>
          <p>But him auburn-haired Menelaus answering addressed: <lb/>
            " O gods! !6 of a truth the son of a very dear man, who for my <lb/>
            sake hath laboured through many toils, has come to my <lb/>
            house. And I said that I would receive him with kindness <lb/>
            above the rest of the Grecians, upon returning, if wide- <lb/>
            thundering Olympian Jove had granted that there should be <lb/>
            a return for us over the sea in our swift ships : and I would <lb/>
            have founded a city in Argos for him, and would have built <note type="footnote"> 5 The Scholiast explains these words in three different ways : " to shew <lb/>
            the reproaches thrown upon him by the suitors," or " to relate the re­ <lb/>
            proaches cast on his house," or as it is here translated, " he is too modest <lb/>
            to speak first." Old Transl. See Loewe, who, with one of the Scholiasts, <lb/>
            is inclined to condemn these verses as spurious. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 See on i. 32. </note> <pb n="48"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="176-214,"/> <lb/>
            houses, bringing him from Ithaca with his possessions and his <lb/>
            son, [and all his people, having sacked one city of those, <lb/>
            which are inhabited around, but are ruled over by me my­ <lb/>
            self.] And we being here, would frequently have associated <lb/>
            together; nor would any thing else have separated us twain, <lb/>
            being kind to and delighting one another, before at least the <lb/>
            time when the black cloud of death had enveloped us. But <lb/>
            perhaps the deity himself would have envied these things, <lb/>
            . who made him alone wretched without a return.</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, but he excited in them all a desire of grief. <lb/>
            Argive Helen born of Jupiter wept, Telemachus wept, and <lb/>
            Meuelaus the son of Atreus; nor did the son of Nestor keep <lb/>
            his eyes tearless: for he remembered in his mind blameless <lb/>
            Antilochus, whom the glorious son of shining Aurora slew ; <lb/>
            remembering him he spoke winged words :</p>
          <p>" O soil of Atreus, aged Nestor said that thou art prudent <lb/>
            above mortals, when we mentioned thee Ein his palace, and <lb/>
            were inquiring of one another]. And now, if it is at all pos­ <lb/>
            sible, obey me ; for I am not delighted, weeping at supper- <lb/>
            time ; but Aurora, the mother of dawn, will soon be present; <lb/>
            I am not at all indignant at weeping for one, who amongst <lb/>
            mortals is dead, and has drawn on his fate. This indeed is <lb/>
            the only honour to be paid to wretched mortals, to clip the <lb/>
            hair, and to pour the tear down from the cheeks. For mv <lb/>
            brother too died, who was by no means the worst of the Gre­ <lb/>
            cians, as thou must be aware; for I have not met with nor <lb/>
            seen him, as they say that Antilochus excelled others, that <lb/>
            he was exceeding fleet to run, and a warrior."</p>
          <p>Auburn-haired Menelaus addressed him in answer: " O <lb/>
            friend, since thou hast spoken such things, as a prudent man <lb/>
            would speak and do, even one who was more advanced; (for <lb/>
            thou art born of such a father, wherefore thou speakest pru­ <lb/>
            dent things;) but the son of a man, to whom the son of Sa­ <lb/>
            turn has destined happiness when he marries, and when he <lb/>
            begets children, is easily to be distinguished. As he has nov <lb/>
            given to Nestor all his days continually, that he himsell <lb/>
            should grow old comfortably in his palace, and that his sons <lb/>
            should be prudent, and excellent in the use of the spear. But <lb/>
            let us indeed leave off our mourning, which was before: and <lb/>
            let us again remember our supper, and let them pour water <lb/>
            on our hands: but in the morning there shall be conversation <pb n="49"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="215-250."/> <lb/>
            between Telemachus and me, that we may discourse with one <lb/>
            another."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but Asphalion, the trusty servant of <lb/>
            glorious Menelaus, poured water over their hands. And they <lb/>
            stretched forth their hands to the viands that were lying <lb/>
            ready. There then Jove-descended Helen planned other <lb/>
            things. She straightway cast a drug into the wine, from <lb/>
            whence they were drinking, that frees men from grief and from <lb/>
            anger, and causes oblivion of all ills. Whoever should drink <lb/>
            down this, when it is mixed in a cup, would not shed a tear <lb/>
            down his cheeks for a whole day, not even if both his mother <lb/>
            and father should die, nor if they should slay with the steel <lb/>
            a brother or a beloved son before him, and he should be­ <lb/>
            hold it with his eyes. Such cunning and excellent drugs <lb/>
            the daughter of Jove possessed, which Polydamna, the wife <lb/>
            of Thone, gave her, an Egyptian ; where the bounteous land <lb/>
            produces very many drugs, many excellent when mingled, <lb/>
            and many fatal; and each physician7 is skilled above all <lb/>
            men ; for truly they are of the race of Pæon.8 But when she <lb/>
            put it in, and ordered them to pour wine over it, straightway <lb/>
            addressing them with words, she spoke:</p>
          <p>" O Menelaus, thou Jove-nurtured son of Atreus, and also <lb/>
            these sons of brave men-but the god Jupiter gives both good <lb/>
            and evil, sometimes to one and sometimes to another; for he <lb/>
            is able [to do] all things-now however feast, sitting in the <lb/>
            palace, and delight yourselves with conversation; for I will <lb/>
            relate fitting things. I could not indeed relate or name all <lb/>
            things, as many as are the labours of patient Ulysses: but <lb/>
            what that was, which the brave man did and suffered amongst <lb/>
            the people of the Trojans, where ye Greeks suffered calami­ <lb/>
            ties. Having inflicted on himself unseemly blows, throwing <lb/>
            vile garments about his shoulders, like a servant, he entered <lb/>
            the city of the enemy with its spacious streets. But conceal­ <lb/>
            ing himself he likened himself unto another man, a beggar, he <lb/>
            who was by no means such a one at the ships of the Grecians ; <lb/>
            like unto him he entered the city of the Trojans; and they <lb/>
            all knew him not;9 but I alone recognised him, although he <note type="footnote"> 7 1. e. the physicians of Egypt. Cf. Herodot. ii. 77, 84. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Homer distinguishes between Apollo and Pæon. Cf. If. v. 401, and <lb/>

            was such a one ; and I put questions to him, but he avoided me <lb/>
            by his craft. But when indeed I washed him and anointed him <lb/>
            with oil, and put garments on him, and swore a firm oath, that <lb/>
            I would not make Ulysses manifest to the Trojans, before he <lb/>
            came to the swift ships and the tents ; then at length he de­ <lb/>
            clared to me the whole intention of the Grecians, And hav­ <lb/>
            ing slain many of the Trojans with the long-pointed steel, he <lb/>
            came to the Argives; and he brought back much intelli­ <lb/>
            gence.10 There the other Trojan women wailed shrilly ; but <lb/>
            my heart rejoiced; for now indeed my mind was inclined to <lb/>
            return home again ; but I lamented the calamity, which <lb/>
            Venus had given, when she led me thither from my dear <lb/>
            paternal land, and separated my daughter [from me], and my <lb/>
            chamber, and my husband, who was not at all deficient, either <lb/>
            as to his understanding or his form."</p>
          <p>But auburn-haired Menelaus addressed her in turn: " Of <lb/>
            a truth, wife, thou hast spoken all these things rightly. I <lb/>
            have now, indeed, learned the counsel and mind of many <lb/>
            heroes, and have passed over much land; but I have not yet <lb/>
            seen such a one with my eyes, so kind as was the heart of <lb/>
            patient Ulysses, and such a thing as that which the brave man <lb/>
            did and suffered in the polished horse, wherein we all, chiefs <lb/>
            of the Grecians, sat in ambush, bringing slaughter and fate <lb/>
            upon the Trojans. Then thou earnest thither ; but the deity, <lb/>
            who wished to give glory to the Trojans, must have exhorted <lb/>
            thee, although godlike Deiphobus followed thee as thou went­ <lb/>

            the son of Tydeus, and divine Ulysses sitting in the middle, <lb/>
            heard how thou calledst aloud. Both of us indeed were <lb/>
            anxious, having rushed forth either to go out, or to answer thee <lb/>
            immediately from within ; but Ulysses hindered us and re­ <lb/>
            strained us, although desirous. [There all the other sons of <lb/>

          <p>But him prudent Telemachus addressed in turn : " O Me­ <lb/>
            nelaus, Jove-nurtured son of Atreus, chieftain of the people, <lb/>
            it is more grievous; for these things did in no wise avert sad <lb/>
            death from him, not even if his heart was of steel within. <lb/>
            But come, send us to bed, that we may now be delighted <lb/>
            with sweet sleep, being laid down to rest."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and Argive Helen ordered the maid-serv­ <lb/>
            ants to place couches under the portico, and to throw on them <lb/>
            beautiful purple rugs, and to strew tapestry on the top, and tc <lb/>
            place on them woollen cloaks to cover them above. But they <lb/>
            went from the palace, holding a torch in their hands : and <lb/>
            they strewed the couches; and the herald led out the guests. <lb/>
            They indeed, the hero Telemachus and the illustrious son of <lb/>
            Nestor, lay there in the vestibule of the house; but the son <lb/>
            of Atreus slept in the recess of the lofty house, and near him <lb/>
            lay long-robed Helen, a divine one amongst women. But <lb/>
            when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, appeared, <lb/>
            Menelaus, gallant in the din of battle, arose from his bed, <lb/>
            having put on his garments ; and around his shoulder he girded <lb/>
            a sharp sword, and beneath his shining feet he bound beauti­ <lb/>
            ful sandals; and hastened from the chamber like unto a god <lb/>
            to behold, and he sat near Telemachus, and spoke, and called <lb/>
            him by name:</p>
          <p>"What necessity brought thee hither, O hero Telemachus, <lb/>
            to divine Lacedæmon, over the wide back of the sea? Public <lb/>
            or private ? tell me this truly."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn: "0 Me­ <lb/>

            am come [to see] if perchance thou couldst tell me any report <lb/>
            concerning my father. My house is being consumed, and rich <lb/>
            tillages are perishing. And my house is full of hostile men, <lb/>
            who are constantly slaying my tender sheep, and my curve- <lb/>
            footed, crooked-horned oxen, suitors of my mother, possessing <lb/>
            over-bearing insolence. Wherefore I come to thy knees, if <lb/>
            thou art willing to tell of his mournful death, if thou hast any <lb/>
            where beheld it with thine eyes, or hast heard the tale of any <lb/>
            one else wandering: for his mother brought him forth ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly calamitous. Nor by any means reverencing me, <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <pb n="52"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="326—365"/> <lb/>
            be gentle, nor pitying me, but tell me plainly as thou hast met <lb/>
            with the sight [of it] ; I beseech thee, if ever my father, good <lb/>
            Ulysses, has accomplished any word or deed for you, having <lb/>
            undertaken it amongst the people of the Trojans, where ye <lb/>
            Greeks suffered losses, be mindful of these things now, and <lb/>
            tell me true."</p>
          <p>And auburn-haired Menelaus mourning greatly addressed <lb/>
            him : " O gods ! indeed they have sought to lie in the bed of <lb/>
            a stout-hearted man, themselves being weak. As when a <lb/>
            hart, having laid her new-born suckling fawns in the den <lb/>
            of a strong lion. feeding, searches the thickets12 and grassy <lb/>
            valleys, but he then has entered his lair, and on them both <lb/>
            has brought a severe fate ; so Ulysses will bring a severe fate <lb/>
            upon those men. I wish, O father Jupiter, and Minerva and <lb/>
            Apollo, being such formerly, in well-built Lesbos, rising he <lb/>
            wrestled in contention with the son of Philomela,13 and threw <lb/>
            him with violence, and all the Greeks rejoiced. Should Ulysses, <lb/>
            being such a one, engage with the suitors, [all would be quick <lb/>
            fated, and would have a bitter marriage.] But as to these <lb/>
            things, which thou inquirest and beseechest of me, I would <lb/>
            not tell thee other things besides, indirectly, nor will I de­ <lb/>
            ceive thee: but as to the things which the true old man14 of <lb/>
            the sea told me, of these I will by no means hide or conceal <lb/>
            a word from you.</p>
          <p>" The gods detained me in Egypt, desiring to return hither, <lb/>
            since I did not offer up to them perfect hecatombs: [but the gods <lb/>
            always wish that we should be mindful of their commands.] <lb/>
            There is a certain island then in a boisterous sea, before <lb/>
            Egypt,-they call it Pharos,-so far distant as a hollow ship <lb/>
            would make in a whole day, when a whistling wind should blow <lb/>
            on from behind. But in it there is a haven with good moor- ' <lb/>
            ing, from whence they take equal ships into the sea, having <lb/>
            drawn black water. There for twenty days the gods detained <lb/>
            me, nor did favourable winds ever appear blowing on the sea, <lb/>
            which are the conveyers of ships over the wide back of the <lb/>
            ocean. And now all my provisions would have been consumed, <lb/>
            and the strength of my men [would have failed], had not <lb/>
            one of the goddesses taken pity on me, and preserved me, <lb/>
            Idothea, daughter of illustrious Proteus, the old man of the <note type="footnote"> 12Or, the fc ot of a mountain. </note><note type="footnote">13 Patreclus </note><note type="footnote">14 Proteus. </note> <pb n="53"/>

            sea: for I very much moved her mind, who met me wander­ <lb/>
            ing alone, at a distance from my companions; for they, con­ <lb/>
            stantly wandering about the island, fished with crooked hooks ; <lb/>
            for hunger subdued their belly. But she standing near me <lb/>
            spoke, and said, ' Thou art exceedingly foolish, O stranger, or <lb/>
            remiss in mind, or thou art willingly neglectful, and art de­ <lb/>
            lighted at suffering griefs; thus now thou art a long time <lb/>
            detained in an island, nor canst thou discover any means of <lb/>
            escape, and the heart of thy companions wastes away.'</p>
          <p>" Thus she spoke ; and I addressed her in answer: ' I will <lb/>
            tell thee, indeed, whoever thou art of the goddesses, that I am <lb/>
            by no means willingly detained ; but I must have sinned against <lb/>
            the immortals, who possess the wide heaven ; but do thou tell <lb/>
            me, for the gods ken all things, who of the immortals hinders <lb/>
            me, and has bound me from my journey, and [tell me of] my <lb/>
            return, how I shall go over the fishy sea.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; but she, the divine one of goddesses, im­ <lb/>
            mediately answered: ' I will tell thee, indeed, O stranger, <lb/>
            very correctly. A certain true old man of the sea has his <lb/>
            haunts here, immortal Proteus the Egyptian, who is acquaint­ <lb/>
            ed with the depths of the whole sea, the servant of Neptune ; <lb/>
            they say that he is my father, and that he begot me. Him if <lb/>
            thou couldst by any means insnare and take, he would tell <lb/>
            thee the way and the measures of the track, and thy return, <lb/>
            how thou mayest go over the fishy sea. And he will tell thee, <lb/>
            besides, O noble one, if he chooses, what evil and good has <lb/>
            happened in thy palace, whilst thou wast absent on a long and <lb/>
            difficult journey.'</p>
          <p>" Thus she spoke ; but I addressed her in answer: ' Do <lb/>
            thou now thyself bethink thee of the snare for the divine old <lb/>
            man, lest by any means foreseeing me, or knowing beforehand, <lb/>
            he should escape me: for a god is difficult to be subdued by a <lb/>
            mortal man.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke ; but she, divine one of goddesses straight­ <lb/>
            way answered: ' Therefore, O stranger, will I tell thee very <lb/>
            correctly. When the sun has, gone round up to the middle of <lb/>
            the heaven, then the unerring old man of the sea comes forth <lb/>
            from the deep, under the breathing of the west wind, covered <lb/>
            with the black foam; and having gone out, he lies down to <lb/>
            rest under the hollow caves. But around him sea-calves, the <pb n="54"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="405—437"/> <lb/>
            offspring15 of fair Halosydna, sleep together, emerging from <lb/>
            the hoary sea, breathing forth a bitter smell of the deep sea. <lb/>
            There I will lead thee, together with the appearance of morn, <lb/>
            and lay thee in order; but do thou choose well three companions, <lb/>
            who are the best at your well-benched ships ; but I will tell thee <lb/>
            all the terrible tricks10 of the old man. First he will reckon and <lb/>
            go over the sea-calves; and when he has numbered all on his <lb/>
            five fingers, and has seen them, he will lie down in the middle, <lb/>
            as a shepherd among a flock of sheep. And when thou shalt <lb/>
            have first seen him laid to sleep, then let strength and force be <lb/>
            thy care to keep him there, although desirous and striving to <lb/>
            escape. But he will make the attempt, becoming all things, <lb/>
            whatsoever reptiles are upon the earth, and water, and fire <lb/>
            that blazes from the gods ;17 but do thou keep him firmly, <lb/>
            and press him still more. But when he himself'shall ask thee <lb/>
            with words, being such as thou sawest him when asleep, then, <lb/>
            O hero, desist from force, and loose the old man: but ask <lb/>
            him, who of the gods hurts thee, and about thy return, how <lb/>
            thou mayest go over the fishy sea.'</p>
          <p>" Thus having spoken, she dived under the billowy sea: but <lb/>
            I went to the ships, where they stood on the sands ; but my heart <lb/>
            was deeply troubled18 much as I went. But when I came to <lb/>
            the ship and to the sea, we made ready a supper, and ambro­ <lb/>
            sial night came on ; then we lay down to rest on the shore of <lb/>
            the sea. But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morn­ <lb/>
            ing, appeared, then I went to the shore of the wide-wayed sea, <lb/>
            much supplicating the gods ; and I took three companions, in <lb/>
            whom I most trusted for every attempt. But in the mean <lb/>
            time she, having dived beneath the wide bosom of the sea, <lb/>
            brought from the deep four skins of sea-calves; and all were <lb/>
            fresh-skinned, and she planned a stratagem against her sire; <note type="footnote"> 15 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νέποδες</foreign> = " without feet," or " that make their way by swimming." <lb/>

              and having hollowed out beds in the sands of the sea. she sat <lb/>
              waiting, but we came very near to her; and she laid us down <lb/>
              in order, and threw a skin over each of us. There, however, <lb/>
              the ambush was most grievous; for a most pernicious smell <lb/>
              [from the skins] of sea-nourished calves afflicted us horri­ <lb/>
              bly: for who would sleep near a whale of the sea? But she <lb/>
              preserved us and bethought her of a mighty remedy; she <lb/>
              brought ambrosia and placed it under the nostrils of each, <lb/>
              which breathed very pleasantly, and destroyed the smell of <lb/>
              the whale. And we waited the whole morning with patient <lb/>
              mind. And the sea-calves came together from the sea; they <lb/>
              then lay in order near the shore of the sea. And the old man <lb/>
              at mid-day came from the sea, and found the well-nourished <lb/>
              sea-calves; and he went over all and counted their number. <lb/>
              And he counted us first amongst the whales, nor did he at all <lb/>
              suspect in his mind that itwas a trick ; and then he himself also <lb/>
              lay down. But we immediately shouting rushed upon him ; and <lb/>
              threw our hands around him: nor did the old man forget his <lb/>
              wily art. And first indeed he became a lion with noble mane, <lb/>
              and then a dragon, and a leopard, and a great boar; and he <lb/>
              became liquid water and a lofty-leaved tree. But we held him <lb/>
              firmly with patient mind ; and when at length the old man <lb/>
              mourned, skilled in terrible tricks, then inquiring of me with <lb/>
              words he addressed me; ' Who of the gods, thou son of Atreus, <lb/>
              planned counsels for thee, that thou mightest take me against <lb/>
              my will, having insnared me? of what hast thou need?' <lb/>
              " Thus he spoke; but I addressed him in answer : ' Thou <lb/>
              knowest, old man—why dost thou ask me these things, de­ <lb/>
              ceiving me ? Since I am now detained a long time in the <lb/>
              island, nor can I find any means of escape, and my heart <lb/>
              wastes away within me. But do thou tell me, for the gods <lb/>
              know all things, who of the immortals hinders me, and has <lb/>
              bound me from my journey, and [tell me about] my return, <lb/>
              how shall I go over the fishy sea.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; but he answering again addressed me: <lb/>
            But thou oughtest by all means to embark, having offered <lb/>
            favourable sacrifices to Jupiter, and the other gods, that thou <lb/>
            mayest come as quick as possible to thy country, sailing <lb/>
            over the dark sea. For it is not the destiny for thee to be­ <lb/>
            hold thy friends and to come to thy well-built house and thy <lb/>
            paternal land, before thou shalt return again to the water of <pb n="56"/>

            hecatombs to the immortal gods, who possess the wide heaven : <lb/>
            and then the gods will grant thee the journey for which thou <lb/>
            art anxious.'</p>
          <p>" Thus he spoke; but my dear heart was grievously af­ <lb/>
            flicted, because he commanded me to go again to Egypt over <lb/>
            the shadowy sea, a long and difficult journey. But even so <lb/>
            answering him with words I addressed him: ' These things I <lb/>
            will indeed so perform, O old man, as thou commandest. But <lb/>
            come, tell me this and relate it truly, if all the Grecians have <lb/>
            returned with their ships, unhurt, whom Nestor and I left <lb/>
            when we set out from Troy, or has any one perished with <lb/>
            unlooked-for death in his ship, or in the hands of his friends <lb/>
            after he had brought the war to an end ?'20</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; but he again answering addressed me: <lb/>
            ' O son of Atreus, why dost thou ask me these things ? It is <lb/>
            not at all fit that thou shouldst know or learn my mind ; nor <lb/>
            do I think that thou wilt long be without weeping, when <lb/>
            thou hast heard all things rightly. Many of these have been <lb/>
            subdued and many have been left. But two leaders only <lb/>
            of the brazen breastplated Grecians have perished in their <lb/>
            return; for thou also wast present at the battle: and one is <lb/>
            still detained some where alive on the wide sea. Ajax indeed <lb/>
            was subdued amongst the long-oared ships ; first Neptune made <lb/>
            him approach to the great rocks Gyræ, and saved him from <lb/>
            the sea; and now he would have escaped death, although <lb/>
            hated by Minerva, had he not thrown out a haughty expres­ <lb/>
            sion, and he was greatly hurt :21 for he said that he would <lb/>
            escape the mighty wave of the sea against the will of the gods. <lb/>
            And Neptune heard him boasting great things. Immediately <lb/>
            then taking his trident in his sturdy hands, he struck the <lb/>
            Gyrean rock, and cut it off. And one [part] remained there, <lb/>
            but another fragment fell into the sea; upon this Ajax at first <lb/>
            sitting was greatly hurt, for it carried him into the vast bil­ <lb/>
            lowy sea. [Thus he perisned there, when he drank salt <lb/>
            water.] But thy brother by some means avoided death, and <lb/>

            the lofty mountain of the Maleans, then at length, the storm <lb/>
            snatching him away bore him along, mourning greatly, through <lb/>
            the fishy sea, to the extreme part of the country, where <lb/>
            Thyestes before dwelt in his house, but then Ægisthus, son of <lb/>
            Thyestes, dwelt there. But when his return from thence at <lb/>
            length appeared safe, and the gods turned the wind back, and <lb/>
            they came home, he indeed rejoicing stept on his paternal <lb/>
            land, and touching his country kissed it; and many warm <lb/>
            tears were shed by him, as he gladly beheld his land.22 The <lb/>
            spy indeed saw him from a place of look-out, whom crafty- <lb/>
            counselling Ægisthus having led, had seated there ; and he <lb/>
            promised him two talents of gold as a reward. And he watched <lb/>
            for a year, lest coming he [Agamemnon] should escape him, and <lb/>
            be mindful of doughty valour. And he hastened to tell it at the <lb/>
            house of the shepherd of the people ; and AEgisthus immedi­ <lb/>
            ately planned a deceitful stratagem. Having chosen out of <lb/>
            the people twenty of the most excellent men, he set them in <lb/>
            ambush, and elsewhere he ordered a banquet to be prepared. <lb/>
            But he himself went to invite Agamemnon, the shepherd of <lb/>
            the people, with horses and chariots, meditating disgraceful <lb/>
            deeds. Entertaining him at a banquet he led him unawares <lb/>
            to death, and slew him, as if any one has slain an ox at its <lb/>
            manger. Nor was any one left of the companions of the son <lb/>
            of Atreus, who had followed him, nor any one of those of <lb/>
            Ægisthus ; but they were [all] slain in the palace.'</p>
          <p>" Thus he spoke ; but my heart was broken : and sitting on <lb/>
            the sands I wept; nor did my heart desire to live any longer <lb/>
            and behold the light of the sun. But when I was satiated with <lb/>
            weeping, and rolling myself [on the ground], then the unerring <lb/>
            old man of the sea addressed me. ' No longer, O son of Atreus, <lb/>
            weep thus for a long time without ceasing, since we shall not <lb/>
            find any profit from it; but try as quickly as possible, by what <lb/>
            means thou mayest now reach thy paternal land. For thou <lb/>
            wilt either find him23 alive; or Orestes being before-hand <lb/>
            has slain him ; but thou wilt be present at the burial feast.'</p>
          <p>" Thus he spoke. But my heart and noble mind was again <lb/>
            delighted in my breast, although I was sorrowful; and ad- <note type="footnote"> 22 Perhaps Æschylus conceived the beautiful speech of the herald <lb/>
            (Agam. 516, sqq.) from this passage. </note><note type="footnote"> 23 Ægisthus. </note> <pb n="58"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="550-591."/> <lb/>
            dressing him I spoke winged words. ' These indeed I know; <lb/>
            but do thou name the third man, who is still detained alive in <lb/>
            the wide sea [, or dead; for I wish although grieving to <lb/>
            hear].'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; but he answering again addressed me: <lb/>
            'The son of Laertes, who inhabits dwellings in Ithaca: him <lb/>
            I saw in an island, shedding the moist tear, in the palace of <lb/>
            the nymph Calypso, who detains him by necessity; nor is he <lb/>
            able to come to his paternal land: for he has not ships fitted <lb/>
            with oars, and companions who may conduct him over the <lb/>
            wide back of the sea. But for thee, O noble Menelaus, it is <lb/>
            not decreed by the gods to die, and meet with thy fate in <lb/>
            horse-pasturing Argos; but the immortals will send you to <lb/>
            the Elysian plain, and the boundaries of the earth, (where is <lb/>
            auburn-haired Rhadamanthus, there of a truth is the most <lb/>
            easy life for men. There is nor snow, nor long winter, nor <lb/>
            ever a shower, but ever does the ocean send forth the gently <lb/>
            blowing breezes of the west wind, to refresh men ;) because <lb/>
            you possess Helen, and are the son-in-law of Jove.'</p>
          <p>" Thus having spoken, he plunged beneath the billowy sea. <lb/>
            But I went to my ships together with my godlike companions ; <lb/>
            and my heart was troubled much as I went. But when we <lb/>
            came to our ship and to the sea, and prepared supper, and <lb/>
            ambrosial night came on, then we slept on the shore of the <lb/>
            sea. But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, <lb/>
            appeared, first of all we drew our ships into the divine sea, <lb/>
            and placed the masts and sails in the equal ships; and they <lb/>
            embarking sat on the benches, and sitting in order smote the <lb/>
            hoary wave with their oars. And I brought the ships back <lb/>
            to the waters of Egypt, to the river filled by Jove, and I offer­ <lb/>
            ed up perfect hecatombs. But when I had appeased the anger <lb/>
            of the gods who exist for ever, I built a tomb for Agamemnon, <lb/>
            that his renown 24 might be inextinguishable. Having perform­ <lb/>
            ed these things, I returned; for the immortals, who sent me <lb/>
            quickly to my dear country, gave me a prosperous gale. But <lb/>
            come now, remain in my palace until the eleventh or twelfth <lb/>
            day; and then I will send thee [away] well, and will give <lb/>
            thee splendid presents, three horses and a well-polished cha­ <lb/>
            riot ; but furthermore I will give thee a beautiful cup, that <note type="footnote"> 24 " That my fame " !! is the version of the old translator, according to <lb/>
            his usua. taste and judgment. </note> <pb n="59"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="592—625."/> <lb/>
            thou mayest make libations to the immortal gods, mindful of <lb/>
            me all thy days."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " O son of <lb/>
            Atreus, do not now detain me here a long time. For indeed <lb/>
            I could endure to sit with thee for a year, nor would a regret <lb/>
            for home and for my parents possess me; for I am very much <lb/>
            delighted at hearing thy words and discourse. But now my <lb/>
            companions in divine Pylos are wearied ; and thou art detain­ <lb/>
            in- me here for a long time. But let the present, whatever <lb/>
            thou wouldst have given me, be some furniture: for I will <lb/>
            not take horses to Ithaca, but will leave them here as an orna­ <lb/>
            ment for thee; for thou rulest over the wide plain, in which <lb/>
            there is abundance of lotus, and cypress, and wheat, and rye, <lb/>
            and wide-springing white barley. But in Ithaca there are <lb/>
            neither wide courses, nor is there any meadow: it is fit for <lb/>
            feeding goats, although25 it is more pleasant [to mel than [a <lb/>
            land] that pastures horses. For there is not any of the <lb/>
            islands, which are shut up by the sea, fit for driving horses, <lb/>
            or that has good meadows; and above all Ithaca."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but Menelaus strenuous in the din of battle <lb/>
            smiled, and stroken him down by the hand, and spoke and ad­ <lb/>
            dressed him : " Thou art of a good race, my son, such words <lb/>
            dost thou say. Wherefore I will change these things for you ; <lb/>
            for I am able. But of presents, whatever effects lie in my <lb/>
            house, I will give thee that which is most beautiful and most <lb/>
            valuable. I will give thee a wrought cup; and it is all silver, <lb/>
            but the lips are worked with gold. It is the work of Vulcan ; <lb/>
            but the hero Phtedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it, when <lb/>
            his house covered me being about to return from thence ; but <lb/>
            I wish to give this to thee."</p>
          <p>Thus they indeed spoke such things to one another; but <lb/>
            the banqueters had gone to the dwelling of the divine king; <lb/>
            and they led forth sheep, and brought heartening wine; and <lb/>
            their wives with beautiful fillets brought bread for them. <lb/>
            Thus they were arranging about supper in the palace.</p>
          <p>But the suitors before the palace of Ulysses were delighted <note type="footnote"> 23 The explanation of this passage is due to Loewe, who alone has seen <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="626—665."/> <lb/>
            with quoits and hurling small javelins on a worked pavement, <lb/>
            where before they practised their insolence. But Antinous and <lb/>
            godlike Eurymachus, chiefs of the suitors, had sat down, for <lb/>
            they were by far the best in virtue. To them Noemon, son of <lb/>
            Phronius, coming near, inquiring of Antinous with words ad­ <lb/>
            dressed them: " Do we then know any thing in our minds, or <lb/>
            not, O Antinous, when Telemachus returns from sandy Pylos ? <lb/>
            He has gone having taken my ship; but I have need of it, to <lb/>
            pass over to wide-wayed Elis, where I have twelve mares, and <lb/>
            under them untamed mules patient in toil: some one of which <lb/>
            I would by driving subdue."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but they were astonished in their mind ; <lb/>
            for they did not suppose that he was gone to Nelean Pylos, <lb/>
            but was present some where there in the country, or amongst <lb/>
            the sheep, or with the swineherd.</p>
          <p>Antinous, the son of Eupithes, immediately addressed him ; <lb/>
            "Tell me unerringly, where did he go, and what youths chosen <lb/>
            from Ithaca followed him ? Are they his own hired men and <lb/>
            servants ? And could he accomplish this ? And tell me this <lb/>
            truly, that I may know well, whether did he take away thy <lb/>
            black ship by force against thy will, or didst thou give it him <lb/>
            willingly, when he kindly addressed thee with words?"</p>
          <p>But him Noemon, the son of Phronius, addressed in turn : <lb/>
            " I gave it him willingly. What would another do, when such <lb/>
            a man, having cares in his mind, should beg him ? It would <lb/>
            be difficult indeed to deny a gift. But those youths follow <lb/>
            him, who excel amongst us in the people: and I perceived <lb/>
            Mentor, or some god, (but he was in all respects like him,) <lb/>
            embarking as captain. But I marvel at this. I saw divine <lb/>
            Mentor here yesterday in the morning ; but at that time he <lb/>
            embarked in the ship to Pylos." Thus having spoken, he went <lb/>
            to the house of his father. But the noble mind of both 26 of <lb/>
            these was astonished: and the suitors sat together, and ceased <lb/>
            their games. But Antinous, son of Eupithes, grieving, spoke <lb/>
            amongst them ; for his darkened thoughts were very much <lb/>
            filled with rage. and his eyes were like unto shining fire.</p>
          <p>" O gods! a great work indeed has been most daringly <lb/>
            performed, this voyage of Telemachus; we said that it would <lb/>
            not be accomplished by him. Against the will of so many of <lb/>
            us a young boy has gone away at random, having drawn out <note type="footnote"> 28 Antinous and Eurymachus. </note> <pb n="61"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="696-706."/> <lb/>
            a ship, and having chosen out the best amongst the people. <lb/>
            He will begin to be even a further evil; but may Jupiter de­ <lb/>
            stroy his might, before he begets harm for us. But come, <lb/>
            give me a swift ship and twenty companions, that I may lie <lb/>
            in ambush for him, and watch him as he is returning, in the <lb/>
            strait of Ithaca and rugged Samos ; so that to his sorrow he <lb/>
            may sail for the sake of his father."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and they all praised and urged him [to go] : <lb/>
            immediately then rising they went into the house of Ulysses ; <lb/>
            nor was Penelope long without hearing their words, which <lb/>
            the suitors meditated deeply in their minds. For the herald <lb/>
            Medon told it her, who heard their counsels, being outside <lb/>
            the hall; but they had planned their counsel secretly. He <lb/>
            was hastening through the house to tell it to Penelope; but <lb/>
            as he was crossing the threshold Penelope addressed him.</p>
          <p>" O herald, why have the illustrious suitors sent thee for­ <lb/>
            ward ? Is it that thou mayest tell the handmaidens of divine <lb/>
            Ulysses to cease from their employments, and prepare a feast <lb/>
            for them ? Would that, not wooing me, nor keeping com­ <lb/>
            pany any where else, they would now sup here for the last <lb/>
            and most extreme time. Ye who, assembled together, con­ <lb/>
            sume much livelihood, the possession of prudent Telemachus, <lb/>
            have ye not before heard from your fathers, when ye were <lb/>
            children, what a man was Ulysses amongst your parents, <lb/>
            neither treating any one unjustly, nor speaking aught amongst <lb/>
            the people, which is the custom of divine kings; in that one <lb/>
            may hate some mortals, and may love others. But he never <lb/>
            at all treated a man unjustly: but your mind and disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful deeds are apparent, nor is there any gratitude afterwards <lb/>
            for benefits,"</p>
          <p>Medon, acquainted with prudent things, addressed her in <lb/>
            turn: " I would indeed, O queen, this may be the worst evil, <lb/>
            but the suitors are planning another much greater, and more <lb/>
            grievous, which may not the son of Saturn accomplish: they <lb/>
            desire to kill Telemachus with the sharp brass, as he is re­ <lb/>
            turning home; but he has gone for news of his father to <lb/>
            sacred Pylos, and to divine Lacedæmon."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and her knees and heart were loosed; <lb/>
            and speechlessness seized her for a long time: and her eyes <lb/>
            were filled with tears, and her full voice was checked. But <lb/>
            at length answering him with words she addressed him : " O <pb n="62"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="707-747"/> <lb/>
            herald, wherefore is my son gone ? it was not at all necessary <lb/>
            that he should embark on swift ships, which for men are <lb/>
            horses of the sea, and pass over the vast wave ? Is it that his <lb/>
            name may not be left amongst men?"</p>
          <p>Then Medon, acquainted with prudent things, answered <lb/>
            her: “ I know not whether some god excited him, or his own <lb/>
            mind was urged to go to Pylos, that he may inquire of either <lb/>
            the return of his father, or what fate he has drawn on himself."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he departed to the house of Ulysses. <lb/>
            But soul-wasting grief was shed around her, nor did she any <lb/>
            more endure to sit on her seat, although many were in the <lb/>
            house; but she sat on the threshold of her much-laboured <lb/>
            chamber, mourning piteous: and around her all her hand­ <lb/>
            maidens wailed, as many as were in the house, young and <lb/>
            old : Penelope, mourning violently,27 addressed them :</p>
          <p>" Hear me, friends, for Olympus28 has given me grief above <lb/>
            the measure of all those, as many as were brought up and born <lb/>
            with me; I who before indeed have lost my excellent husband, <lb/>
            lion-hearted, adorned amongst the Grecians with all kinds of <lb/>
            virtues, excellent; whose glory is wide throughout Greece <lb/>
            and the middle of Argos. But now the tempests have <lb/>
            snatched away my dear son from the palace, inglorious ; nor <lb/>
            did I hear of his setting out. Wretehed ones, you did not <lb/>
            each of you place it in your mind to raise me from my bed, <lb/>
            knowing clearly in your soul when he embarked on the hollow <lb/>
            black ship. For if I had known that he was setting out on <lb/>
            this voyage, then he should have either remained, although <lb/>
            anxious for his voyage, or should have left me dead in the <lb/>
            palace. But let some trusty servant call old Dolins, my <lb/>
            servant, whom my father gave me on coming hither, and he <lb/>
            keeps my garden that abounds in trees; that as quickly as <lb/>
            possible, sitting by Laertes, he may tell him all these things, <lb/>
            if by chance contriving some counsel in his mind, going out <lb/>
            he may make lamentations amongst the people on account of <lb/>
            those, who desire to destroy his own offspring, and that of <lb/>
            divine Ulysses."</p>
          <p>Her dear nurse Euryclea in answer addressed her: " Dear <lb/>
            mistress, do thou slay me with the cruel steel, or leave me in <lb/>
            the palace ; but I will not by any means conceal the tale. I <note type="footnote"> If Cf. Buttm, Lexil. p. 32, sqq. </note><note type="footnote">28 Le. heaven put for the gods. </note> <pb n="63"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="745—781."/> <lb/>
            knew all these things, and I gave him whatever he com­ <lb/>
            manded, bread and sweet wine; but he received a great oath <lb/>
            from me, that I would not tell thee, before the twelfth day came, <lb/>
            or. thou thyself didst desire me, and hadst heard of his having <lb/>
            set out; so that thou mightest not hurt thy beauteous person <lb/>
            by weeping. But having washed thyself, and putting clean <lb/>
            garments on thy body, ascending to the upper room, with thy <lb/>
            women attendants, pray to Minerva the daughter of Ægis- <lb/>
            bearing Jove: for she will then save him, even from death. <lb/>
            But do not grieve the afflicted old man ; for I do not think <lb/>
            that the race of the son of Arcesius29 is altogether hated by <lb/>
            the blessed gods: but some one will survive, who shall pos­ <lb/>
            sess the lofty-roofed houses, and the rich fields afar."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke ; and laid her grief to sleep, and restrained <lb/>
            her eyes from grief. But she, having washed herself, and <lb/>
            putting clean garments on her body, ascended to the upper <lb/>
            room with her women attendants: and she put cakes in a <lb/>
            basket, and prayed to Minerva. " Hear me, thou daughter <lb/>
            of Ægis-bearing Jove, unsubdued, if ever much-counselling <lb/>
            Ulysses has burnt in his palace the fat thighs of an ox or a <lb/>
            sheep, of these, I pray thee, be mindful now, and save my <lb/>
            dear son, and ward off the suitors who are wickedly over­ <lb/>
            bearing.”</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken she lamented ; but the goddess heard <lb/>
            her prayer. And the suitors were making a tumult in the <lb/>
            shaded palace ; and thus some one of the over-bearing youths <lb/>
            spoke : " In truth the much-wooed queen is preparing nuptials <lb/>
            for us ; nor kens she at all that slaughter is devised for her <lb/>
            son." Thus some one said ; but they knew not these things, <lb/>
            how they were destined. But Antinous harangued and ad­ <lb/>
            dressed them:</p>
          <p>" Sirs, avoid all vaunting words entirely, lest by chance <lb/>
            some one may tell them even within. But come, standing up <lb/>
            thus in silence, let us accomplish our design, which even now <lb/>
            has pleased us all in our breasts."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he chose twenty of the best men ; and <lb/>
            they hastened to the swift ship and the shore of the sea. First <lb/>
            of all they drew the ship into the deep of the sea : and placed <lb/>
            a mast and sails in the black ship: and fitted the oars to the <note type="footnote"> Laertes was the son of Arcesius, sun of Jupiter. </note> <pb n="64"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="782-818."/> <lb/>
            leather thongs, [all things rightly: and above they spread <lb/>
            out the white sails.] And the high-minded servants brought <lb/>
            arms for them, and they moored it 30 on high in the moist sea; <lb/>
            and they themselves embarked, and there they took supper, <lb/>
            and waited till evening came on.</p>
          <p>But prudent Penelope, having ascended to the upper room, <lb/>
            by without taking food, without taking any thing to eat or <lb/>
            drink, meditating whether her blameless son would escape death, <lb/>
            or whether he would be subdued by the overbearing suitors. <lb/>
            But as many things as a lion is wont to meditate in a crowd of <lb/>
            men, fearing, when they bring the deceitful circle around him ; <lb/>
            upon her meditating so many things sweet sleep fell: and she <lb/>
            slept reclining ; and all her limbs were relaxed. Then the blue- <lb/>
            eyed goddess Minerva thought of other things ; she made an <lb/>
            image, and it was like in its body to the lady Iphthima, the <lb/>
            daughter of magnanimous Iearius ; whom Eumelus, who in­ <lb/>
            habits a house in Pheræ, had married. And she sent her to <lb/>
            the house of divine Ulysses ; if she could by any means make <lb/>
            Penelope, mourning and grieving, cease from her wailing <lb/>
            and tearful grief. But she entered the chamber near the <lb/>
            thong of the bolt, and she stood over her head and addressed <lb/>
            her in words.</p>
          <p>" Art thou sleeping, Penelope, sorrowing in thy dear heart ? <lb/>
            the gods who live easily by no means suffer thee to weep, nor <lb/>
            to be sad, since thy son is still about to return; for he is not <lb/>
            at all a sinner against the gods."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Penelope answered, sleeping very sweetly <lb/>
            at the gates of dreams:31 “ Why, my sister, hast thou come <lb/>
            hither ? for before thou hast not visited me, since thou dost <lb/>
            inhabit a house very far off: and thou exhortest me to cease <lb/>
            from my toil, and the many pains which irritate me in my <lb/>
            mind and breast: I who before lost my excellent husband, <lb/>
            lion-hearted, adorned amongst the Grecians with all kinds of <lb/>
            virtues, excellent; whose glory is wide throughout Greece <lb/>

            thee."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Penelope addressed in turn: "If indeed <lb/>
            thou art a goddess, and hast heard the voice of a goddess, <lb/>
            come tell me of him in a sea calamitous,32 whether he is still <lb/>

            dead, and in the dwellings of Pluto."</p>
          <p>The obscure image answering addressed her : "I will not <lb/>
            tell thee of him altogether, whether he is alive or dead, but it <lb/>
            is base to speak vain things." Having thus spoken, she van­ <lb/>

          <p>Jupiter despatches Mercury to the island of Ca <unclear>ypso</unclear>, commanding her to <lb/>
            send Ulysses away ; which she consents to with reluctance: and gives him <lb/>
            materials to form a raft. On the eighteenth day after he had set out <lb/>
            Neptune sees him, and raises a great storm, which destroys his raft. <lb/>
            Having undergone great danger, by the assistance of a sea-nymph, who <lb/>
            gives him a scarf to support himself with, he arrives safe on shore at <lb/>
            Phæacia.</p>
          <p>AURORA rose from her bed beside illustrious Tithonus,1 that <lb/>
            she might bear light to immortals and men: but the gods <lb/>
            sat in conclave, and amongst them Jupiter, who thunders <lb/>
            from on high, and whose power is greatest. To them Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva related the many toils of Ulysses, remembering [him]; <lb/>
            for he was her care, when in the house of the Nymph.</p>
          <p>" O father Jove, and ye other blessed gods who exist for ever, <lb/>
            let no sceptre-bearing king be any more provident, mild, and <lb/>
            gentle, nor thinking rightful things in his mind, but let him <lb/>
            ever be severe and do unlawful things ; since no one of the <lb/>
            people, over whom he reigned, is mindful of divine Ulysses, <lb/>
            and he was mild as a father: but he lies in an island suffer­ <lb/>
            ing great grief, in the palace of the Nymph Calypso, who de­ <lb/>
            tains him by necessity; and he is unable to come to his pa­ <lb/>
            ternal land. For there are not ships for him fitted with oars, <lb/>
            and companions who may conduct him over the wide back of <lb/>
            the sea. Now again they desire to slay his beloved son, about <lb/>
            to return home; but he has gone to divine Pylos and mighty <lb/>
            Lacedæmon2 for news for his father."</p>
          <p>But her, cloud-collecting Jove addressed in answer: “My <lb/>
            child what word has escaped thy lips? For hast thou not <lb/>
            indeed thyself devised this plan, that Ulysses may indeed <lb/>
            return and be revenged on them ? But do thou skilfully con­ <lb/>
            duct Telemachus, for thou art able, that he may reach his <lb/>
            paternal land unhurt; but let the suitors return back3 in their <lb/>

          <p>He spoke and addressed his beloved son Mercury: “Mer­ <lb/>
            cury, for thou art a messenger also in other things, tell 4 our <lb/>
            unerring decree to the fair-haired Nymph, the return of tho <lb/>
            patient Ulysses, that he may go back, neither under the guidance. <lb/>
            of the gods, nor of mortal men, but let him come on the twen­ <lb/>
            tieth day to fertile Scheria5 on a raft lashed together with <lb/>
            many chains, having suffered calamities, to the land of the Phæ­ <lb/>
            acians, who are nearly related6 to the gods; who will honour <lb/>
            him in their heart, like as a god, and will send him in a ship <lb/>
            to his dear paternal land, giving him abundance of brass and <lb/>
            gold, and raiment, so many things as Ulysses would never <lb/>
            have taken from Troy, even if he had returned unharmed, <lb/>
            having been allotted his share of booty. For so it is fated <lb/>
            for him to behold his friends, and return to his lofty-roofed <lb/>
            house, and his own paternal land."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; nor did the messenger, the slayer of Argus, <lb/>
            disobey him. Immediately then he bound his beautiful sail <lb/>
            dais beneath his feet, ambrosial, golden ; which carried him <lb/>
            both over the moist wave,7 and over the boundless earth, <lb/>
            with the breath of the wind. And he took the rod with <lb/>
            which he soothes the eyes of men, whom he wishes, and <lb/>
            again rouses those who are asleep. Holding this in his <lb/>
            hands, the strong slayer of Argus flew, and going over Pieria, <lb/>
            he descended from the air into the sea. Then he rushed over <lb/>
            the wave like a bird, a sea-gull, which hunting for fish in the <lb/>
            terrible bays of the barren sea, dips frequently its wings <lb/>
            in the brine; like unto this Mercury rode over many waves. <lb/>
            But when he came to the distant island, then going from the <lb/>
            blue sea, he went to the continent; until he came to the great <lb/>
            cave in which the fair-haired Nymph dwelt; and he found <lb/>
            her within. A large fire was burning on the hearth, and at <lb/>
            a distance the smell of well-cleft cedar, and of frankincense,8 <note type="footnote"> 4 But see Loewe on i. 292. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Corcyra, anciently called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ Δρεπάνη</foreign>, now Corfu. </note><note type="footnote"> 6Their kings were said to be the third in descent from Neptune.

            that were burning, shed odour through the island: but she <lb/>
            within was singing with a beautiful voice, and going over9 the <lb/>
            web, wove with a golden shuttle. But a flourishing wood <lb/>
            sprung up around her grot, alder and poplar, and sweet-smell­ <lb/>
            in- cypress. There also birds with spreading wings slept, owls <lb/>
            and hawks, and wide-tongued crows of the ocean, to which <lb/>
            maritime employments are a care. There a vine in its prime <lb/>
            was spread about the hollow grot, and it flourished with <lb/>
            clusters. But four fountains flowed in succession with white <lb/>
            water, turned near one another each in different ways; but <lb/>
            around there flourished soft meadows of violets, and of pars­ <lb/>
            ley. There indeed even an immortal coming would admire <lb/>
            it when he beheld, and would be delighted in his mind ; <lb/>
            there the messenger, the slayer of Argus, standing, admired. <lb/>
            But when he had admired all things in his mind, he immedi­ <lb/>
            ately came to the wide cave; nor was Calypso, divine one of <lb/>
            goddesses, when she saw him before her, ignorant who he was. <lb/>
            (For the immortal gods are not unknown to one another, even <lb/>
            if any one inhabits dwellings at a distance.) But he did not <lb/>
            find magnanimous Ulysses within. For he was weeping, <lb/>
            seated on the shore, where before wasting his mind with tears, <lb/>
            and groans, and griefs, he used to look o'er the barren sea, <lb/>
            pouring forth tears. But Calypso, divine one of goddesses, <lb/>
            sitting on her shining, brilliant throne, inquired of Mercury :</p>
          <p>" Why hast thou come unto me, O Mercury, with a golden <lb/>
            rod, thou who art revered and beloved ? hitherto thou dost <lb/>
            not visit me often. Tell me of what thou art thinking; for <lb/>
            my mind exhorts me to perform it, if at least I can accom­ <lb/>
            plish it, and if it is to be performed. But follow onward, that <lb/>
            I may place before thee the rites of hospitality."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, the goddess set near him a table, <lb/>
            having filled it with ambrosia; and mixed ruby10 nectar, <lb/>
            But the messenger Mercury drank and ate. But when he <lb/>
            had supped and refreshed his mind with food, then answer­ <lb/>
            ing her with words he addressed her:</p>
          <p>" Dost thou, who art a goddess, ask me a god who am come ? <note type="footnote"> Hill. Eustathins and Hesychius (cf. Alberti, T. it. p. 1746) merely say <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="96-141."/> <lb/>
            but I will relate to you my word unerringly; for thou biddest <lb/>
            me. Jupiter commanded me to come here against my will. For <lb/>
            who would willingly run through so much salt water, immense <lb/>
            as it is? nor is there any city near of mortals, who offer up <lb/>
            to the gods sacrifices and chosen hecatombs. But indeed it <lb/>
            is not possible that any other god should either transgress the <lb/>
            will of Ægis-bearing Jupiter, or make it vain. He says that <lb/>
            there is a man with thee, the most in calamity of all the men <lb/>
            who fought for nine years about the city of Priam, and in the <lb/>
            tenth, having destroyed the city, went home; but on their <lb/>
            return they sinned against Minerva, who stirred up an evil <lb/>
            wind and mighty waves against them. Then all the others, <lb/>
            his excellent companions, perished, but him the wind and the <lb/>
            wave carrying drove hither; he now commands thee to send <lb/>
            him away as quickly as possible. For it is not the destiny <lb/>
            for him to perish here at a distance from his friends, but it it <lb/>
            still his destiny to behold his friends, and to reach his lofty- <lb/>
            roofed house, and his own paternal land."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke. But Calypso, divine one of goddesses, shud­ <lb/>
            dered. and addressing him spoke winged words: " Severe are <lb/>
            ye gods, envious above others, who grudge that goddesses <lb/>
            should sleep openly with men, if any one has made for <lb/>
            herself a dear husband. As when rosy-fingered Aurora took <lb/>
            Orion, so long you gods who live easily envied her, until in <lb/>
            Ortygia chaste Diana of the golden throne slew him, attacking <lb/>
            him with her mild weapons; and as when fair-haired Ceres, <lb/>
            yielding to her passion, was united in love and in the couch <lb/>
            with Jasion, in thrice-ploughed fallow land ; nor was Jupiter <lb/>
            a lone time without knowing it, who slew him, striking him <lb/>
            with his white thunder. So now you gods grudge that a mortal <lb/>
            man should be present with me, whom I indeed saved when <lb/>
            going alone on the keel of a ship; when Jupiter striking his <lb/>
            swift ship with white thunder, cleft it in the middle of the <lb/>
            dark sea. [Then all the others, his excellent companions, <lb/>
            perished, but him the wind and the wave carrying, drove <lb/>
            hither:] him indeed I loved and nourished, and I said that I <lb/>
            would make him immortal and free from old age all his days. <lb/>
            But since it is not possible that any other god should either <lb/>
            transgress the will of Ægis-bcarillg Jove or make it vain, let <lb/>
            him go over the barren sea, if he excites and commands him; <lb/>
            but I will not send him any where: for I have not ships <pb n="70"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="141-178"/> <lb/>
            equipped with oars, and companions, who may conduct him <lb/>
            over the wide back of the sea. But I will prudently suggest <lb/>
            it to him, nor will I conceal it, that he may by all means <lb/>
            reach his paternal land unharmed."</p>
          <p>And her the messenger Mercury addressed in turn : " So now <lb/>
            send him away, and look to the wrath of Jupiter, lest perhaps <lb/>
            hereafter angry he should be harsh to thee."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, the stout slayer of Argus departed. But <lb/>
            the venerable Nymph went to strong-hearted Ulysses, when <lb/>
            she had heard the messages of Jupiter. But she found him <lb/>
            sitting on the shore; nor were his eyes ever dried from <lb/>
            tears, but his pleasant life was wasted away, as he bewailed <lb/>
            his return, since it did not please the Nymph.11 But during <lb/>
            the nights indeed he slept even by necessity in the hollow <lb/>
            eaves, against his will, near her who was willing; but during <lb/>
            the day sitting on the rocks and shores, [wasting his mind <lb/>
            with tears, and mournings, and griefs,] he looked over the <lb/>
            barren sea, pouring forth tears; but the divine one of god­ <lb/>
            desses standing near addressed him :</p>
          <p>" Ill-fated one, do not lament here any longer, nor let thy <lb/>
            life waste away; for now I will readily send thee away. But <lb/>
            come, having cut long planks, join together a wide raft with <lb/>
            brass, but fix ribs 12 upon it on high, that it may carry thee <lb/>
            over the shadowy set. But I will put in it bread and water, <lb/>
            and red wine giving strength, which may ward off hunger from <lb/>
            thee. And I will put garments about thee; and I will send <lb/>
            a prosperous gale from behind, that thou mayest come un­ <lb/>
            scathed to thy paternal land, if at least the gods who possess <lb/>
            the wide heaven are willing, who are better than me, both to <lb/>
            plan and to determine."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke; but then much-enduring divine Ulysses <lb/>
            shuddered, and addressing her spoke winged words : " Thou, <lb/>
            indeed, O goddess, art planning something else, nor by any <lb/>
            means my voyage, thou who biddest me pass over the great <lb/>
            gulf of the sea, terrible and difficult, on a raft; but not even <lb/>
            swift equal ships can pass over this, rejoicing in the pros­ <lb/>
            perous gale of Jove. Nor would I embark on a raft against <lb/>
            thy will, unless thou, who art a goddess, wouldst endure to <note type="footnote"> 11 That he should return. </note><note type="footnote"> 12 The upright beams of the ship, supporting the upper decks </note> <pb n="71"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="178S-216"/> <lb/>
            swear to me a great oath, that thou wilt not plan any other <lb/>
            evil calamity against me."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but Calypso, the divine one of goddesses, <lb/>
            smiled, and laid hold of him by the hand and spoke and said : <lb/>
            "Thou art mistaken,13 and yet art thou acquainted with <lb/>
            cunning things ! what a word is this thou hast thought to <lb/>
            speak ! Now let earth and wide heaven above know this, <lb/>
            and the water which is poured from Styx, (which is the <lb/>
            greatest and most terrible oath to the immortal gods,) that I <lb/>
            will not devise any other evil calamity against thee. But I <lb/>
            devise and consider the things, which for myself I should take <lb/>
            care of, should such a necessity come upon me. For my in­ <lb/>
            tention is proper, nor is my mind in my breast of steel, but <lb/>
            of pity."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, the divine one of goddesses quickly <lb/>
            led the way ; and he went immediately after the footsteps of <lb/>
            the goddess, and the goddess and the man came to the hollow <lb/>
            cave ; and he sat there on the throne from whence Mercury <lb/>
            rose: and the Nymph set near him all kinds of food, to eat <lb/>
            and drink, such as mortal men eat: and she herself sat oppo­ <lb/>
            site divine Ulysses, and near her the handmaids placed am­ <lb/>
            brosia and nectar, and they stretched forth their hands to the <lb/>
            food lying ready before them. But when they were satiated <lb/>
            with eating and drinking, Calypso, divine one of goddesses, <lb/>
            began speaking to them :</p>
          <p>" O noble son of Laertes, crafty Ulysses, so now dost thou <lb/>
            wish to go immediately to thy dear paternal land ? but how­ <lb/>
            ever14 be happy. If indeed thou knewest in thy mind, how <lb/>
            many cares it is fated for thee to fill up, before thou comest to <lb/>
            thy paternal land, certainly thou wouldst remain here and <lb/>
            guard my house, and thou wouldst be immortal; although <lb/>
            thou art anxious to see thy wife, of whom thou art ever de­ <lb/>
            sirous all thy days. I do not indeed consider myself to be <lb/>
            inferior to her, either in person or nature, since it is by no <lb/>
            means fit that mortal women should contend with immortals <lb/>
            in person and form."</p>
          <p>But her the crafty Ulysses in answer addressed : " O sacred <lb/>
            goddess, do not be angry with me on this account ; for I my­ <lb/>
            telf know very well, that the prudent Penelope is inferior <note type="footnote"> " Ironically. </note><note type="footnote"> 14 TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμπης ἐν τούτψ̃ τψ τοπψ ὄμως σημαίνει</foreign>. Schol. </note> <pb n="72"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="217- 252."/> <lb/>
            to thee in form, and in stature, to look at; for she is mortal, <lb/>
            but thou art immortal and free from old age: but even so I <lb/>
            wish and desire all my days, both to go home and behold the <lb/>
            day of my return. But if any one of the gods breaks me down <lb/>
            on the dark sea, I will endure it, having a patient mind in my <lb/>
            breast; for I have already suffered very many things, and <lb/>
            have endured many toils in the waves and in war; and let <lb/>
            this happen after these." 15</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but the sun set, and darkness came on ; <lb/>
            they then going to the recess of the hollow cave, were de­ <lb/>
            lighted with love, remaining near to each other.</p>
          <p>But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, ap­ <lb/>
            peared, Ulysses immediately put on a cloak and a garment, <lb/>
            and the Nymph herself put on a large white veil, thin and <lb/>
            graceful, but around her loins she placed a beauteous golden <lb/>
            girdle; and she placed a head-dress on her head : and then <lb/>
            she prepared the voyage 16 for the strong-hearted Ulysses. <lb/>
            She gave him a large axe, fitted to his hands, of steel sharpened <lb/>
            on both sides : and with it a very beautiful handle, of olive <lb/>
            wood, well fitted to it: then she gave him a well-polished <lb/>
            adze ; and she led the way to the extreme part of the island, <lb/>
            where tall trees sprung up, alder, and poplar, and there was <lb/>
            pine reaching to heaven, long since seasoned, very dry, which <lb/>
            would sail lightly for him. But when she had shown where <lb/>
            the tall trees had sprung up, Calypso, divine one of goddesses, <lb/>
            returned to the house ; but he began to cut17 the wood, and <lb/>
            his work was quickly performed. And he felled twenty in <lb/>
            all, and cut them with the steel, and polished them skilfully, <lb/>
            and directed them by a rule. In the mean time Calypso, di­ <lb/>
            vine one of goddesses, brought augers, and he then perforated <lb/>
            all, and fitted them to one another: and he fixed it with pegs <lb/>
            and cramps. As large a bottom of a wide ship of burden, as <lb/>
            any man, who was well-skilled in workmanship, would mark <lb/>
            out, so large did Ulysses make the wide raft. And erecting <lb/>
            the ribs, fixing them with many beams,18 he made it, and <note type="footnote"> 15i. e. quum illa mala jam toleraverim, facile etiam hoc tolerabo ma­ <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="253-288."/> <lb/>
            finished it with long decks.19 And he made a mast in it, and <lb/>
            a sail-yard fitted to it; and he made a rudder besides that he <lb/>
            might guide it. And he dammed it all round with willow <lb/>
            wicker-work, to be a defence against the wave; and he <lb/>
            heaped much ballast20 upon it. But in the mean time Ca­ <lb/>
            lypso, divine one of goddesses, brought linen for making sails; <lb/>
            and he contrived these also well: and he bound in it upper <lb/>
            ropes,21 cables, and sheets.22 And then he drew it into the <lb/>
            divine sea with levers. It was the fourth day, and all things <lb/>
            were finished for him ; on the fifth then divine Calypso sent <lb/>
            him from the island, having clad him in perfumed garments, <lb/>
            and having washed him. And the goddess placed in it for <lb/>
            him one skin of black wine, and another large one of water ; <lb/>
            and provisions in a wallet, and in it many strength-recruiting <lb/>
            dainties : and she sent a harmless and favourable wind forward. <lb/>
            And divine Ulysses gladly spread his sails to the prosperous <lb/>
            gale ; but sitting down he guided it skilfully with the rudder ; <lb/>
            nor did sleep fall upon his eye-brows, as he contemplated both <lb/>
            the Pleiads, and setting Bootes, and the Bear, which they also <lb/>
            call by name the Wain, which turns itself in the same place, <lb/>
            and observes Orion ; but it alone does not share in the washing <lb/>
            of the ocean. For Calypso, divine one of goddesses, had com­ <lb/>
            manded him to pass over the sea, keeping to the left hand. <lb/>
            Seventeen days indeed he sailed, passing over the sea, but in <lb/>
            the eighteenth the shadowy mountains of the land of the <lb/>
            Phræcians appeared, where it was nearest for him; but it ap­ <lb/>
            peared as a shield in the dark sea.</p>
          <p>The powerful Shaker of the earth,23 as he was returning <lb/>
            from the Ethiopians, beheld him from a distance from the <lb/>
            mountains of the Solymi; for he was seen by him sailing over <lb/>
            the sea; but he was very wrathful in his heart; and moving <lb/>
            his head he spoke [thus] to his own mind:</p>
          <p>" O gods, certainly indeed the deities have now consulted <lb/>
            differently about Ulysses, when I was amongst the Ethiopi­ <lb/>
            ans ; and now he is near the land of the Phæacians, where <note type="footnote"> 19 More literally, "plankings, floorings," <foreign xml:lang="grc">σανίδες ἐ</foreign>к <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱώϱας εἰς πϱὐμναν <lb/>

            there is destiny for him to escape the great limit of misery, <lb/>
            which befalls him : but still I think that he willundergo <lb/>
            enough of calamity."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he collected the clouds, and disturbed <lb/>
            the sea, taking his trident in his hands; and stirred up all <lb/>
            the storms of all kinds of winds ; and he with clouds covered <lb/>
            the earth and the sea at the same time ; and night arose from <lb/>
            heaven. And the South-east and the South rushed together, <lb/>
            and the hard-blowing West, and the cold-producing North, <lb/>
            rolling the mighty wave. And then the knees and the dear <lb/>
            heart of Ulysses were loosed, and sorrowing he said to his <lb/>
            strong-hearted mind:</p>
          <p>" Alas me, wretched one that I am ! what will become of <lb/>
            me at length ? I fear, lest indeed the goddess has told all <lb/>
            things unerringly, who said that I should accomplish toils by <lb/>
            sea, before I reached my paternal land ; all these things are cer­ <lb/>
            tainly now brought to pass. With what clouds does Jupiter <lb/>
            crown the wide heaven ! and [how] he has troubled the sea ! <lb/>
            and the tempests of all manner of winds hasten on ; now bitter <lb/>
            destruction is certain for me. Thrice and four times blessed <lb/>
            are the Grecians, who formerly perished in spacious Troy, gra­ <lb/>
            tifying the sons of Atreus ! How I would that I had died and <lb/>
            drawn fate upon myself in that day, when many Trojans <lb/>
            hurled their brazen spears about the son of Peleus, who was <lb/>
            dead. Then I should have obtained by lot funeral rites, and <lb/>
            the Grecians would have celebrated my renown. But now it <lb/>
            is destined for me to be seized by a miserable death."</p>
          <p>As he was speaking thus, a mighty wave from the top <lb/>
            thrust him on, rushing terribly upon him, and whirled round <lb/>
            the raft. And he himself fell at a distance from the raft, and <lb/>
            let go the rudder from his hands; and a terrible storm of the <lb/>
            winds mixed together coming upon it broke the middle of his <lb/>
            mast. And the sail and the yard-arm fell at a distance in the <lb/>
            sea, and kept him a long time under the wave: nor was he <lb/>
            able to hold himself up immediately, from the rush of the <lb/>
            great wave; for the garments which divine Calypso had <lb/>
            given him were heavy; late, however, he came up, and <lb/>
            vomited the bitter brine from his mouth, which trickled in <lb/>
            abundance from his head. But not even thus was he forget- <note type="footnote"> 24 " A vertice pontus," Virgo CEn. i. 118. Loewe makes it equivalent <lb/>
            to desuper, or rather, to funditus. </note> <pb n="75"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="324—359."/> <lb/>
            ful of the raft, although afflicted, but rushing through the <lb/>
            waves, lie seized hold of it; and sat in the middle avoiding <lb/>
            the verge of death. But a great wave carried it here and <lb/>
            there through the stream. And as when the autumnal North <lb/>
            wind carries thorns over the plain, but they are held close to <lb/>
            one another; so the winds carried it here and there through <lb/>
            the sea. Sometimes the South wind threw it forward to the <lb/>
            North to carry, sometimes again the East wind gave it up to <lb/>
            the West to pursue. But him fair-footed Ino Leucothoe, <lb/>
            who was previously a mortal that had speech,25 but now in the <lb/>
            main of the set had a share in the honour of the gods, the <lb/>
            daughter of Cadmus, saw ; she indeed pitied wandering Ulys­ <lb/>
            ses, undergoing toils, and like unto a cormorant in flight, she <lb/>
            came up from the deep; and she sat on the raft bound with <lb/>
            many chains, and addressed him:</p>
          <p>" O ill-fated one, why is the earth-shaking Neptune so <lb/>
            violently wrath with thee, that he produces many evils for <lb/>
            thee ? He will not however destroy thee, although very <lb/>
            anxious to do so. But do thus, (for thou seemest to me not <lb/>
            to be unwise,) having put off these garments, leave thy raft <lb/>
            to the winds to carry; but swimming with thine hands seek <lb/>
            for your return to the land of the Phæacians, where there is <lb/>
            destiny for thee to escape. And take26 this head-gear, which <lb/>
            is immortal, and spread it under thy breast; then there is no <lb/>
            fear that thou wilt suffer any thing, or perish. But when <lb/>
            thou hast reached the shore with thine hands, taking it off <lb/>
            again throw it into the dark sea, far from the continent, and <lb/>
            do thou turn thyself away at a distance."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, the goddess gave him the scarf, and <lb/>
            she, like unto a diver, again went under the billowing sea: <lb/>
            and the black wave covered her. But much-enduring, divine <lb/>
            Ulysses, hesitated, and mourning spoke to his strong-hearted <lb/>
            mind:</p>
          <p>" Woe is me ! does not some one of the immortals contrive <lb/>
            again a deceit against me, since she orders me to go from <lb/>
            the raft. But however I will by no means obey her ; since <lb/>
            at a distance with my eyes I beheld the land, where she said <note type="footnote"> 25 i. e. capable of speaking after the manner of mankind.

            I must escape. But thus will I do, and it seems to me to be <lb/>
            the best; as long as the planks are firm in the cramps, so long <lb/>
            will I remain here, and will endure to suffer toils. But when <lb/>
            indeed the wave has shaken my raft to pieces, I will swim'; <lb/>
            since it is not in my power to devise any thing better."</p>
          <p>While he meditated these things in his breast and in his <lb/>
            mind, earth-shaking Neptune raised a. mighty wave against <lb/>
            him, terrible, severe and lofty,27 and drove him. But as a <lb/>
            violently blowing wind shakes a heap of dry chaff, which it <lb/>
            scatters in different places; so it scattered its 28 long planks. <lb/>
            But Ulysses mounted on one plank, driving it on as a single <lb/>
            horse, and he put off the garments, which divine Calypso had <lb/>
            given him. And he immediately spread the scarf under his <lb/>
            breast; and he fell prone into the sea, stretching out his hands, <lb/>
            seeking to swim; but king Neptune saw him, and shaking <lb/>
            his head, spoke to his own mind :</p>
          <p>" Thus now wander over the sea, suffering many evils, <lb/>
            until thou art mixed with Jove-nurtured men, but not even <lb/>
            so do I think that thou wilt make little of thy toil."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he scourged his beautiful-haired <lb/>
            horses, and came to Ægas. where are his illustrious palaces. <lb/>
            But Minerva, the daughter of Jove, meditated other things ; <lb/>
            for she bound the courses of the other winds, and commanded <lb/>
            all of them to cease, and be laid to sleep: but she roused the <lb/>
            nimble North, and broke the waves before, until that noble <lb/>
            Ulysses should be mixed with the oar-loving Phæacians, <lb/>
            having avoided death and the Fate. Here he wandered tw o <lb/>
            nights and two days on the compact29 (not broken) wave ; and <lb/>
            his heart often saw death before his eyes. But when at length <lb/>
            fair-haired Aurora completed the third day, then indeed the <lb/>
            wind ceased, and there was a breathless calm ; and he saw the <lb/>
            land near, looking very sharply forward, being lifted aloft by <lb/>
            a great wave. As when the life of a father appears welcome <lb/>
            to his children, who lies in a disease suffering severe pain, <lb/>
            wasting away a long time, and a hateful deity has grazed near <lb/>
            upon him ; and the gods have freed him welcome from his evil <note type="footnote"> 27 Literally, " lofty-roofed," i. e. covering as with a roof every thing <lb/>

            plight; so welcome did the earth and wood appear to Ulysses ; <lb/>
            and he swam, hastening to step on the main-land with his <lb/>
            feet; but when he was so far distant as one is heard shouting <lb/>
            out, then he heard the noise of the sea against the rocks; for <lb/>
            the mighty surge bursting terribly roared against the dry <lb/>
            [coast] of the continent; and all things were rolled over with <lb/>
            the foam of the sea; for there were not havens to contain <lb/>
            ships, nor places of shelter,30 but the shores were prominent, <lb/>
            and there were crags and rocks. Then the knees and dear <lb/>
            heart of Ulysses fainted, and mourning he spake unto his <lb/>
            strong-hearted mind:</p>
          <p>" Alas for me ! since Jupiter has granted me to behold the <lb/>
            unexpected land, and I indeed have passed over this wave, <lb/>
            having cut through it, there has appeared no where any egress <lb/>
            but of the hoary sea ; for without there are sharp rocks, and a <lb/>
            dashing surge rages around, and a smooth cliff runs up, and <lb/>
            near it the sea is deep ; and it is not possible to stand on both <lb/>
            my feet, and to escape an evil plight, lest by chance a mighty <lb/>
            billow snatching me, as I am going out, dash me against a <lb/>
            stony cliff, and my attempt be vain. But if I shall swim <lb/>
            still farther, in case I may some where find sloping shores, <lb/>
            and ports of the sea, I am afraid, lest the storm snatching me <lb/>
            again should bear me to the fishy sea, mourning sadly, or even <lb/>
            the deity should send a mighty whale against me from the <lb/>
            sea, such as illustrious Amphitrite nourishes in great num­ <lb/>
            bers : for I know how illustrious Neptune is enraged against <lb/>
            me."</p>
          <p>Whilst he meditated these things in his breast and in his <lb/>
            mind, in the mean time a mighty billow bore him to the <lb/>
            rough shore. There his skin would have been lacerated, and <lb/>
            his bones fractured, had not the blue-eyed goddess Minerva <lb/>
            prompted his mind; and rushing on, he seized hold of a rock <lb/>
            with both his hands, which he held groaning, until the great <lb/>
            billow had passed by. And this he thus avoided ; but the <lb/>
            returning wave rushing upon him, struck him again, and cast <lb/>
            him far out into the sea. As when many stones hold to the <lb/>
            claws of a polypus drawn out of its bed, so was the skin torn <lb/>
            from his strong hand against the rocks : and a mighty billow <lb/>
            covered him.</p>
          <p>There at length unhappy Ulysses would have perished con­ <note type="footnote"> ac SciL against the wind. </note> <pb n="78"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="437—470"/> <lb/>
            trary to his fate, had not blue-eyed Minerva given him pru­ <lb/>
            dence ; coming up from out of the wave, where it vomits out <lb/>
            against the shore, he swam beyond, looking to the land, if he <lb/>
            could any where find sloping shores, and ports of the sea. <lb/>
            But when he came swimming to the mouth of a beautiful <lb/>
            flowing river, where it seemed to him to be the best place, <lb/>
            smooth from rocks, and there was a shelter from the wind; <lb/>
            he knew that it was flowing forward, and he prayed in his <lb/>
            mind :</p>
          <p>" Hear me, O King, whoever thou art; for unto thee who <lb/>
            art much wished for I come, flying from the threats of Nep­ <lb/>
            tune, from the sea. He indeed is revered even by the immor­ <lb/>
            tal gods, whoever of men comes wandering, as I now do, to thy <lb/>
            stream, and come to thy knees, having suffered many things. <lb/>
            But take pity, O King: I profess to be thy suppliant."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but he 31 immediately stopped his stream, <lb/>
            and restrained the wave; and made a calm before him ; and <lb/>
            preserved him to the mouth of the river; but he bent both <lb/>
            his knees, and his sturdy hands; for his heart was overcome <lb/>
            by the sea. But he was swollen over all his body, and the <lb/>
            sea came forth in quantities through his mouth and his nos­ <lb/>
            trils : and he lay breathless and speechless, with his strength <lb/>
            wasted, and terrible fatigue came upon him. But when he re­ <lb/>
            covered his breath, and his mind was collected in his breast, <lb/>
            then he loosed from him the scarf of the goddess; and he cast <lb/>
            it into the river flowing into the sea, and a great wave car­ <lb/>
            ried it back through the stream ; and Ino immediately re­ <lb/>
            ceived it in her dear hands ; but he going away from the <lb/>
            river reclined amongst the bulrush, and kissed the bounteous <lb/>
            earth ; and mourning spake unto his strong-hearted mind:</p>
          <p>" Alas for me, what shall I suffer? What will at length <lb/>
            become of me ? If I shall watch through the severe night <lb/>
            in a river, [I fear,] lest the evil rime, and the prolific <lb/>
            dew together, overcome my worn-out mind, on account of <lb/>
            my weakness ; for the breeze blows chill from a river in <lb/>
            the morning.32 But if I should go up to the hill and shady <note type="footnote"> 31 i. e. the river god. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> So Dan e, l'urgat. xxiv. <lb/>

            the cold and weariness should leave me, and sweet sleep come <lb/>
            upon me, I fear that I should be a booty and prey for wild <lb/>
            beasts."</p>
          <p>So then it seemed to him to be better as he considered: <lb/>
            then he hastened to the wood; and found it near the water <lb/>
            in a conspicuous place, and he came under two shrubs, which <lb/>
            sprang from the same place; one of wild olive, the other of <lb/>
            olive. Neither the strength of the moistly blowing winds <lb/>
            breathes through them, nor has the shining sun ever struck <lb/>
            them with its beams, nor has the shower penetrated entirely <lb/>
            through them: so thick were they grown entangled with one <lb/>
            another ; under which Ulysses came. But he immediately <lb/>
            heaped up a wide bed with his hands; for there were great <lb/>
            numbers of leaves spread about, as many as would shelter <lb/>
            either two or three men in the winter season ; although it <lb/>
            were very severe. The much-enduring divine Ulysses on seeing <lb/>
            it rejoiced, and he lay down in the middle of it, and heaped a <lb/>
            heap of leaves over himself; and as when any one has hidden <lb/>
            a torch in black ashes, at the extremity of a farm, which has <lb/>
            not any other neighbours, preserving the seed of the fire, that <lb/>
            he may not have to light it from any where else; so Ulysses <lb/>
            covered himself with leaves ; and over his eyes Minerva shed <lb/>
            sleep, that site might as soon as possible cause him to cease <lb/>
            his laborious toil, having covered around his dear eyelids.</p>

          <p>Minerva appears to Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinous, in a dream, and <lb/>
            desires her to go to the river to wash her clothes, since she should shortly <lb/>
            be married. After she has done washing, her attendants and herself begin <lb/>
            to play; Ulysses, sleeping in a wood hard by, is awakened by the noise, <lb/>
            and, coming out, begs of Nausicaa to supply him with food and clothing: <lb/>

            with sleep and with toil; but Minerva went to the people and <note type="footnote"> I Loewe follows Thiersch. Gk. Gr. p. 489, 24, in deriving <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρημένος</foreign> <lb/>

            city of the Phæacians; who formerly indeed dwelt in wide <lb/>
            Hypereia, near the Cyclops, overbearing men, who injured <lb/>
            them, and were superior in strength. Godlike Nausithous <lb/>
            removing them led them from thence, and settled them in <lb/>
            Scheria far away from enterprising men ; and he drew a wall <lb/>
            around the city, and built houses, and made temples for the <lb/>
            gods, and divided the plains. But he already subdued by <lb/>
            Fate had gone to Orcus ; but Alcinous then ruled, experienced <lb/>
            in counsels from the gods. The blue-eyed goddess Minerva <lb/>
            went to his house, to plan the return of strong-hearted Ulysses. <lb/>
            And she hastened to a much-variegated chamber, in which <lb/>
            by a damsel, like unto the immortals in nature and form, <lb/>
            Nausicaa, daughter of strong-hearted Alcinous; and near her <lb/>
            two handmaids, possessing beauty from the graces, on each <lb/>
            side of the portals; and there were shining doors upon them. <lb/>
            But she, like as a breath of wind, rushed into the chamber of <lb/>
            the damsel, and stood above her head, and addressed her, <lb/>
            likened unto the daughter of Dymas, a famous sailor, who was <lb/>
            her equal in age, and was pleasing to her mind; likened unto <lb/>
            her, blue-eyed Minerva addressed her:</p>
          <p>" Nausicaa, why has thy mother brought thee forth thus <lb/>
            careless ? For thy splendid garments lie neglected, but thy <lb/>
            marriage is near, when it is fit that thou shouldst put on <lb/>
            beautiful garments thyself, and shouldst give some to others, <lb/>
            who will conduct thee. For from these things a good report <lb/>
            goes up amongst men; and a father and venerable mother <lb/>
            rejoice. But let us go to wash them together with the dawn <lb/>
            of morning, and I will follow as thine assistant, that thou <lb/>
            mayest prepare them as quick as possible; since thou wilt <lb/>
            not be yet a long time a virgin. For now the chiefs amongst <lb/>
            the people of all the Phæacians woo thee, where also is thine <lb/>
            own race. But come, incite thy illustrious sire early in the <lb/>
            morning to prepare mules and a chariot, which may carry thy <lb/>
            girdles, and garments, and splendid cloaks: for thus it will <lb/>
            be much more honourable for thee than to go on foot; for the <lb/>
            places for washing are far distant from the city."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, blue-eyed Minerva departed to Olym­ <lb/>
            pus, where they say is for ever the firm seat of the gods, it is <note type="footnote"> bore ; and with the strengthening a, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀ</foreign>f<foreign xml:lang="grc">αϱημένος, ἀαϱημένος</foreign>,)<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀϱημένος</foreign> <lb/>

            shower, nor does the snow approach it: but a most cloudless <lb/>
            serenity is spread out; and white splendour runs over it; in <lb/>
            which the blessed gods are delighted all their days. To this <lb/>
            place Minerva departed, when she had admonished the damsel.</p>
          <p>Immediately the beautiful-throned morning came, which <lb/>
            roused well-clad Nausicaa; but she marvelled at her dream. <lb/>
            And she hastened through the house, that she might tell it <lb/>
            to her parents, her dear father and mother; and she found <lb/>
            them within. Her mother was sitting upon the hearth with <lb/>
            her female attendants turning her sea-purpled threads [of <lb/>
            wool] ; but her father she met at the door, going to the <lb/>
            illustrious princes, to a council, where the noble Phæacians <lb/>
            had invited him. She therefore, standing very near, ad­ <lb/>
            dressed her dear father :</p>
          <p>" My dear father, wouldst thou prepare3 a lofty chariot <lb/>
            with good wheels for me, that I may take my beautiful gar­ <lb/>
            ments to the river to wash them, which lie begrimed ? And <lb/>
            it is fit for thee thyself, when going amongst the chiefs, to <lb/>
            consult counsels, having clean garments on thy body; and <lb/>
            five dear sons are born to thee in thy palace, of whom two are <lb/>
            married, but three unmarried, in the bloom of life: but they <lb/>
            always desire to go to the dance having their garments fresh <lb/>
            washed; and all these things are a care to my mind."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke; for she was ashamed to mention to her <lb/>
            dear father her blooming marriage; but he understood all, <lb/>
            and answered her with words: " I grudge thee not the mules, <lb/>
            my child, nor any thing else; go, and the servants shall pre­ <lb/>
            pare for thee a lofty, well-wheeled chariot, fitted with a <lb/>
            covering."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he commanded the servants ; and they <lb/>
            obeyed. They without prepared the swift chariot drawn by <lb/>
            mules, and led the mules under, and yoked them under the <lb/>
            chariot; and the damsel brought out her beautiful shining <lb/>
            vesture from the chamber, and placed it in the well-wrought <note type="footnote"> 2 These verses are splendidly expressed by Lucret. iii. 18. <lb/>

            charlot: and her mother put varied food, grateful to the <lb/>
            mind, in a chest, and she put in it dainties, and poured wine <lb/>
            into a flagon of goat-skin; and the damsel mounted the cha­ <lb/>
            riot ; and she4 gave to her5 moist oil in a golden cruse, that <lb/>
            site might anoint herself with her women attendants, And <lb/>
            she took the whip, and the beautiful reins, and lashed [the <lb/>
            mules] that they might go on; and there was a noise of the <lb/>
            mules : for they were on the stretch without ceasing : and they <lb/>
            carried the garments and her, not alone; [for] other hand <lb/>
            maidens also went with her.</p>
          <p>When they had now reached the most beautiful stream of <lb/>
            the river, where were continual places for washing, and much <lb/>
            beautiful water flowed out, [enough] even to cleanse very filthy <lb/>
            things: there they loosed the mules from under the chariot, <lb/>
            and drove them close to the eddying river, that they might <lb/>
            eat the sweet grass; but they took the garments out of the <lb/>
            chariot with their hands, and put them into the black water; <lb/>
            and they trod them in the cisterns, quickly showing rivalry. <lb/>
            But when they had washed and cleared all the filth, they <lb/>
            spread them in order on the shore of the sea, where the wave <lb/>
            most washed the stones to the beach. And having washed and <lb/>
            anointed themselves with the smooth oil, they then took their <lb/>
            meal near the banks of the river: but they waited for their <lb/>
            garments to be dried by the beams of the sun. But when her <lb/>
            handmaidens and herself were satiated with food, they played <lb/>
            at ball, having thrown off their head-dresses; and white-armed <lb/>
            Nausieaa began the song for them. Such as Diana6 who re­ <lb/>
            joices in the bow, traverses over the mountain, either lofty <lb/>

            site is [eminent] above all by her head and her forehead, for <lb/>
            she is easily known, but all of them are fair: so this chaste <lb/>
            virgin excelled amongst her handmaidens. But when they <lb/>

            his mind.</p>
          <p>" Woe is me, into the land of what mortals am I now come ? <lb/>
            Are they violent and wild, and not just? Or are they <lb/>
            hospitable, and have they a holy mind ? Since a female <lb/>
            voice of damsel nymphs, who possess the lofty summits of the <lb/>
            mountains, and the fountains of the rivers, and the grassy <lb/>
            marshes, has come around me; or am I by chance near men <lb/>
            who possess the power of speech ? But come, I myself will <lb/>
            try, and see."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, divine Ulysses went from under the <lb/>
            thickets; and with his strong hand he broke a branch of <lb/>
            leaves from the thick wood, that he might cover the unseemly <lb/>
            parts of a man around his body. And he hastened, like as a <lb/>
            lion nourished in the mountains, trusting in his might, that <lb/>
            goes rained and blown upon; and his eyes burn ; and he <lb/>
            comes after oxen, or sheep, or the wild stags; for hunger <lb/>
            commands him to enter even a close abode to make an <lb/>
            attempt upon the flocks: thus Ulysses, although naked, was <lb/>
            about to mingle with the fair-haired damsels ; for necessity <lb/>
            came upon him. But he appeared dreadful to them, being <lb/>
            defiled by the brine; and they fled in terror each in differ­ <lb/>
            ent ways through the projecting shores. But the daughter of <lb/>
            Alcinous alone remained ; for Minerva put confidence in her <lb/>
            mind, and took fear from her limbs; and she stood keeping <lb/>
            herself before him. But Ulysses meditated, whether taking <lb/>
            hold of her knees he should supplicate the beautiful damsel, <lb/>
            or as he was standing at a distance should beseech her with <lb/>
            mild words, if she would show him the city, and give him <lb/>
            garments. So, indeed, as he considered, it seemed to him to be <lb/>
            better, standing at a distance, to beseech her with mild words, <lb/>
            lest the damsel should be wrath with him in her mind, taking <lb/>
            hold of her knees. Forthwith he spoke a mild and crafty <lb/>
            word:</p>
          <p>" I supplicate thee, C queen ; whether thou art some god <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <pb n="84"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="150—190"/> <lb/>
            dess, or a mortal; if indeed thou art some goddess <unclear>f</unclear> those <lb/>
            who possess the wide heaven, I consider thee most like unto <lb/>
            Diana, the daughter of mighty Jove, in form, stature, and <lb/>
            nature ; but if thou art some one of mortals who dwell on the <lb/>
            earth, thrice blessed thy sire and venerable mother, and thrice <lb/>
            blessed thy brothers; much I ween their mind is ever de­ <lb/>
            lighted with joy on account of thee, when they behold such a <lb/>
            branch entering the dance. He moreover is above others <lb/>
            most blessed in his heart, who shall lead thee home, having <lb/>
            loaded himself with bridal gifts. For never have I seen such <lb/>
            a mortal with my eyes, either man or woman; a reverential <lb/>
            feeling possesses me as I look upon thee. Lately I saw such <lb/>
            a young shoot of a palm growing up in Delos, near the altar <lb/>
            of Apollo: for I came thither, and much people followed <lb/>
            me on that journey, which was about to produce evil cares <lb/>
            for me: in the same manner also when I beheld that, I was <lb/>
            a long time astonished in my mind; for never had such a <lb/>
            tree sprung up from the earth. So I admire and am astonish­ <lb/>
            ed at thee, O lady, and I fear very much to touch thy knees. <lb/>
            But hard grief comes upon me. Yesterday in the twentieth <lb/>
            day I escaped from the black set ; for a long time the <lb/>
            wave and the swift storms continually carried me from the <lb/>
            island Ogygia; but now the deity has cast me here, that <lb/>
            I may still perhaps suffer evil even here; for I do not think <lb/>
            that it will cease; but even before this the gods accomplish <lb/>
            many things. But do thou, O queen, pity me, for having <lb/>
            suffered many miseries, I come to thee first; but I know no <lb/>
            one of the other human beings who possess this city and land. <lb/>
            Show me the city, and give me an old garment to put on, <lb/>
            if by chance coming here thou hast the wrapping of old gar­ <lb/>
            ments. But may the gods grant thee as many things as thou <lb/>
            desirest in thy mind, a husband, and house, and excellent <lb/>
            concord may they grant; for there is not any thing more ex­ <lb/>
            cellent and better than this, than when a husband and wife, <lb/>
            agreeing in their counsels, manage a house; [causing] many <lb/>
            griefs to their enemies, and joys to their well-wishers; and <lb/>
            they themselves particularly are sensible of it."</p>
          <p>But him white-armed Nausicaa answered in turn: " O <lb/>
            stranger, since tou art not like unto a worthless or foolish <lb/>
            man, and Olympian Jove himself distributes happiness to men <lb/>
            good or bad, to each as he chooses ; and perhaps he has given <pb n="85"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="190—226."/> <lb/>
            these things to thee, but however it is fit that thou shouldst <lb/>
            endure them. But now, since thou comest to our city and <lb/>
            land, thou shalt neither be in want of clothing, nor any thing <lb/>
            else of the things which are fit for a suppliant from afar7 who <lb/>
            meets here. And I will show thee the city, and will tell thee <lb/>
            the name of the people. The Phæacians possess this city and <lb/>
            land ; but I am the daughter of strong-hearted Alcinous, on <lb/>
            whom the strength and might of the Phæacians depends."</p>
          <p>She spoke, and gave order to her fair-haired handmaidens: <lb/>
            " Stop, I pray you, handmaidens; whither are ye flying, <lb/>
            when ye behold a man ? whether do you think that he is some <lb/>
            one of hostile men ? There is not that man a living mortal, <lb/>
            nor could there be, who would come to the land of the Phæa­ <lb/>
            cians, bringing hostility: for we are very dear to the immor­ <lb/>
            tals ; and we dwell at a distance, the farthest in the sea of <lb/>
            many waves, nor does any other of mortals mingle with us. <lb/>
            But this one comes here, some wretched wanderer, whom <lb/>
            now it is fit to take care of: for all strangers and beggars are <lb/>
            from Jove; and even a little gift is grateful. But, O hand­ <lb/>
            maidens, give meat and drink to the stranger: and wash him <lb/>
            in the river where there is a shelter from the wind."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke, but they stood and commanded one an­ <lb/>
            other: and then they placed Ulysses under shelter, as Nau­ <lb/>
            sicaa, the daughter of strong-hearted Alcinous, bade them ; and <lb/>
            near him they placed a mantle and tunic and garments ; and <lb/>
            they gave him liquid oil in a golden cruse, and they desired <lb/>
            him to wash himself in the streams of the river. Then, in­ <lb/>
            deed, Ulysses addressed the handmaidens : " O handmaidens, <lb/>
            stand at a distance thus, until I myself shall wash the brine <lb/>
            from my shoulders, and shall anoint them around with oil; <lb/>
            for ointment has been a long time away from my body; but <lb/>
            I will not wash before you; for I am ashamed to be naked, <lb/>
            being come amongst fair-haired damsels."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, and they went to a distance and told it to <lb/>
            the virgin. But divine Ulysses washed away the brine, <lb/>
            which surrounded his back and wide shoulders, from his body <unclear/> <lb/>
            In the river; and from his head he wiped off the froth of the <lb/>
            arren sea. <note type="footnote"> 7 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταλαπείριος, ἀντί του̃ ξένος, καὶ πόῤῥωθεν πεπεϱακώς, ῆ</foreign> <unclear>μακϱθεν</unclear> <lb/>

          <p>But when he had washed himself all over, and anointed <lb/>
            himself with oil, and had put on the garments which the <unclear/> <lb/>
            chste virgins gave him ; Minerva, born of Jove, made him <lb/>
            greater and stouter to behold: and from his head she made <lb/>
            his hair curled, like unto a hyacinthine8 flower. As when <lb/>
            some skilful man, whom Vulcan and Pallas Minerva have <lb/>
            instructed in a cunning art, pours gold round silver, and per­ <lb/>
            forms beautiful works; so ste shed grace on his head and <lb/>
            shoulders. Then, going to a distance, he sat down on the <lb/>
            shore of the sea, shining with beauty and gracefulness; and <lb/>
            the virgin admiring beheld him ; then she spoke [thus] to the <lb/>
            fair-haired handmaidens :</p>
          <p>" Listen to me, ye white-armed handmaidens, whilst I shall <lb/>
            say something. This man does not come amongst the god­ <lb/>
            like Phæacians, against the will of all the gods who possess <lb/>
            the wide heaven. For he before appeared to me to be un­ <lb/>
            seemly, but now he is like unto the gods, who possess the wide <lb/>
            heaven. I wish such a one might be called my husband, <lb/>
            dwelling here, and it might please him to remain here. But, <lb/>
            O handmaidens, give to the stranger meat and drink."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke, and they heard her, and immediately <lb/>
            obeyed, and near Ulysses they placed meat and drink. Much- <lb/>
            enduring divine Ulysses indeed drank and eat greedily; for <lb/>
            he had been a long time without tasting food. But white- <lb/>
            armed Nausicaa thought upon other things; having folded <lb/>
            the garments, site placed them on the beautiful chariot, and <lb/>
            yoked the solid-hoofed mules; and she herself mounted it; <lb/>
            and she encouraged Ulysses, and spoke and said:</p>
          <p>“ Rise now, O stranger, to go to the city, that I may con­ <lb/>
            duct thee to the house of my prudent sire, where I think that <lb/>
            thou wilt see as many as are the chief of all the Phæacians. <lb/>
            But by all means do thus, for thou seemest to me not to be <lb/>
            without understanding ; whilst we go through the fields and <lb/>
            the tillage of men, so long do thou come quickly with the <lb/>
            handmaidens, after the mules and chariot: and I will lead <lb/>
            the way. But when we shall go up to the city, around which <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Imitated by Milton, P. L. iv. 300 : <lb/>
            " His fair large front and eye sublime declared <lb/>
            Absolute rule ; and hyacinthine locks <lb/>
            Hound from his parted forelock manly hung <lb/>
            Clustering.” </note> <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n=" 229—301."/> <lb/>
            there is a lofty turret, and a fair port on each side of the city, <lb/>
            and a narrow entrance; and on the way the ships rowed on <lb/>
            both sides are drawn up ; for in each there is a station for all; <lb/>
            and there is their forum, around the beautiful temple of Nep­ <lb/>
            tune, fitted with large9 stones dug out of the earth. There <lb/>
            they take care of the tackle of the black ships, the ropes, and <lb/>
            the cables, and they sharpen the oars. For neither the bow <lb/>
            nor the quiver are a care to the Phæacians, but masts and <lb/>
            oars of ships, and the equal ships, rejoicing in which, they <lb/>
            pass over the hoary sea. Their harsh report I shun, lest <lb/>
            some one should blame me behind my back ; for they are very <lb/>
            overbearing amongst the people. And perchance some worse <lb/>
            one meeting us would say, ' Who is this handsome and portly <lb/>
            stranger who follows Nausieaa? where did she find him ? will <lb/>
            lie now indeed be her husband ? She has either brought <lb/>
            from her own ship some one of men from a far country who <lb/>
            was wandering ; for there are none near. Or some much­ <lb/>
            prayed-for god, descending from heaven, has come to her at her <lb/>
            entreaty ; and she will have him all her days. It were better for <lb/>
            her, if she herself had, departing, found a husband elsewhere ; <lb/>
            for she despises these Phæacians amongst the people, who <lb/>
            woo her, numerous and excellent.' So they will say, and <lb/>
            these things would be reproaches against me: but I should <lb/>
            be indignant with another, who should do such things, who <lb/>
            should have intercourse with men against the will of her dear <lb/>
            father and mother still alive, before her nuptials came openly. <lb/>
            Do thou, O stranger, thus attend to my word, that thou mayest <lb/>
            as quickly as possible obtain a conduct and return from my <lb/>
            father. We shall find a beautiful grove of Minerva, near the <lb/>
            way of poplars : and in it a fountain flows, and round it there is <lb/>
            a meadow. There is the allotted estate10 of my father, and the <lb/>
            flourishing orchard, so far from the city as one shouting out <lb/>
            makes [others] hear ; sit down there and wait for some time, <lb/>
            until we come to the city and reach the house of my father. <lb/>
            But when thou thinkest that we have come to the house, then <lb/>
            go to the city of the Phæacians, and inquire for the house of <lb/>
            my strong-hearted father, Alcinous. But it is easily known, <lb/>
            and even a boy would lead thee: for the houses of the <note type="footnote"> 9 Literally, " drawn stones," for they were so large that it was neces­ <lb/>

            Phæacians are not made like it, such is the house of the hero <lb/>
            Alcinous. But when the house and the hall conceal thee, <lb/>
            go very quickly through the palace, until thou comest to my <lb/>
            mother: but she sits on the hearth in the beam of the fire, turn­ <lb/>
            ing the sea-purple threads of wool, wondrous to behold, reclin­ <lb/>
            ing against a pillar, and her handmaidens sit behind her. There <lb/>
            the throne of my father is reclined near her; in this he sitting, <lb/>
            as an immortal, drinks wine; passing by him, place thine hands <lb/>
            upon the knees of my mother, that rejoicing thou mayest be­ <lb/>
            hold the day of thy return, quickly, although thou art very <lb/>
            far off. If indeed she shall be kindly disposed in her mind, <lb/>
            then there is a hope that thou wilt see thy friends, and come <lb/>
            to thy well-built house, and to thy paternal land."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, she lashed the mules with the shining <lb/>
            scourge, and they quickly left the streams of the river : they <lb/>
            ran well, and curvetted briskly with their feet. She also <lb/>
            drove well, in order that the handmaidens and Ulysses might <lb/>
            follow together on foot; and she threw the lash with skill. <lb/>
            And the sun set, and they came to the illustrious grove, <lb/>
            sacred to Minerva, where divine Ulysses sat down: then he <lb/>
            immediately prayed to the daughter of mighty Jove :</p>
          <p>" Hear me, O thou unsubdued daughter of Ægis-bearing <lb/>
            Jove, now at length listen to me, since thou hast never before <lb/>
            listened to me being shipwrecked, when illustrious Neptune <lb/>
            shipwrecked me. Grant that I may come friendly and an <lb/>
            object of pity to the Phæacians.”</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke praying, but Pallas Minerva heard him ; <lb/>
            but she did not yet appear before him; for she had an awe of <lb/>
            her father's brother;11 for he was vehemently wrathful <unclear>witl</unclear> <lb/>

          <p>Nausicaa reaches the city ; but Ulysses on his way thither is met by Minerva, <lb/>
            who shows him the house of Alcinous ; arriving at which, he throws him­ <lb/>
            self at the feet of Arete, the wife of Alcinous, and entreats her to send him <lb/>
            home to his own country. Alcinous bids him rise, and gives him food to <lb/>
            eat. But Arete, recognising his garments, inquires of him whence he got <lb/>
            them : upon which he relates the history of his voyage and wreck, and his <lb/>
            meeting with Nausicaa.</p>
          <p>THUS then much-enduring divine Ulysses prayed there, but <lb/>
            the strength of the mules carried the damsel to the city. <lb/>
            But when she at length arrived at the illustrious house of her <lb/>
            father, she then stood in the portico ; and her brothers stood <lb/>
            around her, like unto the immortals; and they loosed the <lb/>
            mules from the chariot, and carried her garments within. <lb/>
            But she herself went to her chamber; and for her an old <lb/>
            woman of Epirus lighted a fire, the chambermaid Euryme­ <lb/>
            dusa, whom formerly ships rowed on both sides brought from <lb/>
            Epirus; but they chose her out as a prize for Alcinous, be­ <lb/>
            cause he was ruler over all the Phæacians, and the people <lb/>
            listened to him, as to a god; who nurtured white-armed <lb/>
            Nausicaa in the palace ; and who kindled her fire, and set out <lb/>
            supper within. And then Ulysses started to go towards the <lb/>
            city, and Minerva, having a friendly disposition towards <lb/>
            Ulysses, shed much darkness around him, lest any one of the <lb/>
            high-minded Phæacians, meeting him, should both reproach <lb/>
            him with words, and inquire of him who he was. But when <lb/>
            lie was about to enter the lovely city, then the blue-eyed god­ <lb/>
            dess Minerva met him, likened unto a virgin young woman <lb/>
            bearing a pitcher; and she stood before him, and divine <lb/>
            Ulysses inquired of her:</p>
          <p>" O child, couldst thou not lead me to the house of the <lb/>
            man Alcinous, who reigns amongst these men ? For I am <unclear/> <lb/>

          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva addressed in turn : <lb/>
            “ I will show thee then, O father stranger, the house which <lb/>
            thou desirest me; since he dwells near my illustrious sire <lb/>
            But go thus in silence; and I will lead the way. Nor do <lb/>
            thou look at, nor inquire of any man; for they do not easily <lb/>
            tolerate strange men, nor loving one who comes from else <lb/>
            where, do they receive him in a friendly manner. Trusting <lb/>
            in their swift ships, they pass over the mighty gulf, since <lb/>
            Neptune has granted that to them ; their ships are swift as a <lb/>
            bird or a thought.”4</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, Pallas Minerva quickly led the way ; <lb/>
            but he went immediately after the steps of the goddess. But <lb/>
            the sea-famed Phæacians did not perceive him coming through <lb/>
            the city amongst them: for fair-haired Minerva did not per­ <lb/>
            iit them, shrewd goddess, who indeed shed a divine cloud <lb/>
            about him, counselling kind things in her mind. But Ulysses <lb/>
            marvelled at the havens and the equal ships, and the forms of <lb/>
            the heroes themselves, and the long walls, lofty, fitted with <lb/>
            stakes, a wonder to behold. But when they came to the il­ <lb/>
            lustrious palace of the king, the blue-eyed goddess Minerva <lb/>
            began to address him :5</p>
          <p>“ This then, O father stranger, is the house which thou <lb/>
            badest me show thee; and thou wilt find the Jove-nurtured <lb/>
            kings banqueting at a feast: but do thou go within, nor fear <lb/>
            at all in thy mind; for a bold man is better in all affairs, <lb/>
            even if he comes from some where else. First, indeed, thou <lb/>
            wilt find the queen in the palace, and her surname is Arete: <lb/>
            and she is from the same ancestors who gave birth to king <lb/>
            Alcinous. Nausithoüs first earth-shaking Neptune begat, <lb/>
            and Peribæa, in form the finest of women, youngest daughter <lb/>
            of strong-hearted Eurymedon, who formerly reigned over the <lb/>
            haughty giants: but he destroyed the impious people, and <note type="footnote"> the similar use of the word in other passages. So also Oppian. ii. 151, <lb/>

            and begat a strong-hearted son, Nansithoiis, who reigned <lb/>
            amongst the Phæacians. But Nausithoüs begat Hexenor and <lb/>
            Alcinous. The former silver-bowed Apollo smote, being <lb/>
            without male offspring, a bridegroom in the palace, leaving <lb/>
            only one daughter, Arete: but her Alcinous made his wife, <lb/>
            and honoured her as no other [woman] is honoured on the <lb/>
            earth, whatsoever women at least now keep house under hus­ <lb/>
            bands. as she has been honoured in heart and is still, both by <lb/>
            her dear children and by Alcinous himself, and the people, <lb/>
            who, looking upon her as a goddess, welcome her with words, <lb/>
            when she goes through the city. For she herself is by no <lb/>
            means in want of good understanding, and she settles disputes <lb/>
            amongst men, to whom she wishes well. If then indeed she <lb/>
            shall be kindly disposed towards thee in her mind, there is a <lb/>
            hope for thee hereafter to behold thy friends, and come to thy <lb/>
            lofty-roofed house, and thine own paternal land."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, blue-eyed Minerva departed over the <lb/>
            barren sea; and left lovely Scheria : and she came to Mara­ <lb/>
            thon, and wide-stretched Athens, and she entered the compact <lb/>
            house of Erectheus. But Ulysses went to the illustrious dwell­ <lb/>
            ings of Alcinous ; and his heart meditated many things, as he <lb/>
            stood before he arrived at the brazen threshold: for it was as <lb/>
            the shining of the sun or moon, through the lofty-roofed house <lb/>
            of strong-hearted Alcinous. For brazen walls were firmly <lb/>
            built6 each way, to the recess from the threshold ; and around <lb/>
            it a cornice of blue colour; and golden doors enclosed the firm <lb/>
            house within ; and silver pillars stood on the brazen thres­ <lb/>
            hold, and there was a silver lintel over it, and a golden ring.7 <lb/>
            And on each side there were golden and silver dogs, which <lb/>
            Vulcan made with his skilful mind, to guard the house of mag­ <lb/>
            nanimous Alcinous, being immortal8 and free from old age <lb/>
            all their days. But within thrones were firmly set here and <lb/>
            there around the wall, throughout, from the threshold to the <lb/>
            recess: there were thrown over them slender well-woven <lb/>
            mantles, the works of women. Here the leaders of the Phæa- <note type="footnote"> 6 The reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϱηϱέξατ</foreign>’ for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐληλάξα</foreign>-’ is now fully established. See <lb/>

            cians sat drinking and eating; for they held it all the year. <lb/>
            But golden youths stood upon the well-built pedestals, hold­ <lb/>
            ing in their hands burning torches, which shone during the <lb/>
            night to the banqueters through the house. And there were <lb/>
            fifty women servants in the house ; some grind apple-coloured <lb/>
            corn in the mill, others weave the webs, and whirl the <lb/>
            spindles as they sit, like as the leaves of a tall poplar; and <lb/>
            moist oil drips from the well-woven linen. As much as the <lb/>
            Phæacians are skilled above all men to guide a swift ship in <lb/>
            the sea, so are the women in weaving the web: for Minerva <lb/>
            granted them exceedingly to be acquainted with beautiful <lb/>
            works, and [endowed them with] a good understanding. But <lb/>
            without the hall there is a large garden, near the gates, of <lb/>
            four acres; but around it a hedge was extended on both sides. <lb/>
            And there tall flourishing trees grew, pears, and pome­ <lb/>
            granates, and apple-trees producing beautiful fruit, and sweet <lb/>
            figs, and flourishing olives. Of these the fruit never perishes, <lb/>
            nor does it fail in winter or summer, lasting throughout the <lb/>
            whole year; but the west wind ever blowing makes some bud <lb/>
            forth, and ripens others. Pear grows old after pear, apple <lb/>
            after apple, grape also after grape, and fig after fig. There a <lb/>
            fruitful vineyard was planted: one part of this ground, ex­ <lb/>
            posed to the sun in a wide place, is dried by the sun ; and some <lb/>
            [grapes] they are gathering, and others they are treading, and <lb/>
            further on are unripe grapes, having thrown off the flower, and <lb/>
            others are slightly changing colour. And there are all kinds of <lb/>
            beds laid out in order to the furthest part of the ground, flourish <lb/>
            in,,, throughout the whole year: and in it are two fountains, <lb/>
            one is spread through the whole garden, but the other on the <lb/>
            other side goes under the threshold of the hall to the lofty <lb/>
            house, from whence the citizens are wont to draw water. Such <lb/>
            indeed were the glorious gifts of the gods in the house of <lb/>
            Alcinous. There much-enduring divine Ulysses standing <lb/>
            admired it. But when he had admired all things in his mind, <lb/>
            he quickly passed over the threshold within the house. And <lb/>
            he found the leaders and chieftains of the Phæacians making <lb/>
            libations in their cups to the watchful Argus-slayer, to whom <lb/>
            they last made libations, when they were thinking of bed. But <lb/>
            much-enduring divine Ulysses went through the house, hav - <lb/>
            ing a heavy mist, which Minerva shed around him, until he <lb/>
            came to Arete and king Alcinous, when Ulysses threw hit <pb n="93"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="143—180."/> <lb/>
            hands around the knees of Arete. And then indeed the di­ <lb/>
            vine mist was again dispersed from him. But they became <lb/>
            speechless in the house on beholding the man, and <unclear>seeing</unclear> <lb/>
            him they marvelled; and Ulysses besought her:</p>
          <p>“ O Arete, daughter of godlike Rexenor, I come to thy <lb/>
            husband and to thy knees, having gone through many toils, <lb/>
            and to these guests, to whom may the gods grant to live <lb/>
            happily, and may each hand down to his children the posses­ <lb/>
            sions in his palace, and whatever honour the people has given <lb/>
            him. But for me prepare ye an escort, that I quickly reach <lb/>
            my paternal land; since for a long time I suffer griefs away <lb/>
            from my friends."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he sat down on the hearth in the dust <lb/>
            near the fire; but they were all speechless in silence. At <lb/>
            length however the aged hero Echeneus addressed them, who <lb/>
            was the oldest of the Phræacians, and surpassed in speaking, <lb/>
            being acquainted with both many and ancient things. He, <lb/>
            thinking well, harangued and addressed them :</p>
          <p>" O Alcinous, this is not more honourable9 for thee, nor is it <lb/>
            seemly, that a stranger should sit on the ground on the hearth <lb/>
            in the dust; but these restrain themselves, awaiting thy com­ <lb/>
            mand. But come now, raise up the stranger and set him <lb/>
            on a silver-studded throne ; and do thou command the heralds <lb/>
            to mix additional wine, that we may make libations to thun­ <lb/>
            der-rejoicing Jove, who attends venerable suppliants: but <lb/>
            let the housekeeper give a meal to the stranger from the <lb/>
            things that are within."</p>
          <p>And forthwith when the sacred might of Alcinous10 heard <lb/>
            this, taking the prudent Ulysses, cunning in counsel, by the <lb/>
            hand, he raised him from the hearth, and set him on a shining <lb/>
            throne, removing his son, Laodamas beloved of men, who sat <lb/>
            near him, and loved him especially. And a handmaiden bring­ <lb/>
            ing water in a beautiful golden ewer, to wash in, poured it over <lb/>
            a silver cauldron ; and near him she spread a polished table: <lb/>
            and the venerable housekeeper, bringing food, placed it near <lb/>
            him, putting upon it many dainties, gratifying him out of the <lb/>
            means present: but much-enduring divine Ulysses drank and <lb/>
            eat. And then the mighty Alcinous addressed the herald:</p>
          <p>" O Pontonous, having mixed a cup, distribute wine to all <note type="footnote"> 9 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάλλιον</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign> </note><note type="footnote">10 See my note on ii. 409. </note> <pb n="94"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="181—214."/> <lb/>
            throughout the palace, that we may make libations to thunder- <lb/>
            rejoicing Jove, and who attends upon venerable suppliants."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and Pontonous mixed the grateful wine; <lb/>
            and distributed to all, having first begun with the cups." But <lb/>
            when they had made libations, and drunk as much as their <lb/>
            mind wished, Alcinous harangued and addressed them:</p>
          <p>" Hear me, ye leaders and rulers over the Phæacians, that <lb/>
            I may speak the things which my mind commands me in my <lb/>
            breast. Now, indeed, having feasted ye may go home and <lb/>
            sleep; but in the morning convoking more old men, we will <lb/>
            entertain the stranger in the palace, and will offer fitting <lb/>
            sacrifices to the gods: and afterwards we will be mindful of <lb/>
            his escort, that the stranger may return rejoicing to his own <lb/>
            paternal land without labour and affliction under our escort, <lb/>
            quickly, although he is very far off: nor in the mean time <lb/>
            may he suffer any evil and calamity, before he steps upon <lb/>
            his own land. There then he will suffer whatever things Fate <lb/>
            and the heavy Destinies spun with the thread for him at his <lb/>
            birth, when his mother brought him forth. But if any one <lb/>
            indeed of the immortals has come from heaven, then this is <lb/>
            something else which the gods are contriving: for always <lb/>
            hitherto the gods appear manifest unto us, when we offer up <lb/>
            illustrious hecatombs, and they feast sitting with us where we <lb/>
            are. But if even any traveller going alone has met them, <lb/>
            they by no means conceal themselves; since we are close unto <lb/>
            them, like as the Cyclops 12 and the savage tribes of Giants <lb/>
            [are like one another]."</p>
          <p>But him the much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " O Alcinous, let something else be a care in thy mind; for <lb/>
            1 am not like unto the immortals, who possess the wide hea­ <lb/>
            ven, either in my person or my nature, but unto mortal men, <lb/>
            whomever of mankind thou knowest especially enduring toil; <lb/>
            to these indeed I should liken myself in my griefs : and I could <lb/>
            relate to you even more evils, all the labours indeed which I <lb/>
            have suffered by the will of the gods. But permit me, al­ <note type="footnote"> i. e. having first made the due libations. </note><note type="footnote"> 12 The Scholiast explains the passage thus: " We resemble the gods in <lb/>
            righteousness as much as the Cyclops and Giants resembled each other in <lb/>
            impiety. But in this sense of it there is something intricate and contrary <lb/>
            to Homer's manner. We have seen that they derived themselves from <lb/>
            Neptune, which sufficiently justifies the above interpretation." Cowper. <lb/>
            I have followed the Scholiast, with Loewe. </note> <pb n="95"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="215—243."/> <lb/>
            though grieved, to take my supper. For there is not any <lb/>
            thing more shameless at the time of a hateful belly,13 which <lb/>
            commands one to be mindful of itself by its necessity, although <lb/>
            one is much afflicted, and has grief in one's mind. Thus too <lb/>
            I indeed have grief in my mind, but it always exhorts me to <lb/>
            eat and drink; and it makes me forget all things, as many as <lb/>
            I have suffered, and commands me to fill myself. But do <lb/>
            thou hasten, as soon as morning appears, that thou mayest <lb/>
            place me, wretched one, in mine own country, although I <lb/>
            have suffered many things; and may even life leave me on <lb/>
            beholding my possession, and my servants and lofty-roofed <lb/>
            large house."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, but they all approved and advised to con­ <lb/>
            duct the stranger, since he had spoken rightly. But when <lb/>
            they had made libations, and drunk as much as their mind <lb/>
            wished, they, each of them, went home about to sleep; but <lb/>
            divine Ulysses was left behind in the palace, and near him <lb/>
            sat Arete, and godlike Aleinous; and the handmaidens took <lb/>
            away the preparations of the feast. But white-armed Arete <lb/>
            began speaking to them, for she knew the veil and the tunic, <lb/>
            when she beheld the beautiful garments, which she herself <lb/>
            had wrought with her women attendants ; and addressing him, <lb/>
            she spoke winged words :</p>
          <p>“ O stranger, I will myself first ask thee this, who art thou ? <lb/>
            from whence art thou amongst men ? who gave thee these <lb/>
            garments ? Surely thou dost not say that thou earnest here <lb/>
            wandering over the sea?"</p>
          <p>But her the much-planning divine Ulysses addressed in <lb/>
            answer: " It is difficult, O queen, to relate my griefs entirely <lb/>
            through, since the heavenly gods have given me many; but <lb/>
            I will tell thee this which thou askest, and inquirest of me. <lb/>

            when Jupiter, having struck my swift ship with white thunder, <lb/>
            cleft it in the middle of the dark sea. There all the others <lb/>
            my excellent companions perished ; but I, laying hold of the <lb/>
            keel of the ship rowed on both sides, with my arms, was borne <lb/>
            along for nine days; but in the tenth black night the gods <lb/>
            made me approach the island Ogygia, where Calypso, the <lb/>
            fair-haired crafty goddess, dwells. She taking me loved me <lb/>
            earnestly, and nurtured me, and said that she would render <lb/>
            me immortal, and free from old age all my days ; but she did <lb/>
            not at all persuade the mind in my breast. There I remained <lb/>
            continually for seven years, and ever bedewed with tears the <lb/>
            garments which, not mortal-like, Calypso gave to me; but <lb/>
            when at length the eighth revolving year came, then indeed <lb/>
            she commanded me, inciting me to return, through a message <lb/>
            from Jove, or else her own mind was turned; and she sent <lb/>
            me on a raft bound with many chains ; and she gave me <lb/>
            many things, bread and sweet wine, and put immortal gar­ <lb/>
            ments on me: and she sent forth a harmless and gentle wind. <lb/>
            For seventeen days indeed I sailed, passing over the sea, but <lb/>
            on the eighteenth the shady mountains of thy land appeared; <lb/>
            and the dear heart of me, ill-fated one, rejoiced ; for still was <lb/>
            I about to be conversant with much calamity, which earth- <lb/>
            shaking Neptune raised up against me; who, having aroused <lb/>
            the winds against me, hampered my journey, and troubled the <lb/>
            immense sea: nor did the wave at all permit me mourning <lb/>
            ceaselessly to be borne on the raft: this then indeed the <lb/>
            storm scattered ; but I cut through this gulf swimming ; until <lb/>
            the wind and the water carrying me, made me approach thy <lb/>
            land. There, as I was going out, a billow forced me upon <lb/>
            the shore, dashing me against mighty rocks and an unpleasant <lb/>
            place; but retiring back I swam again, until I came to the <lb/>
            river, where there appeared to me [to be] the best place, <lb/>
            smooth from rocks; and there was also a shelter from the <lb/>
            wind. And I came out, collecting my senses:14 and ambrosial <lb/>
            night came on; but I, going out at a distance away from the <lb/>
            Jove-replenished river, slept among the tliiekets ; and drew <lb/>
            leaves about me; and a deity poured abundant sleep upon <lb/>
            me. Here indeed amongst the leaves I slept all night, sor­ <lb/>
            rowing in my heart, even until morn, and mid-day, and the <note type="footnote"> 14 <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνάγων καὶ ὰνακτώμενος ψυχήν</foreign>, Eustath. “gathering strength, <lb/>

            amongst them she herself was like unto goddesses. I sup­ <lb/>

            grieving, I have told thee the truth."</p>
          <p>But him Alcinous answered and addressed in turn: " O <lb/>
            guest, certainly my daughter did not consider this properly, <lb/>
            because she by no means brought thee to my house with her <lb/>
            women attendants ; thou, however, didst supplicate her first."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            “ Hero, do not on that account reprove thy spotless daughter: <lb/>
            for she commanded me to follow with her women attendants. <lb/>
            But I was not willing, fearing and being ashamed, lest by <lb/>
            chance thy mind should be angered when thou didst behold <lb/>
            me: for we tribes of men upon the earth are suspicious."</p>
          <p>But him Alcinous answered and addressed in turn : " Guest, <lb/>
            I have not such a heart within my breast, so as to be wrath <lb/>
            in vain ; but all things that are proper are better. Would <lb/>

            it without labour in the same day, and brought him back <lb/>
            home. And thou wilt thyself know how much my ships <lb/>
            and youths are the best, to cast up the sea with the blade of <lb/>
            the oar."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and much-enduring divine Ulysses re­ <lb/>
            joiced ; and then praying he spoke and said a word, and <lb/>
            called [on Jove] by name: “0 father Jove, may Alcinous <lb/>
            perform all the things, whatever he has said ! then indeed his <lb/>
            glory would be inextinguishable over the bounteous earth, and <lb/>
            I should reach my country."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke to one another. But white-armed Arete <lb/>
            had commanded her handmaidens to place couches under <lb/>
            the portico, and to throw upon them beautiful purple rugs, <lb/>
            and to strew tapestry above, and to place woollen cloaks <lb/>
            upon them, to spread over him. And they went from the <lb/>
            palace, holding a torch in their hands; but when they had <lb/>
            strewn the thick bed, hastening,16 they urged Ulysses with <lb/>
            words, standing near him: “Rise to go to rest, O stranger; <lb/>
            thy bed is made."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke; and it appeared to him delightful to go <lb/>
            to rest. Thus much-enduring divine Ulysses slept there in <lb/>
            the compact beds, under the sounding portico. But Alcinous <lb/>
            lay down in the recess of the lofty house; and near him his <lb/>
            wife the queen prepared a couch and bed. <note type="footnote"> 17 Literally, " stirring up the dust," a metaphor derived from the race­ <lb/>

          <p>An assembly of the Phæacians is convoked respecting Ulysses, and a vessel <lb/>
            is prepared for his departure. Aleinous entertains the Phæacian nobles <lb/>
            at his house; and the games begin. Dcmodoeus the bard first sings the <lb/>
            amours of Mars and Venus, and then the introduction of the wooden horse <lb/>
            into Troy. Ulysses is affected by his song, and Alcinous, perceiving it, <lb/>
            asks who he is, from whence he is come, and what is the occasion of his <lb/>
            sorrow.</p>
          <p>BUT when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, ap­ <lb/>
            peared, the sacred1 might of Alcinous rose from his bed, and <lb/>
            noble Ulysses, the sacker of cities, rose also. And the sacred <lb/>
            might of Alcinous led them to the assembly of the Phæacians, <lb/>
            which was prepared for them near the ships. And having come, <lb/>
            they sat down on the polished stones near [each other] ; but <lb/>
            Pallas Minerva went through the city, likened unto the herald <lb/>
            of prudent Alcinous, planning a return for strong-hearted <lb/>
            Ulysses. And standing near each man she addressed them :</p>
          <p>" Hither come, ye leaders and chiefs of the Phæacians, to <lb/>
            go to the assembly, that ye may hear of the stranger, who <lb/>
            lately came to the house of prudent Alcinous, having wan­ <lb/>
            dered over the sea, in person like unto the immortals."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, she incited the might and mind of <lb/>
            each. And the forums and seats were quickly filled with <lb/>
            men assembling together; for many admired the prudent son <lb/>
            of Laertes, as they beheld him, and Minerva shed divine grace <lb/>
            over his head and shoulders; and she made him taller and <lb/>
            greater to behold, that to all the Phæacians he might be dear <lb/>
            and awful and venerable, and might perform many contests, <lb/>
            at which the Phæacians tried Ulysses. But when they were <lb/>
            collected and assembled together, Alcinous harangued and <lb/>
            addressed them:</p>
          <p>" Hear, ye leaders and rulers over the Phæacians, whilst I <lb/>
            speak what my mind commands me in my breast. This <lb/>
            stranger, I know not who [he is], has come wandering unto my <lb/>
            house, whether from eastern or western men ; but he Incites <note type="footnote"> 1 Ernesti observes that this epithet is applied to Alcinous, as a king, <lb/>

            us [tc grant him] an escort, and prays for it to be safe. But <lb/>
            let us, as hitherto, make ready the escort. For no other person <lb/>
            who comes to my house, remains here a long time lamenting <lb/>
            on account of an escort.2 But come, we will draw a black ship <lb/>
            for its first voyage3 into the divine sea; and let two and fifty <lb/>
            youths4 be chosen amongst the people as many as hitherto <lb/>
            have been the best. And do ye all, having bound the oars well <lb/>
            to the benches, come out: but afterwards, coming to my house, <lb/>
            make ready a hasty feast; and I will supply it well for all. <lb/>
            These things I enjoin the youths ; but do ye the rest, sceptre- <lb/>
            bearing princes, come to my fair dwellings, that we may enter­ <lb/>
            tain the stranger kindly in our palace, nor let any one refuse ; <lb/>
            and call the divine bard Demodocus, for to him the deity has <lb/>
            granted song exceedingly, to delight in whatever his mind <lb/>
            incites him to sing."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he led the way; and the sceptre­ <lb/>
            bearers followed with him ; but the herald went for the <lb/>
            divine bard. And two and fifty youths, being chosen, went, <lb/>
            as he commanded, to the shore of the barren sea. But when, <lb/>
            indeed, they came to the ship and to the sea, they drew the <lb/>
            black ship into the deep of the sea, and they placed a mast <lb/>
            and sails in the black ship; and they fitted the oars in the <lb/>
            leather loops, all rightly, and they spread out the white sails ; <lb/>
            and they moored her high out upon the sea; but afterwards they <lb/>
            hastened to the great house of the prudent Alcinous. And the <lb/>
            porches and the enclosures and houses were filled with men <lb/>
            [collected together; and there were many young and old <lb/>
            men]. And Alcinous sacrificed twelve sheep for them, and <lb/>
            eight swine with white tusks, and two curve-footed oxen; these <lb/>
            they skinned and managed, and made ready a delightful feast. <lb/>
            And the herald came near, leading the harmonious bard, whom <lb/>
            the Muse loved exceedingly ; but she gave him both good and <lb/>
            evil; she deprived him indeed of his eyes, but gave him sweet <lb/>
            song.5 For him Pontonous placed a silver-studded throne in <note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. " through wanting one." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Not only nearly built, but also <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ πρώτη κατα τὸ πλέειν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ναυαρχίς</foreign>. <lb/>

            the middle of the guests, leaning it against a tall pillar: and <lb/>
            from a peg the herald had hung the clear-toned harp over his <lb/>
            head, and taught him how to take it with his hands <foreign xml:lang="grc">̇</foreign> and <lb/>
            near him he placed a basket, and a beautiful table, and near <lb/>
            him a cup of wine to drink, when his mind should incite him ; <lb/>
            they then stretched forth their hands to the food lying ready <lb/>
            before them.</p>
          <p>But when they had taken away the desire of drinking and <lb/>
            eating, the Muse encouraged the bard to sing the glories of <lb/>
            men, a song of which the fame then reached the wide heaven, <lb/>
            the strife of Ulysses and Achilles, son of Peleus, how they <lb/>
            formerly contended with vehement words in a splendid ban­ <lb/>
            quet of the gods; but Agamemnon, king of men, rejoiced in <lb/>
            his mind, when the chiefs of the Grecians contended ; for so <lb/>
            Phœbus Apollo, giving an oracle, told him in divine Pylos, <lb/>
            when he passed over the stone threshold to consult the oracle : <lb/>
            for then the beginning of harm rolled on to the Trojans and <lb/>
            the Grecians, through the will of mighty Jove.</p>
          <p>These things the illustrious bard sang ; but Ulysses, taking <lb/>
            a large purple veil in his sturdy hands, drew it over his head, <lb/>
            and covered his beauteous face; for he was ashamed before <lb/>
            the Phæacians, shedding tears from under his eyebrows. But <lb/>
            when the divine bard had ceased singing, having wiped away <lb/>
            the tears, he took the veil from his head, and taking a round <lb/>
            cup,6 he made libations to the gods : but when he7 began <lb/>
            again, and the chiefs of the Phæacians incited him to sing, <lb/>
            since they were delighted with his verses, Ulysses again, cover­ <lb/>
            ing his head, mourned. Then indeed he escaped the notice of <lb/>
            all the others, shedding tears, but Alcinous alone, sitting near <lb/>
            him, marked and perceived him ; for he heard him mourning <lb/>
            heavily; he immediately therefore addressed the oar-loving <lb/>
            Phæacians:</p>
          <p>“ Hear, ye leaders and rulers over the Phæacians, we are <note type="footnote"> amusing illustrations in Duport, Gnomol. Horn. p. 184. So Milton, Par. <lb/>

            now satisfied in our mind with the equal banquet, and the <lb/>
            harp, which is suited to the abundant feast; but now let us <lb/>
            go out, and try all the contests ; that also the stranger, return­ <lb/>
            ing home, may tell his friends how much we excel others in <lb/>
            pugilism, wrestling, and leaping, and in the race."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken lie led the way, and they followed to­ <lb/>
            gether ; and from the peg he hung the clear-toned harp: and <lb/>
            the herald took the hand of Demodocus, and led him out of <lb/>
            the palace ; and he went before him the same way which the <lb/>
            others, the chiefs of the Phæacians, had gone, to behold the <lb/>
            contests. But they went to the forum, and a great crowd <lb/>
            followed together, myriads. And there stood up many and ex­ <lb/>
            cellent youths. There arose indeed Acroneus, and Ocyalus, <lb/>
            and Elatreus, and Nauteus, and Prymneus, and Anchialus, and <lb/>
            Eretmeus, and Ponteus, and Proreus, (and) Thoon, and Ana­ <lb/>
            besineus, and Amphialus, son of Polynëus, son of Tecton ; and <lb/>
            there also rose up Euryalus, equal to manslaughtering Mars, <lb/>
            and Naubolides, who was the most excellent of all the Phæa­ <lb/>
            cians in form and person, after the blameless Laodamas; and <lb/>
            there arose the three blameless sons of Alcinous, Laodamas, <lb/>
            and Halius, and divine Clytonëus. Some then indeed first <lb/>
            made trial in the race; and a course was extended for them <lb/>
            from the goal, and they all flew swiftly together, raising the <lb/>
            dust along the plain. Of them the blameless Clytonëus was the <lb/>
            best in running; and as far as is the distance between mules <lb/>
            land oxen] in fallow land,8 so far running on before, became <lb/>
            up to the people, but the others were left behind. But others <lb/>
            made trial of laborious wrestling ; in this Euryalus excelled all <lb/>
            the chiefs ; but in leaping Amphialus was the best of all. But <lb/>
            on the other hand Elatreus was the most excellent of all with <lb/>
            the quoit; and again Laodamas, the doughty son of Alcinous, <lb/>
            in pugilism. But when all were delighted in their mind with <lb/>
            the contests, Laodamas, son of Alcinous, addressed them:</p>
          <p>" Come, my friends, let us ask the stranger if he knows <lb/>
            and has learnt any contest. Indeed he is not mean as to his <lb/>
            nature, his thighs, and legs, and both his hands above, and his <lb/>
            stout neck and mighty strength; nor is he wanting at all in <note type="footnote"> 8 Literally, "as far as is the distance of mules in fallow land." Clytonëus <lb/>
            was as far in advance of his competitors, as there is left space between <lb/>
            mules and oxen, when they are yoked together to plough a fallow land. <lb/>

            yonth, but he is broken down by many ills. For I do not <lb/>
            think that there is any thing else worse than the sea to <lb/>
            weaken a man, even though he be very strong."</p>
          <p>Euryalus answered and addressed him in turn : “0 Laoda­ <lb/>
            mas, thou hast spoken this word very rightly; do thou now <lb/>
            go and challenge him, and speak to him a word." But when <lb/>
            the excellent son of Alcinous heard this, he then stood, going <lb/>
            in the middle, and addressed Ulysses: " Do thou also come <lb/>
            hither, O father stranger, and make trial of the contests, if <lb/>
            thou hast by chance learnt any: and it is likely that thou <lb/>
            art acquainted with contests. For there is not any greater <lb/>
            renown for a man, whilst he exists, than what he shall have <lb/>
            done with his feet and his hands. But come, make trial, and <lb/>
            disperse cares from thy mind: for thy voyage will not long <lb/>
            be delayed; but the ship has just now been drawn out, and <lb/>
            companions are ready.,,</p>
          <p>Much-planning Ulysses answering addressed him : “0 <lb/>
            Laodamas, why do ye command these things, cutting me to <lb/>
            the heart ? griefs are even more in my mind than contests, I <lb/>
            who before indeed suffered very many things, and have en­ <lb/>
            dured many labours: but now I sit in your assembly desiring <lb/>
            a return, entreating the king and all the people."</p>
          <p>But him Euryalus answered in turn, and chided openly: "I <lb/>
            by no means liken thee, O stranger, to a man skilled in con­ <lb/>
            tests, such as there are many amongst men. But [I liken <lb/>
            thee] to him, who constantly being in a many-benched ship, <lb/>
            [is] a ruler of sailors, who are also merchants, and is mindful <lb/>
            of his freight, and a superintendent of provisions, and rapa­ <lb/>
            cious profits; nor art thou at all like unto a wrestler."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses, looking sternly, address­ <lb/>
            ed : " O stranger, thou hast not spoken well; you are like <lb/>
            unto an injurious man: thus the gods do not bestow graceful <lb/>
            accomplishments on all men, neither nature, nor mind, nor <lb/>
            eloquence; for one man in appearance is weaker, but God <lb/>
            adorns his form with words, and others look upon him with <lb/>
            delight. But he discourses safely with mild modesty, and <lb/>
            excels amongst those who are assembled together: and they <lb/>
            look upon him, when coming through the city, as upon a god. <lb/>
            Another again is like unto the immortals in his form, but grace <lb/>
            does not crown his words.9 So also thy form is handsome, <note type="footnote"> 9 Literally, " grace is not set as a crown around his words." </note> <pb n="104"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="177—200."/> <lb/>
            nor would a god fashion it otherwise; but thou art foolish in <lb/>
            thine understanding: thou hast provoked my mind in my <lb/>
            breast, having spoken not according to propriety; but I am <lb/>
            not unskilled in contests, as thou, forsooth, dost say, but I <lb/>
            think that I was amongst the first, when I trusted in my youth, <lb/>
            and in my hands. But now I am held fast by calamity and griefs; <lb/>
            for I have endured many things, both wars amongst men, and <lb/>
            passing over the grievous waves; but even thus, although having <lb/>
            suffered many evils, I will make trial of the contests, for thy <lb/>
            language is galling to the mind ;10 and thou hast provoked me <lb/>
            by thy words."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and rushing with his garment as it was,11 he seized <lb/>
            a very large and thick quoit, no little firmer, than with what <lb/>
            the Phæacians played at quoits with one another. Whirling <lb/>
            this round, he hurled it from his strong hand; but the stone <lb/>
            whizzed; and the Phæacians, who use long oars, sea-famous <lb/>
            men, crouched down upon the earth from the throw of the <lb/>
            stone; but it flew over all the marks, rushing easily from his <lb/>
            hand; for Minerva, likened in person unto a man, had set <lb/>
            the boundaries, and spoke and said :</p>
          <p>" Even a blind man, O stranger, groping about, would dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish the mark ; since it is by no means mingled with the <lb/>
            multitude, but is far the foremost; but do thou be confident, <lb/>
            at least as to this contest; no one of the Phæacians shall <lb/>
            reach this, nor pass beyond it."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke; but much-enduring divine Ulysses was <lb/>
            glad, rejoicing, because he perceived a kind friend in the ring, <lb/>
            and then he addressed the Phæacians more lightly: "Reach this <lb/>
            now, O youths; but I think that I will soon send another as <lb/>
            large, or even larger. Of the others, whomsoever12 his heart <lb/>
            and mind exhorts, let him come hither and make trial (since ye <lb/>
            have irritated me very much) either in pugilism, or in wrestling, <lb/>
            or even in the race, I grudge not at all, of all the Phæacians, [I <lb/>
            say,] except Laodamas himself: for he is my host; and who <lb/>

            deed is foolish and worth nothing, whoever proposes a strife in <lb/>
            contests with his host, among a foreign people ; and he makes <lb/>
            all his own affairs worse: but of the others I refuse not nor <lb/>
            despise anyone, but I wish to know and to make trial openly; <lb/>
            for I am not insignificant in all things, as many contests as <lb/>
            there are amongst men. For I know well how to handle the <lb/>
            well-polished bow ; I could hit a man the first, darting arrows <lb/>
            in a crowd of hostile men ; even though very many com­ <lb/>
            panions should stand near, and should direct their bows <lb/>
            against the men. Philoctetes indeed alone excelled me with <lb/>
            the bow, amongst the people of the Trojans, where we Greeks <lb/>
            used our bows. But of the others I say that I am far the <lb/>
            best, as many as are now mortals eating food upon the earth. <lb/>
            But I am not willing to contend with former men, neither <lb/>
            with Hercules, nor Eurytus the Œchalian, who contended <lb/>
            even with the immortals about bows : therefore mighty Eury­ <lb/>
            tus died immediately, nor did he attain to old age in his <lb/>
            palace; for Apollo, wrath with him, slew him, because he <lb/>
            challenged him to a contest of archery. And I dart with a <lb/>
            spear, as far as no one else would with an arrow. I fear for <lb/>
            my feet alone, lest any one of the Phæacians should pass me; <lb/>
            for I have been very greatly beaten down in many waves: <lb/>
            since there was no continual provision13 for oneself in a ship ; <lb/>
            therefore my limbs are relaxed."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, but they all were speechless in silence; <lb/>
            and Alcinous alone answering addressed him : “0 stranger, <lb/>
            since thou dost not speak these things unpleasant to us, but <lb/>
            dost wish to show thy prowess, which accompanies thee, being <lb/>
            angry, because this man standing in the contest has chided <lb/>
            thee; in order that no mortal may blame thy prowess, who­ <lb/>

            we run swiftly with our feet, and are the best in [managing] <lb/>

            one go immediately, and bring the clear-toned harp for De­ <lb/>

          <p>Thus spoke godlike Alcinous ; but the herald rose to bring <lb/>
            the sweet harp from the house of the king. And all the nine <lb/>
            public chosen umpires14 rose up, who managed every thing <lb/>
            well in the contests: and they made the floor smooth, and <lb/>
            widened the beautiful ring. And the herald came near, bring­ <lb/>
            ing the clear-toned harp to Demodocus; and he then went <lb/>
            into the middie ; and around him there stood youths in the <lb/>
            prime of life, skilled in the dance: and they struck the divine <lb/>
            floor15 with their feet: but Ulysses regarded the twinklings <lb/>
            of their feet, and marvelled in his mind.</p>
          <p>But he playing on the harp struck up17 to sing beautifully, <lb/>
            about the love of Mars and beautifully-crowned Venus, how <lb/>
            they at first had intercourse stealthily in the house of Vulcan : <lb/>
            for he gave her many things, and disgraced the couch and <lb/>
            bed of king Vulcan; but to him there immediately came as a <lb/>
            messenger the Sun, who perceived them mixed in love. But <lb/>
            Vulcan, when he heard the heart-paining talc, hastened to his <lb/>
            smithy, deeply planning evils in his mind : he placed a mighty <lb/>
            anvil on the stock, and forged chains not to be broken or loosed, <lb/>
            that they might remain there fixed. But after he had contrived <lb/>
            the stratagem, enraged with Mars, he hastened to the chamber, <lb/>
            where his dear bed lay. And then around the bed-posts he <lb/>
            puts chains in a circle on every side; and many were fitted <lb/>
            above from the ceiling, as slender cobwebs, which no one <lb/>
            could see, even of the blessed gods; for they were made ex­ <lb/>

            around the bed, he pretended that he would go to Lcmnos, a <note type="footnote"> 14 The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσυμνήτης</foreign> was originally applied to the governors of the <lb/>

            well-built city, which to him is by far the dearest of all lands. 18 <lb/>
            Nor did golden-bridled Mars keep a blind look-out, when he <lb/>
            beheld Vulcan, illustrious for his art, going to a distance; he <lb/>
            hastened to the house of illustrious Vulcan, desirous of the <lb/>
            love of beauteous-crowned Venus. But she having lately <lb/>
            come from her father, the powerful son of Saturn, sat down <lb/>
            but he went within the house, and laid hold of her by the <lb/>
            hand, and spoke and addressed her:</p>
          <p>" Come, dear one, let us twain turn to bed to lie down ; for <lb/>
            Vulcan is not at home, but is now gone some where to Lemnos, <lb/>
            to the barbarous Sintians."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and to her it seemed delightful to go to <lb/>
            bed. They twain mounting the couch laid down to rest; but <lb/>
            the artful chains of ingenious Vulcan were spread around <lb/>
            them, nor could they by any means move their limbs, nor rise <lb/>
            up. And then indeed they knew that there were no longer <lb/>
            means of escape. But illustrious Vulcan came near them, <lb/>
            returning again before he reached the land of Lemnos: for <lb/>
            the Sun kept a look-out for him, and told him the affair : land <lb/>
            he hastened home, sorrowing in his dear heart ;] and he stood <lb/>
            in the vestibule; and fierce anger possessed him, and he <lb/>
            shouted terribly, and called aloud to all the gods.</p>
          <p>" O father Jove, and ye other blessed gods who exist ever, <lb/>
            come, that ye may behold deeds not to be laughed at nor en­ <lb/>
            dured ; how Venus, the daughter of Jove, always dishonours <lb/>
            me who am lame, and loves all-destructive Mars; because he <lb/>
            is handsome and sound-footed, but I am become weak; but <lb/>
            there is no one to blame for me, but my two parents, who <lb/>
            ought not to have produced me. But see where they sleep <lb/>
            together in love, having ascended my bed; but I am grieved <lb/>

          <p>Thus he spoke ; and the gods were assembled at the brazen <lb/>
            house: earth-shaking Neptune came, all-beneficent 19 Mercury <lb/>
            came, and the far-darting king Apollo came: but the female <lb/>
            deities each remained at home through shame. And the <lb/>
            gods, bestowers of good things,20 stood in the vestibule; and <lb/>
            there arose an inextinguishable laughter amongst the blessed <lb/>
            gods, when they saw the arts of ingenious Vulcan. But <lb/>
            thus some one 21 said, looking to another who was near: <lb/>
            " Evil works do not succeed: the slow overtakes the quick: <lb/>
            as now Vulcan, although slow, has caught Mars, the swiftest <lb/>
            of the gods who possess Olympus, he being lame, [has caught <lb/>
            him] by his art; wherefore he owns a fine for being detected <lb/>
            in adultery."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke such things to one another; and king <lb/>
            Apollo, the son of Jove, addressed Mercury: "0 Mercury, <lb/>
            son of Jove, messenger, giver of good things, wouldst thou <lb/>
            be willing, pressed in strong chains, to sleep in the bed near <lb/>
            golden Venus ?</p>
          <p>But him the messenger, the slayer of Argus, immediately <lb/>
            addressed: " I wish this might happen, O king, far-darting <lb/>
            Apollo, (and) might thrice so many immense chains surround <lb/>
            me, and ye gods behold, and all the goddesses, yet I would <lb/>
            sleep near golden Venus."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, and laughter arose amongst the immortal <lb/>
            gods. But laughter did not possess Neptune; but he constantly <lb/>
            entreated the illustrious artificer Vulcan, that he would loose <lb/>
            Mars: and addressing him, spoke winged words: " Loose­ <lb/>
            him ; and I promise that he shall pay, as thou commandest, <lb/>
            all the things that are proper amongst the immortal gods."</p>
          <p>But him illustrious Vulcan addressed in turn : " Do not, O <lb/>

              oblige you, among the immortal gods, if Mars should go away, <lb/>
              having escaped the debt and the chain?"</p>
          <p>But him Earth-shaking Neptune addressed in turn: "0 <lb/>
            Vulcan, even though Mars, escaping from the debt, should go <lb/>
            away flying, I myself will pay thee these things."</p>
          <p>But him illustrious Vulcan immediately answered: " It is <lb/>
            not possible, nor is it meet to reject thy word."</p>
          <p>Thus speaking, the might of Vulcan loosed the chain. <lb/>
            When they were loosed from the chain, although it was strong, <lb/>
            both rushing forth immediately, he (Mars) went to Thrace, but <lb/>
            she, the laughter-loving Venus, came to Cyprus, to Paphos, <lb/>
            where is her grove and incensed altar: here the Graces washed <lb/>
            her, and anointed her with immortal oil, such as glosses over <lb/>
            the gods who exist for ever: and they put beautiful garments <lb/>
            around her, a marvel to behold.</p>
          <p>These things the illustrious bard sang; and Ulysses was <lb/>
            delighted in his mind as he heard it, and also the other <lb/>
            Phæacians who use long oars, illustrious sailors. But Alcinous <lb/>
            commanded IIalius and Laodamas to dance alone, since no <lb/>
            one rivalled them. When then they had taken the beautiful <lb/>
            purple ball in their hands, which skilful Polybus made for them, <lb/>
            one of them, bent backwards, threw it towards the shadowy <lb/>
            clouds ; and the other, having raised himself on high from the <lb/>
            earth, easily laid hold of it, before he reached the ground with <lb/>
            his feet. But when they had made trial with the ball straight <lb/>
            upwards, they afterwards danced on the fruitful earth, fre­ <lb/>
            quently throwing it from one to another, and the other youths <lb/>
            applauded, standing in the ring ; and a great noise arose un­ <lb/>
            der [their feet]. Then divine Ulysses addressed Alcinous:</p>
          <p>" O King Alcinous, most illustrious of all the people, you <lb/>
            certainly engaged23 that you were the best dancers, and cer­ <lb/>
            tainly these things have been accomplished ; astonishment <lb/>
            possesses me as I behold."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and the sacred might of Alcinous re­ <lb/>
            joiced; and he immediately addressed the oar-loving Phæa­ <lb/>
            cians: "Listen, ye leaders and rulers over the Phæaeians, <lb/>
            the stranger seems to me to be very prudent. But come, let <lb/>
            us give him a present of hospitality, as is just; for twelve ex­ <lb/>
            cellent princes rule, chieftains amongst the people, and I myself <note type="footnote"> 23 Literally, " threatened," which we sometimes say in English, with <lb/>
            a jocular meaning </note> <pb n="110"/>

            am the thirteenth; of whom do each of you bring a well- <lb/>
            washed veil, and a tunic, and a talent of precious gold. And <lb/>
            let us all together immediately bring them, that the stranger, <lb/>
            having them in his hands, may go to supper rejoicing in his <lb/>
            mind: but let Euryalus appease him with words and a present; <lb/>
            since he did not speak rightly."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but they all praised, and ordered it; and <lb/>
            each of them despatched a herald to fetch the gifts; but him <lb/>
            Euryalus answered, and addressed in turn :</p>
          <p>" O king Alcinous, most illustrious of all the people, there­ <lb/>
            fore I will appease the stranger, as thou commandest; I will <lb/>
            give him this all-brazen sword, whose hilt is silver, and a <lb/>
            scabbard of newly-sawn ivory is set around it; and it will be <lb/>
            worth much to him."</p>
          <p>Thus saying, he placed the silver-studded sword in his <lb/>
            hands, and speaking winged words, addressed him</p>
          <p>" Hail, O father stranger; and if any grievous word has <lb/>
            been uttered, may the storms, having snatched it up imme­ <lb/>
            diately, carry it away; but to thee may the gods grant both <lb/>
            to behold thy wife, and to reach thy country; since thou art <lb/>
            suffering misfortunes a long time away from friends."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " Much hail thou also, friend, and may the gods give thee <lb/>
            happiness; nor mayest thou hereafter at all have regret for <lb/>
            this sword, which thou hast given me, appeasing me with <lb/>
            words."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and girt about his shoulders the silver-studded <lb/>
            sword; and the sun set, and the famous gifts were present for <lb/>
            him. And the noble heralds bore them to [the house] of <lb/>
            Alcinous ; and the sons of illustrious Alcinous having re­ <lb/>
            ceived them, placed the very beautiful gifts near their vener­ <lb/>
            able mother. And the sacred might of Alcinous led the way <lb/>
            for them, and coming they sat on lofty thrones; then truly <lb/>
            mighty Alcinous addressed Arete :</p>
          <p>"Hither, lady, bring a handsome chest, whichever is best; <lb/>
            and in it place a well-washed cloak, and a tunic; and warm <lb/>
            for him a brazen vessel with fire, and heat water, that both <lb/>
            having washed himself, and having seen all the presents <lb/>
            placed In order, which the illustrious Phæacians have brought <lb/>
            here, he may be delighted both with the banquet, and by <lb/>
            hearing the chaunt of song : and I will give him this my cup, <pb n="111"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="430—465."/> <lb/>
            very beautiful, golden, that remembering me all his days, he <lb/>
            may pour forth libations in his palace, both to Jove and the <lb/>
            other gods."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and Arete told her handmaidens, with all <lb/>
            haste to place a large tripod on the fire. And they placed a <lb/>
            three-footed laver on the bright fire; and poured water in it, <lb/>
            and taking wood kindled it beneath. The fire encircled the <lb/>
            belly24 of the tripod, and the water was warmed. But in <lb/>
            the meanwhile Arete brought out of her chamber a very <lb/>
            beautiful chest for the stranger, and placed in it handsome <lb/>
            presents, a garment, and gold, which the Phæacians gave <lb/>
            him; and in it she put a cloak and beautiful tunic, and speak­ <lb/>
            ing, addressed to him winged words :</p>
          <p>" Thyself now look to the lid, and quickly put a chain <lb/>
            upon it,25 lest any one should defraud thee on thy way, when <lb/>
            again thou sleepest sweet slumber, going in the black ship."</p>
          <p>But when much-enduring divine Ulysses heard this, he <lb/>
            immediately fitted on the lid, and quickly put upon it a <lb/>
            various chain, which venerable Circe sometime taught him in <lb/>
            his mind. And the housekeeper bade him forthwith wash <lb/>
            himself, having gone into the bathing tub: and he gladly in <lb/>
            his mind beheld the warm bath ; because he had not been at <lb/>
            all used to take care of himself since he left the dwelling of <lb/>
            the fair-haired Calypso; but so long at least care of himself <lb/>
            was continual to him, as to a god. When therefore the hand­ <lb/>
            maidens had washed and anointed him with oil, and had <lb/>
            thrown about him a beautiful mantle and tunic, having gone <lb/>
            out of the bath, he went to the men who were drinking wine ; <lb/>
            but Nausicaa, possessing beauty from the gods, stood by a <lb/>
            pillar of the well-made roof; and she admired Ulysses, seeing <lb/>
            him with her eyes, and speaking she addressed to him winged <lb/>
            words: " Farewell, stranger, that sometime being in thy pa­ <lb/>
            ternal land thou mayest remember me, that thou owest to me <lb/>
            first the debt of preservation of thy life."</p>
          <p>But her much-counselling Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " Nausicaa, daughter of strong-hearted Alcinous, thus now <lb/>
            may Jove, the mighty-sounding husband of Juno, grant to <note type="footnote"> 24 Or the lower part, rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυθμένα</foreign>. Schol. </note><note type="footnote"> 25 " In ancient times it was the custom to secure boxes with straps. <lb/>

            me botl. to go home, and to see the day of my return: then <lb/>
            there also to thee, as to a deity, would I pray still all my days <lb/>
            for thou hast saved my life, O damsel."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and sat on a throne near king Alcinous. And <lb/>
            they now both divided the shares [of the feast], and mixed <lb/>
            wine. And a herald came near, bringing the harmonious <lb/>
            bard, Demodocus, honoured by the people; and he sat him in <lb/>
            the midst of the feasters, having propped him against a lofty <lb/>
            column. Then indeed much-planning Ulysses addressed the <lb/>
            herald, having first cut off [a portion] from the back; and <lb/>
            a great part of a white-tusked swine was left, and rich fat <lb/>
            was about it.</p>
          <p>" Herald, take and give this flesh to Demodocus, that lie <lb/>
            may eat; and I will embrace him, although grieved. For by <lb/>
            all earthly men bards are allotted honour and respect, because <lb/>
            indeed the Muse has taught them songs, and loves the tribe <lb/>
            of bards."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but the herald, bringing it, placed it in <lb/>
            the hands of the hero Demodocus; and he received it and re­ <lb/>
            joiced in his mind. And they stretched forth their hands to <lb/>
            the food which lay ready before them. But when they had <lb/>
            taken away the desire of drinking and eating, then truly <lb/>
            much-planning Ulysses addressed Demodocus:</p>
          <p>" O Demodocus, I indeed praise thee above all mortals; <lb/>
            either the Muse, child of Jove, has taught thee, or Apollo at <lb/>
            least; for thou singest well in order the fate of the Achæans, <lb/>
            both what things they did, and suffered, and what things the <lb/>
            Achæans laboured ; as if perchance either being thyself pre­ <lb/>
            sent, or having heard from another. But come now, change [the <lb/>
            strain] and sing the preparation of the wooden horse, which <lb/>
            Epeus made with Minerva, which divine Ulysses formerly <lb/>
            brought into the citadel, a stratagem, having filled it with men <lb/>
            who sacked Ilium. If indeed thou shouldst tell me these <lb/>
            things in order, I will immediately tell to all men, how a kind <lb/>
            god has bestowed on thee divine song."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and he, inspired by the god, began, and <lb/>
            showed forth his song, taking it from thence, how the Argives, <lb/>
            some indeed having embarked in the well-benched ships, sailed <lb/>
            away, having hurled fire into their tents; and others now were <lb/>
            sitting around all-famous Ulysses in the forum of the Trojans, <pb n="113"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="504—513."/> <lb/>
            being covered in the horse; for the Trojans themselves had <lb/>
            drawn it into the citadel. Thus it stood; 26 and they sitting about <lb/>
            it spoke many undecided things; and counsel pleased them <lb/>
            three ways, either to cut through the hollow wood with the <lb/>
            hard brass, or having dragged it to a summit, to cast it down <lb/>
            the rocks, or to permit the great image to be a propitiation of <lb/>
            the gods, as it was even afterwards about to be brought to <lb/>
            pass. For it was fated that it should perish, when the city <lb/>
            should cover around27 a great wooden horse, where all the <lb/>
            best of the Argivcs sat, bearing slaughter and Fate to the <lb/>
            Trojans. And he sang how the sons of the Greeks destroyed <lb/>
            the city, being poured forth from the horse, having left the <lb/>
            hollow ambush. He sang that one laid waste28 the lofty city <lb/>
            ;n one way, and another in another; but that Ulysses, the® <lb/>
            Mars, went to the house of Deiphobus with godlike Menelaus. <lb/>
            There indeed he said, that he, having dared a very fierce <lb/>
            battle, conquered afterwards by means of strong-hearted Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva. These things, then, the very famous bard sang ; but <lb/>
            Ulysses was melted, and a tear moistened his cheeks under his <lb/>
            eyelids. And as a woman weeps falling about her dear bus­ <lb/>
            band, who falls before his own city and people, warding off <lb/>
            the fatal day from his town and children; she indeed, gazing <lb/>
            on him dying and gasping, spread about him laments shrilly; <lb/>
            but they behind smiting her with spears on the back and the <lb/>
            shoulders, lead her into captivity, to have both toil and ca­ <lb/>
            lamity, and with most piteous grief her cheeks fade. So <lb/>
            Ulysses poured a piteous tear from under his eye-brows. <lb/>
            Then indeed he escaped the notice of all the others, pouring <lb/>
            forth tears, but Alcinous alone observed and perceived him, <lb/>
            sitting near him, and heard him mourning heavily; and im­ <lb/>
            mediately addressed the oar-loving Phæacians :</p>
          <p>" Hear, ye leaders and rulers over the Phæacians, and let <lb/>
            Demodocus now stop his clear-toned harp; for somehow he <lb/>
            does not sing these things gratifying to all. From the time <lb/>
            when we were supping, and the divine bard began, from this <lb/>
            time the stranger has not by any means ceased from mournful <lb/>
            grief; some great sorrow surrounds his mind ; but come, let him <lb/>
            stop, that we may all alike be delighted, hosts and guest; since <note type="footnote"> 26 Compare Virg. Æn. ii. 31, sqq. Petron. Arb. § 123. Eurip. Tread <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="644- 580."/> <lb/>
            thus it is much more honourable. For these things are prepared <lb/>
            on account of the venerable stranger, an escort, and grateful <lb/>
            presents, which we entertaining [him] bestow on him. The <lb/>
            stranger and suppliant is considered in the place of a brother by a <lb/>
            man who partakes of understanding even a little. Do thou there­ <lb/>
            fore now not conceal by crafty thoughts what I shall ask thee ; <lb/>
            but it is better that thou shouldst say. Tell the name, what­ <lb/>
            ever both thy mother and father there called thee, and others <lb/>
            who dwell in and around the city; for no one of men is alto­ <lb/>
            gether nameless, neither bad nor good, since he was first born, <lb/>
            but parents give [names] to all, when they bring them forth. <lb/>
            And tell me thy land, and people, and city: that our ships <lb/>
            calculating in thought29 may conduct thee thither. For there <lb/>
            are no pilots for the Phæacians, nor are there rudders at all, <lb/>
            which other ships have; but they themselves ken the thoughts <lb/>
            and minds of men. And they ken the cities and rich fields of all <lb/>
            men ; and very swiftly pass over the ridge of the sea, covered <lb/>
            with darkness and a cloud; nor is there fear at any time for <lb/>
            them, that they will be either harmed at all or perish. But <lb/>
            I have heard my father Nausithous sometime telling these <lb/>
            things thus, who said that Neptune was indignant with us, <lb/>
            because we are harmless conductors of all. He said that he <lb/>
            would sometime destroy a well-worked ship of the Phæacian <lb/>
            men returning from a conduct on the shadowy sea, and that a <lb/>
            great mountain [of waves] 30 should cover around our city. <lb/>
            Thus the old man spoke; which things the god will either <lb/>
            accomplish, or they will be not accomplished, as is grateful to <lb/>
            his mind. But come, tell me this and inform me truly, both <lb/>
            whither thou hast wandered, and to what lands of men thou <lb/>
            hast come ; both themselves and their well-inhabited cities. <lb/>
            And how many are both cruel, and rough, and not just; and <lb/>
            who [are] hospitable, and have a mind which regards the gods. <lb/>
            Say too at what thou weepest, and art grieving within thine <lb/>
            heart, on hearing the calamity of the Argives, Danaans, and <lb/>
            Ilium. That [calamity] the gods indeed devised, and destined <lb/>
            destruction for men, that it may be a [subject of] song even to <note type="footnote"> 28 These " thinking ships " of Homer's are almost as clever as the <lb/>

          <p>Ulysses begins the narrative of his adventures. He relates how he fought <lb/>
            with the Ciconians, and destroyed Ismarus; that he then came to the <lb/>

            it [lie] towards the east and the sun,) craggy, but a good <lb/>
            nourisher of youths; I cannot at all behold any thing else <lb/>
            sweeter than this island. Certainly, indeed, Calypso, divine <lb/>
            one of goddesses, kept me away from thence [in her hollow <lb/>
            caves, desiring that I should be her husband] ;5 so in like <lb/>

            siring that I should be her husband; but they did not at all <lb/>
            persuade the mind in my breast. Since nothing is sweeter <lb/>

            return, which Jove sent upon me when I went from Troy.</p>
          <p>" The wind bearing me from Ilium made me approach the <lb/>
            Ciconians in Ismarus; and there I laid waste the city, and <lb/>
            destroyed them.6 And taking their wives and many pos­ <lb/>
            sessions out of the city, we divided them, that no one might <lb/>
            go deprived of an equal share. Then indeed I ordered that <lb/>
            we should fly with a moist foot ;7 but they very foolish did <lb/>
            not obey me. There they drank much wine, and slew many <lb/>
            sheep near the shore, and beeves curve-footed, bent-horn. <lb/>
            But in the mean time the Ciconians going called upon the <lb/>
            Ciconians, who were their neighbours, both more in number, <lb/>
            and braver, who inhabit the continent, knowing how to fight <lb/>
            with men from horses, and, when there is need, being on foot. <lb/>
            Then they came in the morning, as many in number as are the <lb/>
            leaves and flowers in spring ; then at length evil fate from Jove <lb/>
            stood over ill-fated us, that we should suffer many griefs. And <lb/>

            spears. Whilst it was morning, and sacred day grew on, so long <lb/>
            we remained, warding them off, although they were more in <lb/>
            number: but when the sun changed its journey towards even­ <lb/>
            ing,8 then at length the Ciconians, subduing the Achæans, put <lb/>
            them to flight. Six well-greavcd companions out of each ship <lb/>
            perished ; but the rest of us escaped death and fate. And from <lb/>
            thence we sailed forward sorrowing in our heart, rejoicing [at <lb/>
            our own escape] from death, having lost our dear companions. <lb/>
            Nor yct9 did my ships rolling on both sides proceed, before <lb/>
            we thrice cried out to each one 10 of our wretched companions, <lb/>
            who died in the plain, slain by the Ciconians. And cloud- <lb/>
            compelling Jove stirred up a north wind against our ships, <lb/>
            with a divine whirlwind, and he covered the earth and the <lb/>
            sea together with clouds; and night arose from heaven. <lb/>
            They then were borne along to leeward, and the force of <lb/>
            the wind rent their sails in three and four places. And these11 <lb/>
            we let down into the ships, dreading destruction, and we <lb/>
            drew them12 eagerly forward to the continent. There two <lb/>
            nights and two days we lay continually, consuming our mind <lb/>
            at the same time both with toil and griefs: but when at <lb/>
            length fair-haired morning brought about the third day, hav­ <lb/>
            ing set up our masts, and drawn up our white sails, we sat <lb/>
            down ; and the wind and the helmsman guided them straight <lb/>
            along. And now I should have reached my paternal land <lb/>
            unharmed, but the billow and the stream and the north wind <lb/>
            thrust me away as I was doubling Malea, and made me wander <lb/>

              then we landed on the continent, and drew water; and im­ <lb/>

              as third,13 in company with them, to go14 and inquire, what <lb/>
              men they were who eat food upon the land. But they, going <lb/>
              immediately, were mingled with the Lotus-eating men: nor <lb/>
              did the Lotophagi devise destruction for our companions, but <lb/>
              they gave them to taste of the lotus. But whoever of them <lb/>
              eat of the pleasant food of the lotus, he no longer wished to <lb/>
              bring back news, nor to return, but they preferred to remain <lb/>
              there with the Lotophagi eating lotus, and to be forgetful of <lb/>
              return. Them indeed weeping I by force led to the ships, <lb/>
              and dragging, bound them under the benches in the hol­ <lb/>
              low ships. But I exhorted my other beloved companions, <lb/>
              to hasten and embark on the swift ships, lest by chance any <lb/>
              one eating of the lotus, should be forgetful of return. But <lb/>
              they immediately embarked, and sat down on the benches; <lb/>
              and sitting in order they smote the hoary sea with their oars.</p>

              of the land of the Cyclops, not very near, nor far off, woody : <lb/>
              and in it wild goats are produced in boundless number ; for the <lb/>
              step of men does not interfere with them : nor do hunters, who <lb/>
              undergo toils in the wood, searching the tops of mountains, <lb/>
              go over it. It is neither kept by flocks, nor by ploughing?, <lb/>
              but itself, for all days unsown and untilled, is bereft of men, <lb/>
              and feeds bleating goats. For the Cyclops have not vermil­ <lb/>
              lipn-prowed ships, nor are there men amongst them builders <lb/>
              of ships, who can make well-benched ships, which would per­ <lb/>
              form every thing, going to the cities of men: as frequently <lb/>
              men, who have prepared for themselves a well-inhabited <lb/>
              island, pass in ships over the sea, one to another: for it is not <lb/>
              at all bad, but would produce every thing in season. For <lb/>
              there are in it watery, soft meadows, near the banks of the <lb/>
              hoary sea; and the vines would be very unperishable. And <lb/>
              in it the tillage is light; and they would always reap a deep <lb/>
              harvest in season, since the soil is very rich below. And <lb/>
              there is a haven with a good station, where there is no need <lb/>
              of cable, nor to cast anchors, nor to bind the halsers, but driv­ <lb/>
              ing in to remain so long, until the mind of the sailors should <lb/>
              excite them, and the winds should blow. But at the head of <lb/>
              the haven flows clear water, a fountain from under a cave; <lb/>
              and around poplars spring up. There we sailed, and some <lb/>
              deity conducted us through the dark night; nor did it appear <lb/>
              so as to be seen. For there was a dense mist about the <lb/>
              ships, nor did the moon shine from heaven, for it was <lb/>
              covered with clouds; from thence no one beheld the island <lb/>
              with his eyes ; nor did we perceive the long waves rolling to <lb/>
              the beach, before the well-benched ships struck against it. <lb/>
              But when the ships struck, we took down all the sails, and we <lb/>
              ourselves disembarked upon the shore of the sea; there hav­ <lb/>
              ing fallen asleep, we awaited divine morning. But when the <lb/>
              mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, appeared, admiring the <lb/>
              island we went round about it. And the nymphs, the daugh­ <lb/>
              ters of Ægis-beari ng Jove, roused the mountain-dwelling <lb/>
              goats, that my companions might take their meal. Imme­ <lb/>
              diately we took our bent bows and long-pointed javelins from <lb/>
              the ships ; and arrayed in three bands, we struck them ; and the <lb/>
              deity straightway gave us a strength-recruiting prey. Twelve <note type="footnote"> thins, <foreign xml:lang="grc">έλάχεια</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="grc">έλαχίστη</foreign>. There is, however, great uncertainty both <lb/>

              ships indeed followed me, and to each nine goats were allot­ <lb/>
              ted ; and they selected ten for me alone. Thus, then, during <lb/>
              the whole day, until the setting sun, we sat feasting on much <lb/>
              flesh and sweet wine. For the ruby wine was not yet ex­ <lb/>
              pended from the ships, but was in [them] : for each of us drew <lb/>
              much in kegs, when we captured the sacred citadel of the <lb/>
              Ciconians. And we looked to the land of the Cyclops, who <lb/>
              were near, and [perceived] 18 smoke, and their voice, and that <lb/>
              of sheep and goats.19 But when the sun set and darkness <lb/>
              came on, then at length we went to rest on the shore of the <lb/>
              sea : but when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, ap­ <lb/>
              peared, then I, having made an assembly, spoke amongst all: <lb/>
              ' Do ye others, my beloved companions, now remain, but I, <lb/>
              with my own ship and my companions, will go, and make <lb/>
              trial of these men who they are, whether they are insolent, <lb/>
              and wild, nor just; or are hospitable, and their mind is god­ <lb/>
              like.' Thus having spoken, I embarked in my ship ; and com­ <lb/>
              manded my companions both to embark themselves, and to <lb/>
              loose the halsers. But they immediately embarked, and sat <lb/>
              down on the benches; and sitting in order, they smote the <lb/>
              hoary sea with their oars. But when indeed we came to the <lb/>
              country near at hand, there we beheld a cave on the extreme <lb/>
              part [of the land], near the sea, lofty covered with laurels; <lb/>
              there much cattle, both sheep and goats, were sleeping; and <lb/>
              around a lofty hall was built with stones dug out of the earth, <lb/>
              and tall pines, and lofty-tressed oaks. There a monstrous man <lb/>
              was sleeping, who was pasturing his cattle alone at a distance <lb/>
              nor did he herd with others, but being apart (by himself) he <lb/>
              kenned lawless things. And truly he was a monstrous prodigy ; <lb/>
              nor was he like unto a mail who feeds on bread, but unto the <lb/>
              woody top of lofty mountains, when it appears alone [separated] <lb/>
              from others. Then indeed I ordered my other beloved com­ <lb/>
              panions to remain there near the ship, and to draw up the ship <lb/>
              but I, having chosen twelve the best of my companions, went. <lb/>

              in a satchel; for my noble mind immediately conjectured, that <lb/>
              a man would come endued with great might, wild, not well <lb/>
              acquainted with justice, nor rights. And we quickly reached <lb/>
              the cave, nor did we find him within ; but he was pasturing <lb/>
              his cattle in the rich pasture. And coming to the cave we <lb/>
              regarded every thing; his presses indeed were filled with <lb/>
              cheeses, and his pens were straightened with lambs and kids <lb/>
              and each were shut up separate; the older ones apart, and <lb/>
              the middle-aged apart, and again the tender ones21 apart; <lb/>
              and all his vessels swam with cream, his milk pails, and bowls, <lb/>
              wrought, into which he milked. Then my companions first <lb/>
              of all besought me with words, that we should go back, hav­ <lb/>
              ing taken some of his cheeses ; but afterwards, quickly driving <lb/>
              kids and lambs from the pens to the swift ship, to sail over <lb/>
              the briny water. But I did not obey them, (it would indeed <lb/>
              have been much better,) in order that I might both see him, <lb/>
              and whether he would give me hospitable presents. Nor <lb/>
              was he about to be, when he appeared, agreeable to my <lb/>
              companions. But there having lighted a fire we sacrificed; <lb/>
              and we too taking of the cheeses eat; and we waited for <lb/>
              him, sitting within until he came, having pastured [his <lb/>
              flocks] ; but he was bearing a vast weight of dry wood, that <lb/>
              it might serve as a light for him at supper.22 And throwing <lb/>
              it without the cave, he made a clamour ; and we, afraid, rushed <figure type="illustration">

              to the innermost part of the cave. But lie drove all the <lb/>
              fatted flocks, whatever he milked, into the wide cave, but the <lb/>
              males he left at the door, both rams and goats, outside the deep <lb/>
              hall. But then lifting up a large barrier on high, he fixed it, <lb/>
              of great weight: two and twenty good wains, with four wheels, <lb/>
              would not have moved it from the threshold, such a lofty23 <lb/>
              rock did he place at the door. And sitting down he milked <lb/>
              the sheep and bleating goats all rightly, and he set its young <lb/>
              one under each. But immediately, having thickened half of <lb/>
              the white milk, collecting it into woven sieves he laid it aside ; <lb/>
              and then he put half in vessels, that it might be for him to <lb/>
              drink when he wished, and might be useful at supper. But <lb/>
              after he had hastened in performing his employments, then <lb/>
              he lighted a fire, and saw and inquired of us :</p>
          <p>" ' O strangers, who are ye ? from whence do ye sail over <lb/>
            the moist ways ? Whether on account of some business, or do <lb/>
            ye wander in vain ? as robbers over the sea, who wander, ex­ <lb/>
            posing their lives, bringing evil to foreigners.'</p>
          <p>" Thus he spoke ; but our dear heart was broken down, fear­ <lb/>
            ing his heavy voice, and him a monster. But even so, answering <lb/>
            him with words, I addressed him : ' We Grecians, wandering <lb/>
            from Troy with all kinds of winds over the mighty ridge of the <lb/>
            sea, on returning home, have come another journey, by other <lb/>
            ways; so perhaps Jove wished to contrive. But we profess <lb/>
            ourselves to be the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, <lb/>
            whose renown, now at least, is the greatest under heaven : for <lb/>
            he has sacked so mighty a city, and destroyed [so] many people ; <lb/>
            but we coming to thy knees supplicate thee, if thou wouldst <lb/>
            afford us hospitable entertainment, or otherwise wouldst give <lb/>
            us a present, which is the right of strangers. But revere the <lb/>
            gods, O best one ; for we are thy suppliants. And hospitable <lb/>
            Jove, who attends upon strangers to be pitied, is the avenger <lb/>
            of suppliants and stranger,.,</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; but he answered me again with a cruel <lb/>
            mind: ' Ye are foolish, O stranger, or have come from a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, who command me either to fear or avoid the gods ; for <lb/>
            the Cyclops care not for Ægis-bearing Jove, nor the blessed <lb/>
            gods; since we are much superior to them. Nor would I, <lb/>
            avoiding the hatred of Jove, spare either thee or thy com- <note type="footnote"> 23 Literally, "sun-traversed." Virgo Æn. vii. 211, " saxo occultabat <lb/>

            panions, if my mind does not exhort me. But tell me, where, <lb/>
            when thou earnest, hast thou kept thy well-worked ship; <lb/>
            whether some where on the extreme part of the island, or <lb/>
            near, in order that I may know.'</p>
          <p>" Thus he spoke, trying me; nor did he escape me who <lb/>
            ken many things, but I addressed him in return with deceit­ <lb/>
            ful words: ' Earth-shaking Neptune has broken my ship, <lb/>
            dashing it against rocks, at the limits of thy land, driving it <lb/>
            against a headland: and a wind brought it from the sea; <lb/>
            but I with these escaped from bitter destruction.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; but he answered me not at all with his <lb/>
            cruel mind; but he rushing, threw his hands on my com­ <lb/>
            panions, and snatching two together, like whelps, he dashed <lb/>
            them against the earth, and the brains flowed out on the <lb/>
            ground, and bedewed the earth. And cutting these up, limb <lb/>
            by limb, he made ready supper: and he eat like a mountain- <lb/>
            nurtured lion, nor did he leave entrails or flesh, or marrowy <lb/>
            bones. But we weeping held up our hands to Jove, behold­ <lb/>
            ing the cruel deeds; and despair possessed our mind. But <lb/>
            when the Cyclops had filled his enormous belly, eating men's <lb/>
            flesh, and drinking pure milk after it, he lay within the cave, <lb/>
            stretched out in the midst of the sheep. I indeed took counsel <lb/>
            in my strong-hearted mind, going near, having drawn my <lb/>
            sharp sword from my thigh, to wound him in the breast, <lb/>
            where the vitals contain the liver, reaching him with my <lb/>
            hand, but another consideration hindered me. For there we <lb/>
            also should have perished in dreadful destruction; for we <lb/>
            should not have been able to thrust with our hands the im­ <lb/>
            mense stone from the lofty gates, which he placed at them. <lb/>
            Thus then mourning, we waited for divine morning. But <lb/>
            when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, appeared, <lb/>
            then he lighted a fire, and milked all his fine cattle rightly, and <lb/>
            set its young one under each. But after he had hastened in <lb/>
            performing his employments, he again snatching two together, <lb/>
            made ready his meal. And having banqueted he drove his <lb/>
            rich cattle out from the cave, easily taking away the large <lb/>
            gate; but afterwards he placed it back again, as if he were <lb/>
            placing the cover on a quiver. And with much clamour the <lb/>
            Cyclops turned his rich cattle towards the mountain ; but I <lb/>
            was left deeply planning evil things, if by any means I might <lb/>
            be revenged on him, and Minerva would give me glory. But <pb n="124"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="318-351"/> <lb/>
            this plan appeared to me in ray mind to be the best. For there <lb/>
            lay a vast club belonging to the Cyclops, near the fold, green, <lb/>
            of olive-wood ; this he had cut, that he might carry it when <lb/>
            dried; this when we saw it we likened it [to bej as large <lb/>
            as is the mast24 of a twenty-oared black merchant vessel, <lb/>
            wide, which passes over the mighty ridge ; so large it was in <lb/>
            length, and so large in width to behold. Of this I, standing <lb/>
            fear it, cut off as much as the length of a fathom, and gave it ? <lb/>
            to my companions, and ordered them to sharpen it at the end. <lb/>
            And they made it smooth ; and I standing near sharpened the <lb/>
            point, and immediately taking it, I burnt it in the hot fire; <lb/>
            and I laid it aside well, hiding it under the dung, which was <lb/>
            spread in very large quantities in the cave. But I ordered <lb/>
            the others to be settled by lot, whoever should dare with me, <lb/>
            raising the bar, to thrust it in his eye, when sweet sleep should <lb/>
            come upon him. And four were chosen by lot, whom even I <lb/>
            myself would have wished to choose, and I was chosen the fifth <lb/>
            after them. And in the evening he came acting the shepherd <lb/>
            to his beautiful-haired cattle ; and immediately he drove all his <lb/>
            rich sheep into the wide cave; nor did he leave them at all <lb/>
            outside the deep hall, either suspecting something, or perhaps <lb/>
            a deity so commanded him. And afterwards he put up the <lb/>
            large barrier, raising it on high, and sitting down he milked <lb/>
            the sheep and bleating goats, all rightly, and he set its young <lb/>
            one under each. But after he had hastened in performing <lb/>
            his employments, again snatching two together, he made ready <lb/>
            his supper; and then I addressed the Cyclops standing near <lb/>
            him, holding in my hands an ivy-wreathed 25 cup of black wine: <lb/>
            ' O Cyclops, take, drink wine, since thou hast eaten man's <lb/>
            flesh . that thou mayest know what this drink was which our <lb/>
            ship concealed ; but to thee I have brought a libation, if pity­ <lb/>
            ing me thou wouldst send me home ; but thou art raging in <lb/>
            a manner no longer to be endured. O cruel one, how dost <note type="footnote"> 24 A common hyperbole. So Milton, Par. Lost, i. 292 : <lb/>

            hereafter, since thou bust not acted rightly?'</p>
          <p>"Thus I spoke; but he received it and drank it off: and <lb/>
            he was greatly pleased on drinking the sweet liquor; and <lb/>
            he again asked of me a second time: ' Kindly give me more, <lb/>
            and forthwith tell me thy name, that I may give thee a hos­ <lb/>
            pitable gift, in which thou mayest rejoice. For the fruitful <lb/>
            plain bears for the Cyclops, wine that is produced from largo <lb/>
            clusters, and the shower from Jove nourishes it. But this is <lb/>
            what comes of ambrosia and nectar.'</p>
          <p>" Thus he spoke ; and I again gave him dark wine ; thrice <lb/>
            bearing it I gave it, and thrice he without thought quaffed <lb/>
            it. But when the wine came about the mind26 of the Cyclops, <lb/>
            then at length I addressed him with mild words: ' O Cyclops, <lb/>
            didst thou ask of me my name in common report ? I will tell <lb/>
            thee; but do thou give me a hospitable gift, as thou didst <lb/>
            promise: No-man 27 is my name ; my mother, and my father, <lb/>
            and all the rest of my companions call me No-man.'</p>
          <p>Dear spoke; but he again answered me with a cruel <lb/>
            mind the man I will eat the last after his companions, but <lb/>
            the of first; this indeed shall be thy hospitable present.'</p>
          <p>spoke, and reclining fell supine; but then he lay <lb/>
            slant g.his fat neck; and all-subduing sleep seized on him ; <lb/>
            and the wine and human gobbets f ushed out of his throat; <lb/>
            andche, heavy with wine, belched. And then I drove the bar <lb/>
            under a great quantity of cinders, until it was warm; and I <lb/>
            encouraged all my companions with words, lest any one fear­ <lb/>
            ing should decline it. But when the bar of olive wood was <lb/>
            soon about to be kindled in the fire, although it was green, for <lb/>
            it shone very much, then I carried it near him from the fire, <lb/>
            and my companions stood around; but a deity inspired them <lb/>
            with great courage. They, taking the bar of olive wood, <lb/>
            sharp at the point, thrust it into his eye; but I raised above <lb/>
            on high moved it round; as when any man bores a timber <lb/>
            plank with an auger, but they below, having bound it with <lb/>
            a thong on each side, move it, and it constantly runs round <lb/>
            thus taking the fire-tipt bar we moved it round in his eye, and <lb/>
            the blood flowed round it, being hot. And the vapour burnt <lb/>
            all his eye around, and his eye-brows, when the pupil was <note type="footnote"> 20 Or, as we should say, " got to his head." </note><note type="footnote"> 21 This is the only English translation that preserves the equivoque. </note> <pb n="126"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="390—428."/> <lb/>
            burning ; and the roots crackled with the fire. And as when <lb/>
            a brazier dips a large hatchet or axe in cold water, sounding <lb/>
            greatly, tempering it (for this is the strength of steel); so his <lb/>
            eye hissed around the bar of olive-wood. And he howled very <lb/>
            horribly; and the rock resounded about: and we fearing <lb/>
            hastened away; but he drew from his eye the bar polluted <lb/>
            with much blood; then raving he threw it from his hands. <lb/>
            But he called loudly to the Cyclops, who dwelt round about <lb/>
            him in caves throughout the windy promontories. And they, <lb/>
            having heard his voice, came from different places ; and stand­ <lb/>
            ing around the cave, inquired what afflicted him.</p>
          <p>"' How, Polyphemus, hast thou so much hurt thus cried <lb/>
            out through the ambrosial night, and made us sleepless ? Is <lb/>
            any one of mortals driving away thy sheep against thy will ? <lb/>
            or is some one killing thyself by deceit or by force?' But <lb/>
            them strong Polyphemus addressed in turn from the cave : '0 <lb/>
            my friends, No-man kills me by deceit, and not by force.' And <lb/>
            they answering addressed to him winged words :</p>
          <p>" 'If indeed no man treats thee, who art such<unclear>rove</unclear> with <lb/>
            violence, it is by no means possible to avoid a dis, , from <lb/>
            great Jove; yet do thou at least pray to thy fat . per king <lb/>
            Neptune.' up.</p>
          <p>" Thus they spoke departing; but my dear heart lai hed, <lb/>
            because my name and blameless counsel had deceived him. <lb/>
            But the Cyclops groaning, and travailing, on account oihis <lb/>
            pain, groping with his hands, took away the stone from the <lb/>
            door , but he sat within the gate, stretching out his hands, if <lb/>
            by chance he could lay hold of any one going out of the door <lb/>
            with the sheep ; for he expected that I was thus foolish in my <lb/>
            mind. But I consulted how it would be the best, if I could <lb/>
            discover any escape from death for my companions and for <lb/>
            myself; and I wove all kinds of deceit and craft, as concern­ <lb/>
            ing life, for a great evil was near at hand; and this counsel <lb/>
            seemed to me in my mind to be the best.</p>
          <p>" The male sheep were well-nurtured, thick-fleeced, beau <lb/>
            tiful, and large, having wool of a dark-violet colour: these I si­ <lb/>
            lently bound together with well-twisted osiers, (on which the <lb/>

            together; the one in the middle carried a man, but the other <lb/>
            two went on each side, preserving my companions. And <lb/>
            three sheep carried each man ; but I, for there was a ram, far <lb/>
            the best of all the cattle, laying hold of its back, having rolled <lb/>
            myself round under its shaggy belly ; but being twisted firmly <lb/>
            with my hands to the excellent wool, I held to it with an <lb/>
            enduring mind; thus then mourning we awaited the divine <lb/>
            morning.</p>
          <p>" But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, <lb/>
            appeared, then the male cattle immediately rushed to the pis­ <lb/>
            ture : and the unmilked females bleated through the pens, for <lb/>
            their teats were distended; but the master, afflicted with evil <lb/>
            pains, felt the backs of all the sheep which stood upright; <lb/>
            but, foolish one, he did not perceive that they30 were bound <lb/>
            under the breasts of the fleecy sheep. The last ram of the <lb/>
            cattle was going out of the door, weighed down with the thick <lb/>
            wool, and with me who planned crafty things; laying hold of <lb/>
            this, strong Polyphemus addressed him :</p>
          <p>" ' Dear ram, why hast thou come thus the last of the cattle <lb/>
            out of the cave ? Before thou by no means earnest left behind by <lb/>
            the sheep, but much the first thou didst pasture upon the tender <lb/>
            flowers of grass, stalking with large steps ;31 and first reached <lb/>
            the streams of rivers ; and in the evening thou didst desire to <lb/>
            return first to the stall; now on the contrary thou art the last <lb/>
            of all ; dost thou regret the eye of thy master ? which an evil <lb/>
            man has blinded, with his troublesome companions, having <lb/>
            subdued my mind with wine, No-man, whom I think has not <lb/>
            yet escaped destruction. But if thou hast a thought for- me, <lb/>
            and wast able to speak, tell me where he avoids my strength; <lb/>
            then in truth the brain of him dashed here and there through <lb/>
            the cave should flow on the ground; and my heart would <lb/>
            rest from the evils which No-man, a fellow of no value, has <lb/>
            brought upon me.'</p>
          <p>"Thus speaking, he sent away the ram from him out of <lb/>
            the door. And coming a little way from the cave and the <lb/>
            hall, I first loosed myself from under the rani, and loosed my <lb/>
            companions. And we quickly drove the long-legged cattle, <lb/>
            rich with fat, enclosing many, until we came to the ship; <lb/>
            and we, who had escaped death, appeared welcome to our dear <note type="footnote"> 30 The companions of Ulysses. </note><note type="footnote"> 31 Or perhaps, as we should say, " stepping out well." </note> <pb n="128"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="468—504"/> <lb/>
            companions ; but weeping they mourned for the others. But <lb/>
            I did not allow them to weep, but I nodded to each with my <lb/>
            eyebrows ; and I ordered them quickly, lifting the many beau­ <lb/>
            tiful-haired cattle into the ship, to sail over the briny main. <lb/>
            They immediately embarked and sat down on the benches, <lb/>
            and sitting in order they smote the hoary sea with their oars. <lb/>
            But when I was so far distant, as one makes himself heard <lb/>
            shouting out, then I addressed the Cyclops with reproaches:</p>
          <p>"'0 Cyclops, thou wast not indeed destined to eat the <lb/>
            companions of a weak man in thy hollow cave, with strong <lb/>
            might. But truly thou wert destined to find thy evil deeds, <lb/>
            thou cruel one! Since thou didst not fear to eat strangers <lb/>
            in thine house; therefore Jove and the other gods have been <lb/>
            revenged upon thee.'</p>
          <p>" ' Thus I spoke; but he immediately was more wrath in <lb/>
            his heart; having broken off the top of a large mountain he <lb/>
            hurled it, and threw it before the black-prowed ship, land it <lb/>
            wanted little to reach the 'extreme part of the rudder;] and <lb/>
            the sea was disturbed by the descending rock ; and a refluent <lb/>
            wave, an inundation from the sea, immediately bore the vessel <lb/>
            towards the shore, and made it approach so as to reach the <lb/>
            continent. But I, seizing with my hands a long pole, thrust it <lb/>
            away ; and exhorting my companions, I commanded them to lay <lb/>
            on their oars, that we might escape from evil, nodding with my. <lb/>
            head ; and they, falling forward, rowed. But when at length <lb/>
            we were twice32 as far distant, having passed over the sea, then <lb/>
            too I addressed the Cyclops ; and my companions around hin­ <lb/>
            dered me, one here, one there, with mild words : ' O foolish one,­ <lb/>
            why dost thou wish to irritate a fierce man ? who even now <lb/>
            has hurled a bolt into the sea, and driven our ship again to <lb/>
            the shore, and surely we thought that we should perish there. <lb/>
            But if he heard any one speaking or callin g out, he would <lb/>
            dash our heads together, and our ship's planks, striking us <lb/>
            with the rough marble; for he throws so far.'</p>
          <p>" Thus they spoke, but they did not persuade my strong- <lb/>
            hearted mind,but I again addressed him with wrathful feelings : <lb/>
            ' O Cyclops, if any one of mortal men should inquire of thee <lb/>
            about the unseemly blindness of thine eye, say that Ulysses <note type="footnote"> 32 " The seeming incongruity of this line with line 473, is reconciled <lb/>
            by supposing that Ulysses exerted his voice, naturally loud, in an extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary manner on this second occasion." Cowper. </note> <pb n="129"/>

            the sacker of cities, the son of Laertes, who possesses a house <lb/>
            in Ithaca, blinded thee.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke ; but he wailing answered me in discourse <lb/>
            ' Alas, surely the oracles spoken of old are come upon me. <lb/>
            There was a certain prophet here, a good and great man, <lb/>
            Telemus Eurymedes, who excelled in prophesying, and lie <lb/>
            grew old prophesying amongst the Cyclops. He told me that <lb/>
            all these things would hereafter be accomplished, that I should <lb/>
            be deprived of my sight by the hands of Ulysses. But I have <lb/>
            been still expecting that some large and beautiful man would <lb/>
            come here, clad in mighty strength. But now, one who is <lb/>
            little, worth nothing, and weak, has bereft me of my sight, <lb/>
            after he had subdued me with wine. But come hither, Ulysses, <lb/>
            that I may give thee hospitable presents, and may urge illus­ <lb/>
            trious Neptune to give thee an escort; for I am his son, and <lb/>
            lie professes to be my father: but he, if he shall be willing, <lb/>
            will cure me, nor any other either of the blessed gods or mor­ <lb/>
            tal men.'</p>
          <p>" Thus he spoke ; but I answering addressed him : ' I wish <lb/>
            indeed I could send thee within the house of Pluto, having <lb/>
            deprived thee of thy soul and life ; so not even Neptune will <lb/>
            cure thine eye.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke ; but he immediately prayed to King Nep­ <lb/>
            tune, stretching forth his hands to the starry heaven : ' Hear <lb/>
            me, O earth-containing, azure-haired Neptune, if I am truly <lb/>
            thine, and thou dost profess to be my sire, grant that Ulysses, <lb/>
            the sacker of cities, [the son of Laertes, who possesses a house <lb/>
            in Ithaca,] may not reach home. But if it is a destiny for <lb/>
            him to behold his friends, and to come to his well-built house, <lb/>
            and his own paternal land, may he come late to his cost, hav­ <lb/>
            ing lost all his companions, on a foreign ship, and may he find <lb/>
            calamities in his home.'</p>
          <p>" Thus he spoke praying; and he of azure hair heard him. <lb/>
            But he immediately raising a much larger stone, sent it whirl­ <lb/>
            ing it round ; and he exerted enormous strength. And he <lb/>
            hurled it behind the dark-prowed ship, and it wanted little to <lb/>
            reach the extreme part of the rudder ; and the sea was dis­ <lb/>
            turbed by the descending rock. But it the wave bore for­ <lb/>
            ward, and made it approach so as to reach the continent. <lb/>
            But when at length we reached the island where the other <lb/>
            well-benched ships remained together, and our companiona <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="545—566. x. 1—8."/> <lb/>
            eat around, weeping, still expecting us, when we came there, <lb/>
            we drew our ship up on the sands, and we ourselves disem­ <lb/>
            barked on the shore of the sea. And taking the cattle of the <lb/>
            Cyclops from the hollow ship, we divided them, so that no <lb/>
            one might go deprived of an equal share. But when the <lb/>
            cattle were being divided, my well-greaved companions gave <lb/>
            the ram to me alone, as an especial mark of distinction; and <lb/>
            sacrificing it on the shore to black-cloudy Jove, the son of <lb/>
            Saturn, who rules over all, I burnt its thighs : but he regarded <lb/>
            not my sacrifices, but meditated how all my well-benched <lb/>
            ships and my beloved companions might perish.</p>
          <p>" Thus then during the whole day until the setting sun we <lb/>
            sat feasting on quantities of flesh and sweet wine: but when <lb/>
            the sun went down, and darkness came on, then we slept on <lb/>
            the shore of the sea. But when the mother of dawn, rosy- <lb/>
            fingered morning, appeared, then I exhorting my companions <lb/>
            commanded them to embark, and to loose the halsers ; and <lb/>
            they quickly embarked and sat down on the benches. And <lb/>
            sitting in order they smote the hoary sea with their oars. <lb/>
            And from thence we sailed forward sorrowing in our heart, <lb/>
            rejoicing [at our escape] from death, having lost our dear <lb/>
            companions.</p>

          <p>Ulysses continues his narrative, relating his arrival at the island of Æolus, <lb/>
            who gave him the winds bound up in a skin ; which bis companions un­ <lb/>
            tied, while he was asleep, having mistaken it for gold ; and hence his ships <lb/>
            were driven by the winds back to Æolus, who rejected him as au impious <lb/>
            person. He then tells of his arrival amongst the Læstrygonians, who de­ <lb/>
            stroyed all his fleet, except his own ship with its crew. Thence he came <lb/>
            to the island of Circe, who transformed half his sailors into swine ; but, <lb/>
            by the assistance of Mercury, he compelled the goddess to restore them to <lb/>
            their former shape. After spending a whole year with Circe, by her ad­ <lb/>
            vice, he prepares to go to the infernal regions.</p>
          <p>AND we arrived at the Æolian island, and here dwelt <lb/>
            Æolus, son of Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods, in a float­ <lb/>
            ing 1 island; but around the whole of it there is a brazen <note type="footnote"> Or " a circum navigable island," which is preferred by Riccius and <lb/>

            wall, not to be broken ;2 and a smooth rock runs up it; and <lb/>
            twelve children of him are born in his palace ; six daughters, <lb/>
            and six sons in full vigour. There he gave his daughters3 to <lb/>
            be wives to his sons. They always banquet near their dear <lb/>
            father and their good mother; and near them lie many dain <lb/>
            ties. And the sweet-odoured dwelling sounds around the <lb/>
            hall during the days, and at nights they sleep again near their <lb/>
            chaste wives, on tapestry, and on compact beds : and we came <lb/>
            indeed to their city and beautiful houses. And he entertained <lb/>
            me during a whole month, and inquired every thing, of Ilium, <lb/>
            and the ships of the Argives, and the return of the Grecians <lb/>
            and I told him all things rightly. But when at length I <lb/>
            asked for a journey, and desired him to send me, he did not <lb/>
            at all refuse, but prepared an escort, and having skinned a <lb/>
            bladder of an ox of nine years old, he gave it me, in which <lb/>
            he bound the ways of the blustering4 winds; for the son of <lb/>
            Saturn made him the keeper of the winds, both to still and <lb/>
            to raise whichever he wishes. And he bound it in the <lb/>
            hollow ship with a shining silver rope, that not even a little <lb/>
            breath might escape. But for me he sent forward the blast <lb/>
            of the west wind to blow, that it might waft both my ships <lb/>
            and ourselves. Nor was he destined5 to accomplish it; for <lb/>
            we perished by our own infatuation. <note type="footnote"> 463, seems to prefer the common explanation. But a passage of Dionys. <lb/>
            Piereg. 461, sqq., evidently imitated from Homer, favours Ernesti's inter­ <lb/>

          <p>" For nine days however we sailed both nights and day ; <lb/>
            but on the tenth our paternal fields now appeared, and we at <lb/>
            length beheld those who were kindling fires, being near at <lb/>
            hand. Then sweet sleep came upon me wearied ; for I al­ <lb/>
            ways guided the rudder of the ship; nor did I give it up to <lb/>
            any other of my companions, that we might more quickly <figure type="illegible">

              who was near:</p>

            plished the same journey, are returning home, having empty <lb/>
            hands. And now Æolus, gratifying him on account of his <lb/>
            friendship, has given him these things : but come, let us <lb/>
            quickly see what these things are, how much gold and silver <lb/>
            is in the skin.’</p>
          <p>‘• Thus they spoke ; and the evil counsel of my companions <lb/>
            prevailed, they loosed the skin, and all the winds rushed out. <lb/>
            The storm immediately snatching them bore them mourning <lb/>
            into the sea, from their paternal land: but I waking, meditated <lb/>
            in my blameless mind, whether, falling from the ship, I should <lb/>
            perish in the sea, or should endure it in silence, and still be <lb/>
            amongst the living. But I endured it, and remained ; and I <lb/>
            lay, having covered myself in the ship: but they were again <lb/>
            borne by the evil tempest of the wind to the Æolian island: <lb/>
            and my companions mourned. There we went on shore, and <lb/>
            drew water: and my companions immediately took supper <lb/>
            near the swift ships. But when we had tasted of both meat <lb/>
            and drink, then I, having chosen both a herald and companion. <lb/>
            went to the illustrious house of Æolus ; but him I found <lb/>
            feasting near his wife and his children. But when we came <note type="footnote"> (vs. 27) in this passage. The commentators, even Loewe, are any thing <lb/>
            but clear on the subject. I think it simply amounts to this. In vs. 26, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῆάς τε</foreign> cai <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτούς</foreign> means, " the ships, and us the sailors," the cognate <lb/>

            27, <unclear>αὐτν</unclear> is loosely used, because Ulysses speaks of the conduct of the <lb/>
            majority, not of himself. </note> <pb n="133"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="61—87."/> <lb/>
            to the house, we sat down at the door on the threshold; and <lb/>
            they were astonished in their mind, and inquired:</p>
          <p>" ' How didst thou come, O Ulysses ? what evil deity has <lb/>
            pressed upon thee ? certainly we sent thee away carefully, <lb/>
            that thou mightest come to thy country, and house, and <lb/>
            wherever is agreeable to thee.'</p>
          <p>" Thus they spoke; but I addressed them, sorrowing in my <lb/>
            heart. ‘ Both evil companions have injured me, and in ad­ <lb/>
            dition to these, unhappy sleep; but cure me, O friends, for <lb/>
            the power is with you.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke soothing them with mild words; but they <lb/>
            became dumb; and their father answered me in discourse: <lb/>
            ' Away with thee quickly from the island, thou vilest of the <lb/>
            living ! for it is not lawful for me to receive or escort away <lb/>
            that man, who indeed is hated by the blessed gods. Away ; <lb/>
            since thou art come hither, hated by the gods.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus having spoken, he sent me away from the house <lb/>
            mourning heavily. And from thence we sailed onward, sor­ <lb/>
            rowing in our heart. But the mind of the men was wearied <lb/>
            by the difficult rowing, through our own folly ; since there no <lb/>
            longer appeared an escort.</p>
          <p>" For six days however we sailed both night and day; <lb/>
            but on the seventh we came to the lofty city of Lamas, spa­ <lb/>
            cious6 Læstrigonia, where a shepherd on going in calls a <lb/>
            shepherd, but he going out listens. There a man who has no <lb/>
            sleep would receive double pay, the one for feeding herds, <lb/>
            the other for pasturing white sheep: for the ways7 of night <lb/>
            and of day are near. There when we came to the famous <note type="footnote"> 6 Or, " having a large gate but the Scholiast, " large or extensive, <lb/>
            having its gates far apart." See Loewe. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 There is much difference of opinion respecting this passage: the <lb/>
            Scholiast understands it " that the nightly and daily pastures are near the <lb/>
            city." Chapman remarks, " some have understood, that the days in that <lb/>
            region are long, and the nights short; so that Homer intends, that the <lb/>
            equinoctial is there (for how else is the course of day and night near or <lb/>
            equal ?). But therefore the nights-man hath his double hire, being as long <lb/>
            about his charge as the other ; and the night being more dangerous. And if <lb/>
            the day were so long, why should the nights-man be preferred in wages ?" <lb/>
            Cowper says, " It is supposed by Eustathius, that the pastures being in­ <lb/>
            fested by gadflies and other noxious insects in the day-time, they drove <lb/>
            their sheep a-field in the morning, which by their wool were defended <lb/>
            from them, and their cattle in the evening, when the insects had with­ <lb/>
            drawn." This latter interpretation seems the most probable, and has been <lb/>
            followed by Riccius and Loewe. </note> <pb n="134"/>

            haven, around which there was a lofty rock, continual on <lb/>
            both sides; and prominent shores opposite to one another <lb/>
            project at the mouth: but the entrance is narrow: there in­ <lb/>
            deed they all kept their ships, rowed on both sides, within. <lb/>
            They indeed were bound within the hollow haven, near one <lb/>
            another; for in it the wave was never raised, neither large <lb/>
            nor small ; for there was a white calm around. But I alon <lb/>
            kept my black ship out, there at the extreme part, having <lb/>
            bound the cables from the rock.</p>
          <p>" And I stood, ascending a rugged promontory; there in­ <lb/>
            deed appeared neither the works of oxen nor of men, but we <lb/>
            saw the smoke only rushing forth from the earth. Then I <lb/>
            sent forward my companions to go on and inquire what men <lb/>
            they were, eating food upon the earth, choosing two men, <lb/>
            giving them a herald as a third. But they, having disem <lb/>
            barked, went the smooth way, by which waggons carried <lb/>
            wood to the city from the lofty mountains. And they met <lb/>
            a damsel before the city, carrying water, the strong daughter <lb/>
            of the Læstrygonian Antiphates. She went down to the fair- <lb/>
            flowing fountain Artacia ; for they carried water from thence <lb/>
            to the city. But they standing near addressed her, and in­ <lb/>
            quired of her, who was their king, and over whom he ruled. <lb/>
            But she immediately showed the lofty-roofed house of her <lb/>
            sire. And when they entered the illustrious dwelling, they <lb/>
            found the mistress as mighty as the summit of a mountain, <lb/>
            and they shuddered at her. But she quickly called illustrious <lb/>
            Antiphates, her husband, from the forum, who indeed devised <lb/>
            miserable destruction for them : immediately snatching up <lb/>
            one of my companions, he prepared his meal; but the two <lb/>
            rushing away in flight came to the ships. But he made a <lb/>
            clamour through the city ; and the strong Læstrygonians came <lb/>
            rushing one after another in great numbers, not like unto <lb/>
            men, but giants ; who pelted them with weighty stones from <lb/>
            the rocks: and soon an evil sound arose at the ships of the <lb/>
            men who perished, and of the ships broken at the same time. <lb/>
            And sticking them through like fish, they carried away their sad <lb/>
            feast. Whilst they destroyed those within the deep haven, in <lb/>
            the mean time I, having drawn my sharp sword from my thigh, <lb/>
            with it cut the cables of the azure-prowed ship. And quickly <lb/>
            exhorting my companions, I ordered them to throw themselves <lb/>
            upon their oars, that we might escape from evil. And they <pb n="135"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="131—169."/> <lb/>
            all turned up the sea [with their oars] together, dreading de­ <lb/>
            struction. And my ship gladly fled the lofty rocks into the sea ; <lb/>
            but the others perished there together. But from thence we <lb/>
            sailed onward, sorrowing in our heart, glad [at our escape] <lb/>
            from death, [but sorry at] having lost our dear companions.8 <lb/>
            And we came to the island Ææa; but fair-haired Circe, a <lb/>
            clever goddess, possessing human speech, dwelt there own <lb/>
            sister to all-wise9 Æætas ; and both were born from the Sun <lb/>
            who gives light to mortals, and from a mother Perse, whom <lb/>
            Ocean begot as his daughter. But there we were led up on the <lb/>
            shore silently in the ship to the ship-receiving haven ; and some <lb/>
            god conducted us. There then disembarking, we lay two <lb/>
            days and two nights, consuming our mind with labour and <lb/>
            grief together.</p>
          <p>“ But when at length the fair-haired morn produced the <lb/>
            third day, then I, taking my spear and sharp sword, quickly <lb/>
            went up from the ship to a place of look-out, if by any means <lb/>
            I could perceive the works of men, and could hear their voice. <lb/>
            And I stood, having ascended a rugged promontory. And there <lb/>
            appeared to me smoke from the wide-wayed earth, in the <lb/>
            palace of Circe, through the dense thickets and wood. And <lb/>
            then I meditated in my soul and in my mind to go and in­ <lb/>
            quire, when I beheld the black smoke. But thus, on consider­ <lb/>
            ing, it seemed to me to be better that I should, first going to <lb/>
            the swift ship and the shore of the sea, give a supper to my <lb/>
            companions, and send them on to inquire. But when I was <lb/>
            now coming near to the ship rowed on both sides, then some <lb/>
            one of the gods pitied me, who was alone, who sent a large <lb/>
            lofty-horned stag into my very path: it came down to the <lb/>
            river from the pasture in the wood, to drink (for already the <lb/>
            strength of the sun seized hold of him): but I struck him, as <lb/>
            he was going out, at the spine in the middle of the baek : and <lb/>
            the brazen spear passed right through him; and he fell moan­ <lb/>
            ing in the dust, and life fled away. But I stepping upon <lb/>
            him, drew the brazen spear out of the wound ; again reclining <lb/>
            it on the earth, I left it: but I drew twigs and osiers, and <lb/>
            having woven a well-twisted cable on both sides as long as <lb/>
            an ell, I bound together the feet of the terrible monster.10 <lb/>
            And I went to the black ship, carrying it across my neck, <note type="footnote"> 9 Referring to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκαχήμενοι ἢτορ</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote">9 See Loewe on i. 52 </note><note type="footnote"> 10 These words appear merely to refer to its magnitude. </note> <pb n="136"/>

            leaning upon my spear, since it was by no means possible to <lb/>
            carry it on my shoulder with one hand, for it was a very large <lb/>
            beast: and I threw it down before the ship; and I aroused <lb/>
            my companions with mild words, standing near each man:</p>
          <p>" ‘ O my friends, we shall not yet go down to the house of <lb/>
            Pluto, although grieving, before the fated day comes upon <lb/>
            [us]. But come, whilst there is meat and drink in the swift <lb/>
            ship, let us be mindful of food, nor be wasted with hunger.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke ; and they quickly obeyed my words ; and <lb/>
            having uncovered the stag near the shore of the sea, they ad­ <lb/>
            mired it; for it was a very large beast. But when they were <lb/>
            delighted, beholding it with their eyes, having washed their <lb/>
            hands they get ready a most glorious banquet. Thus then <lb/>
            during the whole day, until the setting sun, we sat feasting <lb/>
            upon abundance of flesh and sweet wine. But when the sun <lb/>
            set and darkness came on, then we slept on the shore of the <lb/>
            sea. But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, <lb/>
            appeared, then I, having made an assembly, spoke amongst <lb/>
            all:</p>
          <p>" ‘ Hear my words, O companions, although suffering evil <lb/>
            things. O my friends, since we know not where is the west, <lb/>
            nor where the morning, nor where the sun that gives light to <lb/>
            mortals descends beneath the earth, nor where he rises up <lb/>
            again ; yet let us quickly consider, if there is still any coun­ <lb/>
            sel remaining ; but I do not think that there is. For, having <lb/>
            ascended a rugged promontory, I beheld the island, around <lb/>
            which the boundless sea forms a crown ;11 but it lies low: <lb/>
            and I saw smoke in the middle with mine eyes through the <lb/>
            dense thickets and the wood.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus I spoke; but their dear heart was broken, when <lb/>
            they remembered the deeds of the Læstrygonian Antiphates, <lb/>
            and the violence of the strong-hearted12 cannibal Cyclops. <lb/>
            And they wept piercingly, shedding the warm tear. But there <lb/>
            was not any advantage to them wailing. And I numbered all <lb/>
            my well-greaved companions into two parties, and I gave a <lb/>
            chieftain to both. I commanded one party, and godlike Eury­ <lb/>
            lochus the other. And we quickly shook lots in a brazen <lb/>
            helmet, and the lot of magnanimous Eurylochus leaped out. <lb/>
            And he hastened to go, and with him two and twenty com­ <lb/>
            panions weeping; and they left us mourning behind. And <note type="footnote"> 11 i. e. encircles. </note> <note type="footnote"> " An epithet but indifferently chosen. </note> <pb n="137"/>

            they found the house of Circe built in the woods with polished <lb/>
            stones, in a lofty situation. And around her were mountain <lb/>
            wolves, and lions, which she herself had tamed, since she had <lb/>
            given [them] evil drugs. Nor did they rush against the men, <lb/>
            but they stood up fawning around them with their long tails. <lb/>
            As when dogs fawn about their master when coming from a <lb/>
            feast, for he always brings things soothing to their mind. So <lb/>
            the strong-hoofed wolves and lions fawned13 around them ; but <lb/>
            they were afraid when they beheld the terrible monsters. And <lb/>
            they stood in the gates of the fair-haired goddess: and they <lb/>
            heard Circe within singing with a beautiful voice, busied over <lb/>
            a large immortal web : such as are the slender, graceful, and <lb/>
            illustrious works of goddesses. But Polites, the chief of men, <lb/>
            began speaking to them, who was the most familiar of my <lb/>
            companions, and the most prudent:</p>
          <p>“ ‘ O my friends, some one indeed within is going over the <lb/>
            great web and singing beautifully, (and all the pavement <lb/>
            sounds around,) either a goddess or woman ; but let us quickly <lb/>
            shout out.’</p>
          <p>" Thus then he spoke ; and they calling shouted out. And <lb/>
            she immediately coming out opened the shining doors and <lb/>
            calls them; but they all followed together through their ig­ <lb/>
            norance: but Eurylochus remained, thinking that it was a <lb/>
            stratagem. And leading them in, she made them sit down on <lb/>
            benches and thrones. And she mixed cheese and meal and <lb/>
            pale honey with Pramnian wine for them; but she mingled <lb/>
            grievous drugs in the food, that they might altogether forget <lb/>
            their paternal land. But when she had given it and they <lb/>
            drank it off, immediately then striking them with a rod, she <lb/>
            shut them up in styes. But they had the heads, and voice, <lb/>
            and hairs, and body of swine; but their understanding was <lb/>
            firm, as before. Thus they weeping were shut up: but Circe <lb/>
            threw near them mast and acorn, and cornel fruit to eat, such <lb/>
            things as ground-wallowing swine always eat. But Eurylo­ <lb/>
            chus immediately came to the swift black ship, to tell the news <lb/>
            of his companions, and of their bitter fate. Nor was he able <lb/>
            to speak out any word, although desirous, afflicted at heart <lb/>
            with great grief: and his eyes were filled with tears, and his <lb/>
            mind thought of mourning. But when we all marvelled, in­ <note type="footnote"> " Literally, " wagged their tails." This is the proper meaning of <unclear/> <lb/>

            quiring of him, then he related the destruction of his other <lb/>

          <p>“‘ We went, as thou didst command, through the thickets, <lb/>
            illustrious Ulysses; we found in the dells a beautiful house <lb/>
            built [with polished stones, in a conspicuous place]. And <lb/>
            there some one, either goddess or woman, going over the great <lb/>
            web, sang piercingly: but they calling shouted out: and she <lb/>
            immediately coming out, opened the shining doors, and invited <lb/>
            them ; and they all followed together through their ignorance ; <lb/>
            but I remained, thinking that it was some deceit. And they <lb/>
            all vanished together, nor did any one of them appear without; <lb/>
            but sitting down I watched a long time.'</p>
          <p>" Thus he spoke; but I girt my silver-hilted sword around <lb/>
            my shoulders, large, of brass ; and my bow around me. And <lb/>
            I immediately commanded him to lead the same way. But he <lb/>
            laying hold of my knees with both his hands entreated me, <lb/>
            land lamenting addressed to me winged words] :</p>
          <p>" ‘ Do not take me there against my will, O thou nourished <lb/>
            of Jove, but leave me here. For I know that neither thou thy­ <lb/>
            self wilt come back, nor wilt thou bring any other of thy <lb/>
            companions: but let us quickly fly with these; for yet we <lb/>
            may escape the evil day.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus he spoke ; but I answering addressed him: ‘ O Eury­ <lb/>
            lochus, do thou then remain here in this place eating and <lb/>
            drinking near the hollow black ship : but I will go, for strong <lb/>
            necessity comes upon me.'</p>
          <p>"Thus having spoken, I went up from the ship and the sea. <lb/>
            But when I was just going near the sacred dells, about to <lb/>
            reach the great dwelling of Circe skilled in many drugs, there <lb/>
            golden-wanded Mercury met me as I was coming to the house, <lb/>
            like unto a young man having the first down on his cheek, <lb/>
            whose youth is most graceful; and he laid hold of my hand, <lb/>
            and spoke and addressed me:</p>
          <p>“‘ Where thus, wretched one, art thou going alone, to no <lb/>
            purpose, through the wolds,14 being unacquainted with the <lb/>
            place ? but those thy companions are shut up in Circe's house, <lb/>
            like swine possessing many hiding-places. Whether dost thou <lb/>
            come hither to loose them ? I do not think that thou wilt <lb/>

            But come now, I will free thee and preserve thee from evils: <lb/>
            take this excellent drug, and keeping it, go to the house of <lb/>
            Circe, the power of which will ward off the evil day from you. <lb/>
            And I will tell you all the cunning tricks of Circe. She will <lb/>
            prepare a mixture for you, and will put drugs in the food. <lb/>
            But not even thus will she be able to charm you ; for the ex­ <lb/>
            cellent drug which I will give you, will not permit it: but I <lb/>
            will tell you every thing. When Circe strikes you with a long <lb/>
            rod, then do thou draw thy sharp sword from thy thigh, and <lb/>
            rush at Circe, as if desirous to kill her. But she crouching <lb/>
            in fear will exhort thee to lie down : then do thou no longer <lb/>
            refuse the bed of the goddess, that she may loose your com­ <lb/>
            panions and convey thee back thyself: but exhort her to swear a <lb/>
            great oath of the blessed gods, that she will not plan any other <lb/>
            evil harm for thee, nor make thee naked, weak, and unmanly.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus having spoken, the Argus-slayer gave me the remedy, <lb/>
            pulling it out of the earth, and he showed me its nature. It <lb/>
            was black in the root, and its flower was like unto milk; and <lb/>
            the gods call it Molu ; but it is difficult for mortal men to dig <lb/>
            up ; but the gods are able to do every thing. Then Mercury <lb/>
            departed to great Olympus, through the woody island: but I <lb/>
            went to the house of Circe; and my heart planned many <lb/>
            things as I went. And I stood at the gate of the fair-haired <lb/>
            goddess; there standing I called out, and the goddess heard <lb/>
            my voice. She immediately coming out, opened the shining <lb/>
            doors, and invited me : but I followed sorrowing in my heart. <lb/>
            And leading me in, she made me sit down on a silver-studded <lb/>
            throne, beautiful, variegated, and beneath my feet was a foot­ <lb/>
            stool. And she prepared a mixture for me in a golden cup, <lb/>
            that I might drink; and she put the drug in it, meditating <lb/>
            evil things in her mind. But when she gave it me, and I <lb/>
            drank it off, she did not soothe me any more ; striking me with <lb/>
            a rod, she spoke and said, ' Go now to the stye, lie with thine <lb/>
            other companions.'</p>
          <p>" Thus she spoke; but I, having drawn my sharp sword <lb/>
            from my thigh, rushed at Circe, as desiring to kill her. But <lb/>
            she, crying out loudly, ran under, and laid hold of my knees, <lb/>
            and lamenting addressed to me winged words:</p>
          <p>“ ‘ Who art thou ? from whence amongst men ? where are <lb/>
            thy city and parents ? Astonishment possesses me, that thou <lb/>
            wast not soothed, drinking these drugs. For not yet has any <pb n="140"/>

            other man sustained these drugs, whoever shall have drunk <lb/>
            them, and tlicy shall have first passed his lips : [but thou hast <lb/>
            some mind in thy breast which cannot be charmed.] Art <lb/>
            thou Ulysses with many turns, whom the golden-wanded Ar­ <lb/>
            gicide always told me would come, as he was returning from <lb/>
            Troy in a swift black ship ? But come now, place thy sword <lb/>
            in the sheath, and then we will ascend my bed, that being <lb/>
            mixed in the bed and in love, we may trust in one another.'</p>
          <p>" Thus she spoke, but I answering addressed her: ' O Circe, <lb/>
            how dost thou command me to be mild to thee, who hast made <lb/>
            my companions swine in thy palace ? But detaining me here, <lb/>
            planning deceit dost thou command me to go to thy chamber, <lb/>
            and to ascend thy bed, that thou mayest make me naked, <lb/>
            weak, and unmanly? I would not be willing to ascend thy <lb/>
            bed unless thou wouldst endure, O goddess, to swear a great <lb/>
            oath to me, that thou wik not devise any other evil harm <lb/>
            against me.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; and she immediately swore, as I com­ <lb/>
            manded: but when she had sworn and confirmed the oath, <lb/>
            then I ascended the beautiful bed of Circe.</p>
          <p>" And four handmaidens, who are her servants in the house, <lb/>
            were busy in the palace. But they indeed were sprung from <lb/>
            the fountains and from the groves, and from the sacred rivers, <lb/>
            which flow forth into the sea. One of them threw beautiful <lb/>
            blankets up on the thrones, purple above, but under she put <lb/>
            beautiful linen: another extended silver tables before the <lb/>
            thrones, and set upon them golden dishes: a third mixed <lb/>
            sweet honeyed wine in a silver bowl, and distributed golden <lb/>
            cups: but the fourth carried water, and lighted a great fire <lb/>
            under a large tripod ; and the water was warmed. But when <lb/>
            the water boiled in the shining brass, having put me in a <lb/>
            bath, she washed me from the large tripod, pouring [water] <lb/>
            pleasantly over my head and shoulders, until she took away <lb/>
            from my limbs mind-destroying labour; but when she had <lb/>
            both washed me and anointed me with rich oil, she threw a <lb/>
            beautiful cloak and garment around me, and leading me in, <lb/>
            seated me on a silver-studded throne, beautiful, variegated ; <lb/>
            and a footstool was under my feet. [But a handmaiden <lb/>
            fringing water in a beautiful golden ewer, poured it over a <lb/>
            silver cauldron, to wash in: and she spread a polished table <lb/>
            near. But the venerable housekeeper bringing food placed it <pb n="141"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="372—410."/> <lb/>
            near me, putting on many dainties, gratifying us as well as she <lb/>
            could from the stores at hand.] And she ordered me to eat, <lb/>
            but it did not please my mind: but I sat thinking upon other <lb/>
            things, and my mind brooded upon evils : but Circe, when she <lb/>
            perceived me sitting down, and not stretching out my hands <lb/>
            for food, but having violent grief in my mind, standing near, <lb/>
            she spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" ‘ Why thus, O Ulysses, dost thou sit down like unto one <lb/>
            that is dumb, consuming thy mind? and dost not touch food, <lb/>
            or drink ? dost thou think of some other stratagem ? It is no <lb/>
            longer fit that thou shouldst fear; for I have already sworn <lb/>
            a strong oath.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus she spoke ; but I in answer addressed her : O CircA, <lb/>
            what man, who is just, would endure to taste food and drink, <lb/>
            before he had redeemed his companions, and beheld them with <lb/>
            his eyes ? But if indeed thou dost kindly command me to <lb/>
            drink and to eat, loose them, that I may behold my beloved <lb/>
            companions with my eyes.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus I spoke ; and Circe went out from the palace, hold­ <lb/>
            ing a rod in her hand, and she opened the gates of the stye, <lb/>
            and drove them out, like unto swine of nine years old. They <lb/>
            then stood opposite: but she going through them, anointed <lb/>
            each with another drug. And the hairs flowed down from <lb/>
            their limbs, which the pernicious poison, which venerable <lb/>
            Circe gave them, had before produced : and they quickly be­ <lb/>
            came younger men than they were before, and much finer and <lb/>
            mightier to behold. But they knew me, and each clung to <lb/>
            me with their hands. And delightful mournings came upon <lb/>
            all, and resounded greatly through the house: and even the <lb/>
            goddess herself pitied us: and the divine one of goddesses <lb/>
            standing near me addressed [me] :</p>
          <p>“‘ O noble son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses, now <lb/>
            go to the swift ship, and to the, shore of the sea: first of all <lb/>
            lraw ye your ship to the shore, and lay up your possessions <lb/>
            and all your arms in caves: and do thou thyself come back, <lb/>
            and bring thy beloved companions.'</p>
          <p>" Thus she spoke ; but my noble mind was persuaded ; and <lb/>
            I hastened to the swift ship, and the shore of the sea; then I <lb/>
            found my beloved companions at the swift ship, lamenting <lb/>
            miserably, shedding the warm tear. And as when field-dwell­ <lb/>
            ing calves all skip together opposite, around cows of the herd, <pb n="142"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="411—451."/> <lb/>
            when they come to the dung-heap, after they have been satisfied <lb/>
            with pasture ; nor did the stalls any longer contain them, but <lb/>
            continually lowing, they run about their mothers; so they, <lb/>
            when they beheld me with their eyes, weeping were poured <lb/>
            around me: and their mind seemed to be in the same state as <lb/>
            though they had come to their country and their city of rough <lb/>
            Ithaca, where they were nurtured and were born. And la­ <lb/>
            menting, they addressed to me winged words: 'We so re­ <lb/>
            joice at thy return, O noble one, as if we had come to our <lb/>
            paternal land, Ithaca: but come, relate the death of OUT other <lb/>
            companions."</p>
          <p>“ Thus they spoke; but I addressed them with words: <lb/>
            ‘ First of all let us draw the ship to the shore, and let us lay <lb/>
            up our possessions and all our arms in the caves: and do ye <lb/>
            all together hasten to follow me, that ye may see your com­ <lb/>
            panions, drinking and eating in the sacred house of Circe: <lb/>
            for they have abundance.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus I spoke; but they quickly obeyed my words: but <lb/>
            Eurylochus alone detained all my companions, [and address­ <lb/>
            ing them, spoke winged words] :</p>
          <p>“‘Ah wretched ones, where shall we go ? why do ye long <lb/>
            for these evils, to go down to the palace of Circe ? who will <lb/>
            make us all either swine, or wolves, or lions; who must <lb/>
            guard her great house, even by necessity. So also the <lb/>
            Cyclops did, when OUT companions came to his abode, and <lb/>
            bold Ulysses followed with them: for they also perished <lb/>
            through his infatuation.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus he spoke; but I meditated in my mind, drawing <lb/>
            my long sword from my stout thigh, having cut off his head, <lb/>
            to throw it to the ground, although he was very near to me <lb/>
            in kindred ;15 but my companions one with another restrained <lb/>
            me with gentle words: ‘ O noble one, let us leave him, if <lb/>
            thou desirest it, to remain here near the ship and to guard <lb/>
            the ship. But do thou lead us to the sacred dwelling of <lb/>
            Circe.'</p>
          <p>" Thus having spoken, they went up from the ship and the <lb/>
            sea. Nor was Eurylochus left at the hollow ship, but he fol­ <lb/>
            lowed ; for he feared my terrible threat. But in the mean <lb/>
            time Circe had carefully washed and anointed with rich oil <lb/>
            my other companions in hei house; and she threw woollen <note type="footnote"> 18 Eurylochus had married Ktimene, sister of Ulysses. </note> <pb n="143"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="4—491."/> <lb/>
            cloaks around them and garments; and we found them all <lb/>
            banqueting in the palace. But when they beheld one another, <lb/>
            and thought of all things, they wept mourning, and the house <lb/>
            resounded with groans on all sides. And she, the divine one <lb/>
            of goddesses, standing near me addressed [me] :</p>
          <p>“‘ O noble son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses, no <lb/>
            more now excite fresh mourning; even I myself know both <lb/>
            what griefs thou hast suffered in the fishy sea, and what <lb/>
            harms hostile men have done to thee on the shore. But come, <lb/>
            eat food and drink wine, until thou again receivest thy mind <lb/>
            in thy breast, such as when first thou didst leave thy paternal <lb/>
            land of rugged Ithaca: but now thou art wearied16 and spirit­ <lb/>
            less, ever mindful of thy severe wanderings : nor is thy mind <lb/>
            ever in joyfulness since thou hast suffered very many things.'</p>
          <p>" Thus she spoke; but our noble mind was immediately <lb/>
            persuaded. There we sat all the days for a full year, feasting <lb/>
            upon abundance of flesh and sweet wine: but when it was <lb/>
            now a year, and the seasons turned round, [the months waning, <lb/>
            and the long days were brought round to a conclusion,] then <lb/>
            my beloved companions calling me out, spoke:</p>
          <p>" ' Wretched one, now at length be mindful of thy paternal <lb/>
            land, if it is foretold for thee to be saved, and reach thy lofty- <lb/>
            roofed house, and thine own paternal land.'</p>
          <p>[" Thus they spoke; but my noble mind was persuaded. <lb/>
            Thus then we sat during the whole day until sun-set, feasting <lb/>
            upon abundance of flesh and sweet wine: but when the sun <lb/>
            set and darkness came on, they slept in the shadowy palace.] <lb/>
            But I, having ascended the beautiful bed of Circe, besought <lb/>
            her at her knees ; and the goddess heard my voice, and ad­ <lb/>
            dressing her, I spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" ' O Circe, perform for me the promise, which thou didst <lb/>
            promise, that thou wouldst send me home; for my mind <lb/>
            now urges me, and that of my other beloved companions, who <lb/>
            waste away my dear heart, mourning around me, when thou <lb/>
            indeed dost happen to be at a distance.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; but she, the divine one of goddesses, im­ <lb/>
            mediately answered me : ‘ O noble son of Laertes, much-con­ <lb/>
            triving Ulysses, do not ye any longer remain in my house <lb/>
            against your will. But ye must first perform another voy­ <lb/>
            age, and come to the house of Pluto and awful Proserpine, <note type="footnote"> 16 Literally, parched, dry. </note> <pb n="144"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n=" 492—520"/> <lb/>
            to consult the soul of Theban Tiresias, a blind prophet, whose <lb/>
            mind is firm; to him even when dead Proserpine has given <lb/>
            understanding, alone to be prudent; but the rest flit17 about <lb/>
            as shades.'</p>
          <p>" Thus she spoke ; but my dear heart was broken ; and I <lb/>
            sat down on the bed and wept, nor did my mind wish to live <lb/>
            any longer and behold the light of the sun. But when I was <lb/>
            satiated with weeping and rolling about, then answering her <lb/>
            with words I addressed her:</p>
          <p>" ‘ O Circe, who will conduct me on this voyage ? no one <lb/>
            has yet come to Pluto's in a black ship.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; but she, the divine one of goddesses, im­ <lb/>
            mediately answered me : ‘ O noble son of Laertes, much-con­ <lb/>
            triving Ulysses, let not the desire of a guide for thy ship be <lb/>
            at all a care to thee: but having erected the mast, and spread <lb/>
            out the white sails, sit down: and let the blast of the north <lb/>
            wind carry it. But when thou shalt have passed through the <lb/>
            ocean in thy ship, where is the easy-dug18 shore, and the groves <lb/>
            of Proserpine, and tall poplars, and fruit-destroying willows, <lb/>
            there draw up thy ship in the deep-eddying ocean, and do thou <lb/>
            thyself go to the spacious house of Pluto. Here indeed both <lb/>
            Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus,19 which is a stream from the <lb/>
            water of Styx, flow into Acheron, and there is a rock, and <lb/>
            the meeting of two loud-sounding rivers. There then, O <lb/>
            hero, approaching near as I command thee, dig a trench, the <lb/>
            width of a cubit each way: and pour around it libations to <lb/>
            all the dead, first with mixed honey, then with sweet wine, <lb/>
            again the third time with water:20 and sprinkle white meal <note type="footnote"> 17 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀἲσσω</foreign> is properly used of the wandering, uncertain motion of ghosts. <lb/>

            over it. And entreat much the powerless heads of the dead, <lb/>
            [promising, that] when thou eoniest to Ithaca, thou wilt <lb/>
            offer up in thy palace a barren heifer, whichever is the best, <lb/>
            and wilt fill the pyre with excellent things; and that thou <lb/>
            wilt sacrifice separately to Tiresias alone a sheep all-black, <lb/>
            which excels amongst thy sheep. But when thou shalt have <lb/>
            entreated the illustrious nations of the dead with prayers, then <lb/>
            sacrifice a male sheep and a black female, turning towards <lb/>
            Erebus, and do thou thyself be turned away at a distance, <lb/>
            going towards the streams of the river ; but there many souls <lb/>
            of those gone dead will come. Then immediately exhort thy <lb/>
            companions, and command them, having skinned the sheep <lb/>
            which lie there slain with the unpitying brass, to burn them, and <lb/>
            to invoke the gods, both mighty Pluto and dread Proserpine. <lb/>
            And do thou, having drawn thy sharp sword from thy thigh, <lb/>
            sit down, nor suffer the powerless heads of the dead to go <lb/>
            near the blood, before thou inquirest of Tiresias. There the <lb/>
            prophet will immediately come to thee, O leader of the people, <lb/>
            who will tell to thee the voyage and the measures of the way, <lb/>
            and thy return, how thou mayest go over the fishy sea.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus she spoke ; and the golden-throned molli immediately <lb/>
            came. And she put a cloak around me, and a tunic, as gar­ <lb/>
            ments. But the Nymph herself put on a large white veil, <lb/>
            slender and graceful, and around her loins she threw a girdle <lb/>
            beautiful, of gold; and she put a head-dress on her head. <lb/>
            But I, going through the house, incited my companions with <lb/>
            mild words, standing near each man : 'No longer now slum­ <lb/>
            bering crop the flower of sweet sleep : but let us go ; for novs <lb/>
            venerable Circe has counselled me.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke ; and their noble mind was persuaded : n&lt; <lb/>
            even from thence did I lead away my companions unharmed <lb/>
            for there was a certain Elpenor, the youngest, not very <unclear>cou</unclear> <lb/>
            ageous in war, nor proper in his understanding, who, heav <lb/>
            with wine, lay down, desiring coolness at a distance from L <lb/>
            companions in the house of Circe : but having heard the <unclear>no</unclear> <lb/>
            and bustle of his companions moving, he rushed up on a su <lb/>
            den, and forgot in his mind to descend backwards, when ] <lb/>
            came to a long ladder; but he fell straight down from <unclear>t</unclear> <lb/>
            roof; and his neck was broken from the vertebræ, and his <lb/>
            soul went down to Hades. And I spoke words to them whe <lb/>
            they came: <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>

            houses of Pluto and severe Proserpine, to consult the soul of <lb/>
            Theban Tiresias.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke ; but their dear heart was broken : and sit­ <lb/>

            was not any advantage to them wailing.</p>
          <p>" But when now we went sorrowing to the swift ship and <lb/>
            the shore of the sea, shedding the warm tear; in the mean <lb/>
            time Circe, going to the black ship, bound to it a male sheep, <lb/>
            and a black female, easily escaping our notice ; for who could <lb/>

            turns back again from heaven to earth; but pernicious night <lb/>
            is spread over hapless mortals. Having come there, we <lb/>
            drew up our ship ; and we took out the sheep ; and we our­ <lb/>
            selves went again to the stream of the ocean, until we came <lb/>
            to the place which Circe mentioned. There Perimedes <lb/>
            and Eurylochus made sacred offerings; but I, drawing my <lb/>
            sharp sword from my thigh, dug a trench, the width of a <lb/>
            cubit each way; and around it we poured libations to all the <lb/>
            dead, first with mixed honey, then with sweet wine, again a <lb/>
            third time with water; and I sprinkled white meal over it. <lb/>
            And I much besought the unsubstantial heads of the dead, <lb/>
            [promising, that] when I came to Ithaca, I would offer up in <lb/>
            my palace a barren heifer, whichever is the best, and would <lb/>
            fill a pyre with excellent things; and that I would sacrifice <lb/>
            separately to Tiresias alone a sheep all black, which excels <lb/>
            amongst our sheep.</p>
          <p>" But when I had besought them, the nations of the dead, <lb/>
            with vows and prayers, then taking the sheep, I cut off their <lb/>
            heads into the trench, and the black blood flowed: and the <lb/>
            souls of the perished dead were assembled forth from Erebus, <lb/>
            [betrothed girls and youths, and much-enduring old men, and <lb/>
            tender virgins, having a newly-grieved mind, and many Mars­ <lb/>
            renowned men wounded with brass-tipped spears, possessing <lb/>
            gore-smeared arms, who, in great numbers, were wandering <lb/>
            about the trench on different sides with a divine clamour : and <lb/>
            pale fear seized upon me.] Then at length exhorting my <lb/>
            companions, I commanded them, having skinned the sheep <lb/>
            which lay there, slain with the cruel brass, to burn them, and <lb/>
            to invoke the gods, both Pluto and dread Proserpine. But <lb/>
            I, having drawn my sharp sword from my thigh, sat down, nor <lb/>
            did I suffer the powerless heads of the dead to draw nigh <lb/>
            the blood, before I inquired of Tiresias. And first the soul <lb/>
            of my companion Elpenor came ; for he was not yet buried be­ <lb/>
            neath the wide-wayed earth ; for we left his body in the palace <lb/>
            of Circe unwept for and unburied,3 since another toil [then] <lb/>
            urged us. Beholding him, I wept, and pitied him in my mind, <lb/>
            and addressing him, spoke winged words : ‘ O Elpenor, how <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> It is a well-known superstition, that the ghosts of the dead were sup­ <lb/>
            posed to wander as long as they remained unburied, and were not suffered <lb/>

            being on foot, than I with a black ship.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke ; but he groaning answered me in discourse, <lb/>
            ['0 Jove-born son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses,] the <lb/>
            evil destiny of the deity and the abundant wine hurt me. <lb/>
            Lying down in the palace of Circe, I did not think to go down <lb/>
            backwards, having come to the long ladder, but I fell down­ <lb/>
            wards from the roof; and my neck was broken from the verte­ <lb/>
            brae, and my soul descended to Hades. Now, I entreat thee by <lb/>
            those who are [left] behind, and not present, by thy wife and <lb/>
            father, who nurtured thee when little, and Telemachus, whom <lb/>
            thou didst leave alone in thy palace; for I know, that going <lb/>
            hence from the house of Pluto, thou wilt moor thy well- <lb/>
            wrought ship at the island of Ææa: there then, O king, I <lb/>
            exhort thee to be mindful of me, nor, when thou departest, <lb/>
            leave me behind, unwept for, unburied, going at a distance, <lb/>
            lest I should become some cause to thee of the wrath of the <lb/>
            gods: but burn me with whatever arms are mine, and build <lb/>
            on the shore of the hoary sea a monument for me, a wretched <lb/>
            man, to be heard of even by posterity; perform these things <lb/>
            for me, and fix upon the tomb the oar with which I rowed <lb/>
            whilst alive, being with my companions.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus he spoke; but I answering addressed him: ‘0 <lb/>
            wretched one, I will perform and do these things for thee.'</p>
          <p>" Thus we sat answering one another with bitter words ; I <lb/>
            indeed holding my sword off over the blood, but the image of <lb/>
            my companion on the other side spoke many things. And <lb/>
            afterwards there came on the soul of my deceased mother, <lb/>
            Anticlea, daughter of magnanimous Autolycus, whom I left <lb/>
            alive, on going to sacred Ilium. I indeed wept beholding her, <lb/>
            and pitied her in my mind ; but not even thus, although griev­ <lb/>
            in,; very much, did I suffer her to go forward near to the <lb/>
            blood, before I inquired of Tiresias. But at length the soul <lb/>
            of Theban Tiresias came on, holding a golden sceptre, but me <lb/>
            he knew and addressed:</p>
          <p>“‘[O Jove-born son of Laertes,] why, O wretched one, <lb/>

            blood and tell thee what is unerring.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus he spoke ; but I retiring back, fixed my silver-hilted <lb/>
            sword in the sheath ; but when he had drunk the black blood, <lb/>
            then at length the blameless prophet addressed me with words :</p>
          <p>“‘ Thou seekest a pleasant return, O illustrious Ulysses; <lb/>
            but the deity will render it difficult for thee ; for I do not think <lb/>
            that thou wilt escape the notice of Neptune, who has set wrath <lb/>
            in his mind against thee, enraged because thou hast blinded his <lb/>
            dear son. But still, even so, although suffering ills, thou mayest <lb/>
            come, if thou art willing to restrain thy longing, and that of <lb/>
            thy companions, when thou shalt first drive thy well-wrought <lb/>
            ship to the Trinacrian island, escaping from the azure main, <lb/>
            and find the beeves pasturing, and the fat cattle of the sun, who <lb/>
            beholds all things, and hears all things; if indeed thou shalt <lb/>
            leave these unharmed, and art careful of thy return, even <lb/>
            then thou mayest come to Ithaca, although suffering ills: but <lb/>
            if thou harmest them, then I foretell to thee destruction for <lb/>
            thy ship and thy companions; but even if thou shouldst thy­ <lb/>
            self escape, thou wilt return late, in calamity, having lost all <lb/>
            thy companions, in a foreign ship ; and thou wilt find troubles <lb/>
            in thine house, overbearing men, who consume thy livelihood, <lb/>
            wooing thy goddess-like wife, and offering thyself for her dowry <lb/>
            gifts. But certainly when thou comest thou wilt revenge their <lb/>
            violence; but when thou slayest the suitors in thy palace, <lb/>
            either by deceit, or openly with sharp brass, then go, taking a <lb/>
            well-fitted oar, until thou comest to those men, who are not ac­ <lb/>

            are acquainted with crimson-cheeked5 ships, nor well-fitted <lb/>

            answered me: ‘ She by all means remains with an enduring <lb/>

            continually spent in tears. But no one as yet possesses thy <lb/>
            noble property: but Telemachus manages thy estates in <lb/>
            quiet, and feasts upon equal feasts, which it is fit for a man <lb/>
            who is a prince to prepare; for all invite him: but thy father <lb/>
            remains there in the country, nor does he come to the city; <lb/>
            nor has he beds, and couches, and clothes, and variegated rugs. <lb/>
            But he sleeps indeed, during the winter, where the servants <lb/>
            [sleep], in the house, in the dust, near the fire, and he puts <lb/>
            sad garments about his body: but when summer arrives, and <lb/>
            flourishing autumn, his bed is strewn on the ground, of the <lb/>
            leaves that fall on every side of his wine-producing vineyard. <lb/>
            Here he lies sorrowing, and he cherishes great grief in his <lb/>
            mind, lamenting thy fate; and severe old age comes upon <lb/>
            him: for so I also perished, and drew on my fate. Nor did <lb/>
            the well-aiming, shaft-delighting [goddess], coming upon me <lb/>
            with her mild weapons, slay me in the palace. Nor did any <lb/>
            disease come upon me, which especially takes away the mind <lb/>
            from the limbs with hateful consumption. But regret for <lb/>
            thee, and cares for thee, O illustrious Ulysses, and kindness <lb/>
            for thee, deprived me of my sweet life.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus she spoke; but I, meditating in my mind, wished <lb/>
            to lay hold of the soul of my departed mother. Thrice indeed <lb/>
            I essayed it, and my mind urged me to lay hold of it, but <lb/>
            thrice it flew from my hands, like unto a shadow, or even to <lb/>
            a dream: but sharp grief arose in my heart still more; and <lb/>
            addressing her, I spoke winged words :</p>
          <p>“ ‘ Mother mine, why dost thou not remain for me, desirous <lb/>
            to take hold of thee, that even in Hades, throwing around our <lb/>
            dear hands, we may both be satiated with sad grief? Has <lb/>
            illustrious Proserpine sent forth this an image for me, that I <lb/>
            may lament still more, mourning ?'</p>
          <p>“ Thus I spoke; my venerable mother immediately an­ <lb/>
            swered me: ‘ Alas ! my son, unhappy above all mortals, Pro­ <lb/>
            sarpine, the daughter of Jove, by no means deceives thee, but <lb/>
            this is the condition of mortals, when they are dead. For <pb n="152"/>

            force of burning fire subdues them, when first the mind leaves <lb/>
            the white bones, but the soul, like as a dream, flittering, flies <lb/>
            away. But hasten as quick as possible to the light; and <lb/>
            know all these things, that even hereafter thou mayest tell <lb/>
            them to thy wife.'</p>
          <p>" Thus we twain answered each other with words; but the <lb/>
            women came-for illustrious Proserpine excited them—as <lb/>
            many as were the wives and daughters of chiefs. And they <lb/>
            were assembled together around the black blood. And I took <lb/>
            counsel how I might inquire of cach ; and this plan in my mind <lb/>
            appeared to me to be the best, having drawn my long sword <lb/>
            from my stout thigh, I did not suffer them all to drink the <lb/>
            black blood at the same time. But they came one after an­ <lb/>
            other,7 and each related her race; but I inquired of all. There <lb/>
            then I saw Tyro first, born of a noble father, who said that <lb/>
            she was the offspring of blameless Salmoneus. And she said <lb/>
            that she was the wife of Cretheus, son of Æolus. She loved <lb/>
            the divine river Enipeus, which flows far the fairest of rivers <lb/>
            upon the earth; and she was constantly walking near the <lb/>
            beautiful streams of the Enipeus. Earth-shaking Neptune, <lb/>
            therefore, likened unto him, lay with her at the mouth8 of <lb/>
            the eddying river : and the purple wave surrounded them, <lb/>
            like unto a mountain, arched, and concealed the god, and the <lb/>
            mortal woman ; land he loosed her virgin zone, and shed sleep <lb/>
            over her.] But when the god had accomplished the deeds of <lb/>
            love, he laid hold of her hand, and spoke and addressed her:</p>
          <p>" ‘ Rejoice, O woman, on account of our love; for when a <lb/>
            year has rolled round, thou shalt bring forth illustrious chil­ <lb/>
            dren ; since the beds of the immortals are not in vain ; but do <lb/>
            thou take care of them, and bring them up, but now go to <lb/>
            thine house, and restrain thyself, nor mention it; but I am <lb/>
            Earth-shaking Neptune.'</p>
          <p>" Thus having spoke, he dived beneath the billowy sea; <lb/>
            but she having conceived, brought forth Pelias and Neleus, <lb/>
            who both became noble servants of Jove. Pelias, indeed, <figure type="illustration">

            men. Then he, suffering grief in delightful Thebes, ruled <lb/>
            over the Cadmeians, through the pernicious counsels of the <lb/>
            gods ; but she went to the [dwellings] of strong-gated Hades, <lb/>
            suspending the cord on high11 from the lofty house, held fast <lb/>
            by her own sorrow ; but she left behind for him very many <lb/>
            griefs, as many as the Furies of a mother accomplish.</p>
          <p>“ And I saw the very beautiful Chloris, whom Neleus once <lb/>
            married, on account of her beauty, when he had given her <lb/>
            countless dowries, the youngest daughter of Amphion, son of <lb/>
            Iasus : who once ruled strongly in Minyean Orchomenus; <lb/>
            aad he reigned over Pylos; and she bore to him noble chil­ <lb/>
            dren, Nestor, and Chromius, and proud Periclymenus; and <lb/>
            besides these she brought forth strong Pero, a marvel to mor­ <lb/>
            tals, whom all the neighbouring inhabitants wooed; nor did <lb/>
            Nelsus at all offer [her] to any one, who could not drive <lb/>

            Iphicles, with wide foreheads, [and] troublesome ;12 a blame­ <lb/>
            less seer alone promised that he would drive these away; but <lb/>
            the severe Fate of the gods hindered him, and difficult fet­ <lb/>
            ters, and rustic herdsmen. But when the months and days <lb/>
            were now completed, a year having again gone round, and the <lb/>
            hours came on, then at length the mighty Iphicles loosed him, <lb/>
            having told all the oracles; and the counsel of Jove was <lb/>
            fulfilled.</p>
          <p>" And I beheld Leda, the wife of Tyndareus, who brought <lb/>
            forth two noble-minded sons from Tyndareus, steed-subduing <lb/>
            Castor, and Pollux who excelled in pugilism; both of these <lb/>
            the fruitful earth detains alive ; who, even beneath the earth, <lb/>
            having honour from Jove, sometimes live on alternate days, <lb/>
            and sometimes again are dead, and they have obtained by lot <lb/>
            honour equally with the gods.</p>
          <p>“ After her I beheld Iphimedia, wife of Aloëus, who said <lb/>
            that she had been united to Neptune: and bore two sons, but <lb/>
            they were short-lived, godlike Otus, and far-famed Ephialtes; <lb/>
            whom the fruitful earth nourished, the tallest, and far the <lb/>
            most beautiful, at least after illustrious Orion. For at nine <lb/>
            years old they were also nine cubits in width, but in height <lb/>
            they were nine fathoms. Who even threatened the immortals <lb/>
            that they would set up a strife of impetuous13 war in Olympus : <lb/>
            they attempted to place Ossa upon Olympus, and upon Ossa <lb/>
            leafy Pelion, that heaven might be accessible. And they <lb/>
            would have accomplished it, if they had reached the measure <lb/>
            of youth : but the son of Jove, whom fair-haired Latona bore, <lb/>
            destroyed them both; before the down flowered under their <lb/>
            temples, and thickened upon their cheek with a flowering <lb/>
            beard.</p>
          <p>" And I beheld Phædra and Procris, and fair Ariadne, the <lb/>
            daughter of wise Minos, whom Theseus once led from Crete <lb/>
            to the soil of sacred Athens, but he did not enjoy her; for <lb/>
            Diana first slew her in the island Dia, on account of the testi­ <lb/>
            mony of Bacchus.</p>

              the swift ship to my companions, or here; but my conduct <lb/>
              will be a care to the gods and to you."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but they all had been hushed in silence, <lb/>
            and fast held by the soothing [of his words] through the <lb/>
            shadowy palace. But white-armed Arete began speaking to <lb/>
            them:</p>
          <p>" O Phæacians, how does this man appear to you to be, in <lb/>
            form, and size, and in equal mind within ? He indeed is my <lb/>
            guest: but each of you shares the honour: do not therefore <lb/>
            dismiss him in haste, nor be sparing in presents to one thus <lb/>
            in want, for many possessions lie in your houses through the <lb/>
            kindness of the gods."</p>
          <p>The aged hero Echenëus, [who was the oldest of the Phæ­ <lb/>
            acians,] also addressed them: “ O my friends, the prudent <lb/>
            queen does not speak to you away from the mark, nor from <lb/>
            propriety; but do ye obey [her]; but both the deed and <lb/>
            word of this depends upon Alcinous."</p>
          <p>But him Alcinous answered in turn, and said: " This word <lb/>
            shall indeed be so, if I reign alive over the oar-loving Phæa­ <lb/>
            cians. But let the stranger endure, although very much <lb/>
            craving a return, to remain at all events till to-morrow, until <lb/>
            I shall complete the whole gift; for his conduct shall be all <lb/>
            men's care, but mine especially; for mine14 is the power <lb/>
            amongst the people."</p>
          <p>But him much-counselling Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            " O King Alcinous, most glorious of all the people, if thou <lb/>
            shouldst command me to remain here even for a year, and <lb/>
            shouldst prepare my conduct, and give me noble gifts, I <lb/>
            should wish it indeed, and it would be much better, that I <lb/>
            should come to my dear country with a fuller hand; and I <lb/>
            should be more honoured, and beloved by all men, as many as <lb/>
            should behold me returning to Ithaca."</p>
          <p>But him Alcinous answered in turn, and said : " O Ulysses, <lb/>
            looking upon thee, we do not suspect that at all, that you are an <lb/>
            impostor and thief, many such as far-scattered men the black <lb/>

            understanding; and thou hast related thy story skilfully, as a <lb/>
            bard, the sad cares of all the Greeks and of thyself. But come, <lb/>
            tell me this, and relate it truly, if thou hast seen any of thy <lb/>
            godlike companions, who followed together with thyself to <lb/>
            Ilium, and drew on their fate there. This night is very long, <lb/>
            immense ;15 nor is there any time to sleep in the palace; but <lb/>
            do thou relate to me wondrous deeds: and I could bear it <lb/>
            even until divine morning, when thou wouldst endure to <lb/>
            recount to me in my palace thine own sorrows."</p>
          <p>And him much-planning Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            " O King Alcinous, most illustrious of all the people, there is <lb/>
            a season for many words, and a season also for sleep. But if <lb/>
            thou still desirest to listen, I would not grudge to relate to <lb/>
            thee other even more grievous sorrows of my companions, <lb/>
            who perished afterwards; who escaped indeed from the sad <lb/>
            war of the Trojans, but perished on their return, by the de­ <lb/>
            sign of an evil woman. When chaste Proserpine had dis­ <lb/>
            persed the souls of women in different places, the soul of <lb/>
            Agamemnon, son of Atreus, came up, sorrowing: and the <lb/>
            rest were assembled around him, as many as died, and drew <lb/>
            on their fate in the house of Ægisthus together with him ; and <lb/>
            he immediately knew me, when he had drunk the black blood ; <lb/>
            and he wept shrilly, shedding the warm tear, holding out his <lb/>
            hands to me, desiring to lay hold of me. But he had no <lb/>
            longer firm strength, nor power at all, such as was before in his <lb/>
            bending limbs. I wept indeed, beholding him, and pitied him <lb/>
            in my mind, and addressing him I spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" ‘ O most glorious son of Atreus, Agamemnon, king of <lb/>
            men, what fate of long-sleeping death subdued thee ? Did <lb/>
            Neptune subdue thee in thy ships, raising an immense16 blast <lb/>
            of cruel winds ? Or did unjust men injure thee on land, while <lb/>
            thou wert cutting off their oxen, and beautiful flocks of sheep, <lb/>
            or contending for a city, or for women ?’</p>

            did Neptune subdue me in my ships, raising an immense blast <lb/>
            of cruel winds, nor did unjust men injure me on land; but <lb/>
            Ægisthus, having contrived death and Fate for me, slew me, <lb/>
            [conspiring] with my pernicious wife, having invited me to <lb/>
            his house, entertaining me at a feast, as any one has slain an <lb/>
            ox at the stall. Thus I died by a most piteous death ; and <lb/>
            my other companions were cruelly slain around me, as swine <lb/>
            with white tusks, which [are slain] either at the marriage, <lb/>
            or collation,17 or splendid banquet of a wealthy, very power­ <lb/>
            ful man. Thou hast already been present at the slaughter of <lb/>
            many men, slain separately, and in hard battle; but if thou <lb/>
            hadst seen those things, thou wouldst have especially lamented <lb/>
            in thy mind, how we lay in the palace about the cups and full <lb/>
            tables; and the whole ground reeked with blood. And I <lb/>
            heard the most piteous voice of the daughter of Priam, Cas­ <lb/>
            sandra, whom deceitful Clytemnestra slew near me; but I, <lb/>
            raising my hands from the earth, dying, laid them on my <lb/>
            sword ; but she, impudent one, went away, nor did she endure <lb/>
            to close my eyes with her hands, and shut my mouth, although <lb/>
            I was going to Hades. So there is nothing else more terrible <lb/>
            and impudent than a woman, who indeed casts about such deeds <lb/>
            in her mind : what an unseemly deed has she indeed contrived, <lb/>
            having prepared murder for her husband, whom she lawfully <lb/>
            married !18 I thought indeed that I should return home wel­ <lb/>
            come to my children and my servants; but she, above all <lb/>
            acquainted with wicked things, has shed disgrace over herself, <lb/>

            But for thee indeed there will not be murder at the hands <lb/>

            of Icarus, is very wise, and is well acquainted with counsels <lb/>

            now probably sits amongst the number of men, happy one ; for <lb/>
            his dear father will surely behold him, when returning, and he <lb/>
            will embrace his sire, as is right; but she my wife did not suf­ <lb/>

            slew even me myself. But I will tell thee something else, <lb/>

            where near Menelaus in wide Sparta ? for divine Orestes has <lb/>

          <p>“We twain stood thus mourning, answering one another <lb/>
            with sad words, shedding the warm tear. And the soul of <lb/>

            less Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the most excellent as to <lb/>
            his form and person of all the Danaans after the blameless son <lb/>
            of Peleus. And the soul of the swift-footed descendant of <lb/>
            Æacus knew me, and lamenting addressed me [in] winged <lb/>
            words:</p>
          <p>“‘ O Jove-born son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses, <lb/>
            wretched one, why dost thou meditate a still greater work in <lb/>
            thy mind ? how didst thou dare to descend to Orcus, where <lb/>
            dwell the witless dead, the images of deceased mortals ?’</p>
          <p>“ Thus he spoke; but I addressed him in answer: ‘ Achilles, <lb/>

            alive equally with the gods, and now again, when thou art here, <lb/>
            thou hast great power amongst the deceased; do not therefore <lb/>
            when dead be sad, O Achilles.'</p>
          <p>“ Thus I spoke; but he immediately addressed me in <lb/>

            rule over all the departed dead. But come, tell me an account <lb/>
            of my noble son; did he follow to the war so as to be a chief <lb/>
            or not ? and, tell me if thou hast heard any thing of blameless <lb/>

            as when I slew the best of the people in wide Troy, fighting <lb/>
            for the Grecians. If I should come as such a one even for a <lb/>
            short time to the house of my father, so I would make my <lb/>
            strength and unconquerable hands terrible to any, who treat <lb/>
            him with violence, and keep him from honour.'</p>

            tell thee the whole truth, as thou biddest me, about thy dear <lb/>
            son Neoptolemus; for I myself led him in an equal hollow <lb/>
            ship from Scyros to the well-greaved Grecians. Of a truth <lb/>
            when we were taking counsels concerning the city Troy, he al­ <lb/>
            ways spoke first, and did not err in his words: and godlike <lb/>
            Nestor and myself alone contended with him. But when we <lb/>
            were fighting about the city of the Trojans, he never remained <lb/>
            in the number of men, nor in the crowd, but ran on much <lb/>
            before, yielding to no one in his might; and many men he <lb/>
            slew in the terrible contest: but I could not tell nor name all, <lb/>
            how great a people he slew, defending the Greeks. But [I <lb/>

            beheld as the most beautiful, after divine Memnon. But when <lb/>
            we, the chieftains of the Grecians, ascended into the horse, <lb/>
            which Epeus made, and all things were committed to me, <lb/>
            [both to open the thick ambush and to shut it,] there the <lb/>
            other leaders and rulers of the Greeks both wiped away their <lb/>
            tears, and the limbs of each trembled under them ; but him I <lb/>
            never saw at all with my eyes, either turning pale as to his <lb/>
            beauteous complexion, or wiping away the tears from his <lb/>
            cheeks; but he implored me very much to go out of the horse ; <lb/>
            and grasped the hilt of his sword, and his brass-heavy spear, <lb/>
            and he meditated evils against the Trojans. But when we <lb/>
            had sacked the lofty city of Priam, having his share and ex­ <lb/>
            cellent reward, he embarked unhurt on a ship, neither stricken <lb/>
            with the sharp brass, nor wounded [in fighting] hand to hand, <lb/>
            as oftentimes happens in war; for Mars confusedly raves.'</p>

            very illustrious. But the other souls of the deceased dead <lb/>
            stood sorrowing, and each related their griefs. But the soul <lb/>
            of Ajax, son of Telamon, stood afar off, angry on account of <lb/>
            the victory, in which I conquered him, contending in trial <lb/>
            at the ships concerning the arms of Achilles; for his vener­ <lb/>

            of the destructive arms ? for the gods made them a harm unto <lb/>
            the Grecians. For thou, who wast such a fortress to them, <lb/>
            didst perish; for thee, when dead, we Greeks altogether <lb/>
            mourned, equally as for the person of Achilles, the son of <lb/>
            Peleus; nor was any one else the cause; but Jupiter vehe­ <lb/>

            fate upon you. But come hither, O king, that thou mayest <lb/>
            hear our word and speech ; and subdue thy strength and <lb/>
            haughty mind.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke ; but he answered me not at all, but went to <lb/>
            Erebus amongst the other souls of the deceased dead. There <lb/>
            however, [although] angry, he would have spoken to me, or J <lb/>

            he, like unto dark night, having a naked bow, and an arrow <lb/>
            at the string, looking about terribly, was always like unto one <lb/>
            about to let fly a shaft. And there was a fearful belt around <lb/>
            his breast, the thong was golden: on which wondrous forms <lb/>
            were wrought, bears, and wild boars, and terrible lions, and <lb/>
            contests, and battles, and slaughters, and slayings of men ; he <lb/>
            who devised that thong with his art, never having wrought <lb/>
            such a one before, could he work any other such. But he <lb/>
            immediately knew me, when he saw me with his eyes, and <lb/>
            pitying me, addressed winged words :</p>
          <p>" 1 O Jove-born son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses, <lb/>
            ah wretched one, thou too art certainly pursuing some evil <lb/>

            was indeed the son of Jove, the son of Saturn, but I had in­ <lb/>
            finite labour; for I was subjected to a much inferior man, <lb/>
            who enjoined upon me difficult contests: and once he sent me . <lb/>

            and led it from Pluto's, but Mercury and blue-eyed Minerva <lb/>
            escorted me.'</p>
          <p>" Thus having spoken, lie went again within the house of <lb/>
            Pluto. But I remained there firmly, if by chance any one of <lb/>
            the heroes, who perished in former times, would still come ; <lb/>
            and I should now still have seen former men, whom I wished, <lb/>
            [Theseus, and Pirithoüs, glorious children of the gods;] but <lb/>
            first myriads of nations of the dead were assembled around me <lb/>
            with a divine clamour; and pale fear seized me, lest to me <lb/>
            illustrious Proserpine should send a Gorgon head of a terrific <lb/>
            monster29 from Orcus. Going then immediately to my ship, <lb/>
            I ordered my companions to go on board themselves, and to <lb/>
            loose the halsers. But they quickly embarked, and sat down <lb/>
            on the benches. And the wave of the stream carried it <lb/>
            through the ocean river, first the rowing and afterwards a <lb/>

            dead Elpenor. And immediately cutting trunks, where the <lb/>
            shore projected the farthest, we buried [him] in sorrow, shed­ <lb/>
            ding the warm tear. But when the corpse was burnt, and <lb/>
            the arms of the dead, having built a tomb, and having erected <lb/>
            a column over it, we fixed the well-fitted oar at the top of the <lb/>
            tomb.</p>
          <p>"We indeed went through every thing; nor yet returning <lb/>
            from Hades did we escape Circe, but she came very quickly, <lb/>
            hastening : and her female attendants with her brought bread, <lb/>
            and much flesh, and dark-red wine. And she, the divine one of <lb/>
            goddesses, standing in the middle of us, addressed us :</p>
          <p>" ' Wretched ones ! who alive have eome under the house <lb/>
            of Pluto, twice dead, when other men die but once. But <lb/>
            come, eat food and drink wine here through the whole day; <lb/>
            and ye shall sail together with morn appearing; but I will <lb/>
            show you the way; and will instruct you in every thing; <lb/>
            that ye may not grieve at all, suffering harm either on the sea <lb/>
            or on land by some grievous bad counsel.'</p>
          <p>" Thus she spoke; but our noble mind was forthwith per­ <lb/>
            suaded. Thus, then, during the whole day until sun-set, <lb/>
            we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine; but when <lb/>
            the sun had sunk, and darkness came on, they indeed slept <lb/>
            near the cables of the ship; but she, taking me by the hand, <lb/>
            at a distance from my dear companions, made me sit down, <lb/>
            and reclined opposite,2 and inquired every thing of me ; and I <lb/>
            related all things rightly to her. And then indeed venerable <lb/>
            Circe addressed me with words:</p>
          <p>" ' All these things indeed have thus been performed ; but do <lb/>
            thou listen, how I will tell thee, and a deity himself will make <lb/>
            thee remember it. First indeed thou wilt come to the Sirens, <lb/>
            who charm all men, whoever comes to them. Whosoever <lb/>
            through ignorance has approached and heard the voice of the <lb/>
            Sirens, by no means do his wife and infant children stand <lb/>
            near him when he returns home, nor do they rejoice. But <lb/>
            the Sirens, sitting in a meadow, soothe him with a shrill song, <lb/>
            and around there is a large heap of bones of men rotting, and <lb/>
            skins waste away round about. But sail beyond ; and anoint <lb/>
            the cars of thy companions, moulding sweet wax, lest any one <lb/>
            of the others should hear; but do thou thyself hear, if thou <note type="footnote"> 2 So Clarke and Cowper, but I think the Scholiast is more correct in <lb/>

            wilt. Let them bind thee hands and feet in the swift ship, <lb/>
            upright in the mast hole; and let cables be bound from it; <lb/>
            that, delighted, thou mayest hear the voice of the Sirens : but <lb/>
            if thou entreatest thy companions, and biddest them loose <lb/>
            thee, let them then bind thee in still more bonds. But when thy <lb/>
            companions shall have sailed beyond these, then I cannot tell <lb/>
            thee accurately which will afterwards be thy way; but do <lb/>
            thou thyself consider in thy mind; but I will tell thee of <lb/>
            both ways. There indeed are lofty rocks; and near them <lb/>
            the vast wave of dark Amphitrite resounds ; the blessed gods <lb/>
            call them the Wanderers; here nor birds pass by, nor timid <lb/>
            doves, which carry ambrosia to father Jove; but the smooth <lb/>
            rock always takes away some one of them, but the father sends <lb/>
            another to make up the number. From this not yet has <lb/>
            any ship of men escaped, whichever has come to it; but the <lb/>
            wave of the sea and the storms of destructive fire take away <lb/>
            planks of ships and bodies of men together. That sea- <lb/>
            traversing ship alone has sailed by it, Argo, a care unto <lb/>
            all, which sailed from Æetes: and now perhaps it3 would <lb/>
            have quickly dashed it there against mighty rocks, but <lb/>
            Juno sent it on, since Jason was dear [to her]. But as to <lb/>
            the two rocks,4 the one reaches the wide heaven with its <lb/>
            sharp top, and a dark-grey cloud surrounds it: this indeed <lb/>
            never withdraws,5 nor does a clear sky ever possess its top, <lb/>
            either in the summer or in the autumn ; nor could a mortal <lb/>
            man ascend it, or descend, not if he had twenty hands and <lb/>
            feet; for the rock is smooth, like unto one polished around. <lb/>
            But in the middle of the rock there is a shadowy cave towards <lb/>
            the west, turned to Erebus ;6 where do thou, O illustrious <lb/>
            Ulysses, direct thy hollow ship. Nor could a young man <lb/>
            darting an arrow from a bow from a hollow ship reach the <lb/>
            deep cave. Here Scylla dwells, shrieking out terribly; her <lb/>
            voice indeed is as of a new-born whelp, but she herself is a <lb/>
            vast monster; nor would any rejoice seeing [her], not even <note type="footnote"> 3 Viz. the wave. </note><note type="footnote"> * Put for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν δὲ δύα σκοπέλων</foreign>. See Thiersch, Gk. Gr. § 276, 6, re­ <lb/>

            terrible abyss, and fishes there, watching about the rock, for <lb/>
            dolphins, and dogs, and if she can any where take a larger <lb/>
            whale, which deep-groaning Amphitrite feeds in countless <lb/>
            numbers. By whom unharmed never at any time do sailors <lb/>

            each near to the other; and thou couldst reach it with an <lb/>
            arrow. In this there is a large wild fig-tree flourishing with <lb/>
            leaves; under this divine Charybdis sucks in black water. <lb/>
            For thrice in a day she sends it out, and thrice she sucks it in <lb/>
            terribly: mayest thou not come thither when she is gulping it ; <lb/>
            for not even Neptune could free thee from ill. But by all <lb/>
            means sailing to the rock of Scylla, drive thy ship quickly <lb/>
            beyond ; since it is much better to regretS six companions in <lb/>
            a ship, than all together.'</p>
          <p>" Thus she spoke ; but I answering addressed her ; ' Come <lb/>
            then, tell me this truly, O goddess; if I can by any means <lb/>
            escape out from destructive Charybdis, should I be revenged <lb/>
            upon her, when she has harmed my companions ?'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; but she, the divine one of goddesses, im­ <lb/>
            mediately answered : ' O wretched one, are warlike deeds and <lb/>
            labour still a care to thee ? nor wilt thou yield to the immortal <lb/>
            gods ? She is not indeed mortal, but is an immortal evil, <lb/>
            terrible, and difficult, and fierce, nor to be fought with. Nor <lb/>
            is there any defence; it is best to flee from her: for if thou <lb/>
            shouldst delay, arming thyself, by the rock, I fear lest again <lb/>
            attacking thee she would reach thee with so many heads, and <lb/>
            would take away so many9 men. But sail on very quickly <lb/>
            and call for help to Cratæis, the mother of Scylla, who brought <lb/>
            her forth a destruction to mortals, who will immediately hinder <lb/>
            her from attacking thee afterwards. <note type="footnote"> 7 <foreign xml:lang="grc">λεπτοί, ἠ παραιωρούμενοι καὶ ἀσθενει̃ς</foreign>. Eust. </note><note type="footnote"> a Neatly expressed by Virg. Æn. i. 221, " Amissos longo socios serm&lt; no <lb/>

          <p>" ' And thou wilt come to the island Trinacria ;10 where are <lb/>
            fed many oxen and fat sheep of the Sun,11 seven herds of <lb/>
            oxen, and as many beautiful flocks of sheep, and fifty in each; <lb/>
            but there is no increase of them, nor do they ever perish ; but <lb/>
            goddesses are their shepherdesses, the fair-haired nymphs, <lb/>
            Phaethusa, and Lampetie, whom divine Neæra bore to the sun <lb/>
            who journeys above. Whom having nourished and brought <lb/>
            them forth, their venerable mother sent them away to the <lb/>
            Trinacrian island, to dwell afar off, to guard their father's <lb/>
            sheep and crumpled-horned oxen. If thou leavest these un­ <lb/>
            harmed, and carest for thy return, thou mayest yet come to <lb/>
            Ithaca, although suffering evils ; but if thou harmest them, <lb/>
            then I foretell to thee destruction to thy ship and thy com­ <lb/>
            panions ; and although thou shouldst thyself escape, thou wilt <lb/>
            return late, in misfortune, having lost all thy companions.'</p>
          <p>" Thus she spoke ; but golden-throned morning immedi­ <lb/>
            ately came. The divine one of goddesses then went away <lb/>
            through the island ; but I, going to my ship, excited my com­ <lb/>
            panions to embark themselves, and to loose the halsers. But <lb/>
            they immediately went on board, and sat down on the benches, <lb/>
            and sitting in order they smote the hoary sea with their oars. <lb/>
            Then the fair-haired Circe, an awful goddess, possessing hu­ <lb/>
            man speech, sent a prosperous gale behind our dark-prowed <lb/>
            ship, that filled the sails, an excellent companion. Imme­ <lb/>
            diately having got ready all our tackle in the ship, we sat <lb/>
            down ; and the wind and the helmsman directed it. Then <lb/>
            sorrowing in my heart, I addressed my companions:</p>
          <p>" 'O my friends, it is not fit that one or two only should <lb/>
            know the oracles, which Circe, divine one of goddesses, has <lb/>
            spoken unto me ; but I will tell you, that being aware we may <lb/>
            either die, or avoiding it may escape death and Fate. First <lb/>
            she commands us to shun the voice of the divine Sirens, and <lb/>
            their flowery mead ; she ordered me alone to hear their voice ; <lb/>
            but do ye bind me in a difficult bond, that I may remain <lb/>
            there firmly, upright in the mast-hole: and let cables be fast­ <lb/>
            ened from it. But if I entreat you, and command you to loose <lb/>
            me, do ye then press me with still more bonds.'</p>
          <p>" I indeed telling every thing, related it to my companions: <lb/>
            but in the mean time the well-made ship came quickly to the <lb/>
            island of the Sirens; tor a harmless prosperous gale urged it <note type="footnote"> at i. e. Sicily, " Triquetris insulæ" in Lucretius. </note><note type="footnote">11 Cf i &amp; sqq </note> <pb n="168"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="168- 208."/> <lb/>
            on. Immediately then the wind ceased, and there was a wind­ <lb/>
            less calm, and a deity hushed the winds to sleep. And my <lb/>
            companions rising up, furled the sails of the ship, and placed <lb/>
            them in the hollow ship; and they sitting on their oars, <lb/>
            whitened the water with their polished blades of fir. But I <lb/>
            having cut in small pieces a large circle of wax with the <lb/>
            sharp brass, pressed it with my strong hands: and the wax <lb/>
            immediately became warm, for the great force compelled it, <lb/>
            and the shining of the sun, the king, the son of Him that <lb/>
            journeys on high : and I anointed it in turn upon the ears of <lb/>
            all my companions. But they bound me both hands and feet <lb/>
            together in the ship, upright in the mast-hole, and they fast­ <lb/>
            ened cables from it; and they themselves sitting down smote <lb/>
            the hoary sea with their oars. But when we were so far dis­ <lb/>
            tant as one makes himself heard shouting out, going on swift­ <lb/>
            ly, the ship passing the sea quickly, driving near, did not <lb/>
            escape them, but they prepared a tuneful song.</p>
          <p>" ' Come hither, O much-praised Ulysses, great glory of the <lb/>
            Grecians, stop thy ship, that thou mayest hear our voice ; for <lb/>
            no one has yet passed by here in a black ship, before he has <lb/>
            heard the sweet voice from our mouths; but he goes away <lb/>
            defighted, and acquainted with more things. For we ken all <lb/>
            things, whatever the Grecians and Trojans suffered by the <lb/>
            will of the gods in spacious Troy; and we know whatever <lb/>
            things are done in the food-abounding earth.'</p>
          <p>" Thus they spoke, uttering a sweet sound; but my heart <lb/>
            wished to hear them, and I ordered my companions to loose <lb/>
            me, nodding with my eye-brows; but they falling forward <lb/>
            rowed; and Perimedes and Eurylochus immediately rising, <lb/>
            bound me with more bonds, and pressed me still more. But <lb/>
            when it passed by them, and we no longer heard the voice of <lb/>
            the Sirens, nor their song, my beloved companions imme­ <lb/>
            diately took away the wax, which I anointed on their ears, <lb/>
            and loosed me from the bonds. But when we had now left <lb/>
            the island, immediately I saw smoke and a vast wave, and <lb/>
            heard a noise. The oars flew from the hands of them terrified ; <lb/>
            and all making a noise [went] down the stream; but the ship <lb/>
            was stopped there, since they no longer urged the extended oars <lb/>
            with their hands. But I went through the ship, and incited <lb/>
            my companions with mild words, standing near each man :</p>
          <p>" ' O my friends, we are not by any means 'gnorant of mis- <pb n="169"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="209-250."/> <lb/>
            fortunes. This evil indeed does not come greater upon us <lb/>
            than when the Cyclops shut us in his hollow cave by power­ <lb/>
            ful force; but we escaped even from thence by my valour, <lb/>
            and counsel and prudence ; and I think that you will some <lb/>
            time remember12 these things. But now come, let us all obey, <lb/>
            as I direct; do ye smite the deep billow of the sea with your <lb/>
            oars, sitting on the benches, if Jove will by chance grant us <lb/>
            to escape from and avoid this death. But to thee I order <lb/>
            thus, O helmsman, and lay it up in thy mind, since thou art <lb/>
            managing the rudder of the hollow ship; keep the ship off <lb/>
            from this smoke and wave; and do thou observe the rock, lest <lb/>
            rushing out thence she escape thy notice, and thou cast us <lb/>
            into evil.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke ; and they quickly obeyed my words. But <lb/>
            I did not speak of Scylla, an unavoidable 13 evil, lest my com­ <lb/>
            panions, terrified, should cease from rowing, and huddle them­ <lb/>
            selves within. And then I forgot the terrible command of <lb/>
            Circe, for she ordered me not to arm myself; but I, having <lb/>
            put on my noble arms, and taking two long spears in my <lb/>
            hands, went to the deck of the ship's prow; for I expected <lb/>
            that rocky Scylla, who brought harm to my companions, would <lb/>
            appear from thence first. Nor could I perceive her any <lb/>
            where; but my eyes toiled, looking every where to the dark <lb/>
            rock. And we sailed through the strait, mourning, for on one <lb/>
            side was Scylla, and on the other divine Charybdis terribly <lb/>
            sucked in the briny water of the sea. When she vomited it <lb/>
            out, it all murmured, bubbling up as a cauldron on a large <lb/>
            fire, and the foam fell on high upon both the lofty rocks. But <lb/>
            when she drank up the briny water of the sea, it all appeared <lb/>
            bubbling up within ; and thundered terribly about the rock, <lb/>
            and the earth appeared below with azure14 sand ; and pale <lb/>
            fear seized them. We indeed looked to this, fearing destruc­ <lb/>
            tion. And Scylla in the mean time took six of my companions <lb/>
            from the hollow ship, who were best in their hands and their <lb/>
            strength. And looking to the swift ship and to my com­ <lb/>
            panions at the same time, I now perceived the feet and hands <lb/>
            above of them raised on high ; and calling out, they addressed <lb/>
            me by my name, there for the last time, sorrowing at heart. <note type="footnote"> 12 Cf.

            As when on a jutting rock a fisherman with a very long rod <lb/>
            throwing food as a snare for little fisheb, sends the horn of a <lb/>
            rustic ox into the sea, and then snatching it [a fish] up, throws <lb/>
            it out panting; so they panting were raised up to the rocks: and <lb/>
            there at the door she fed upon them crying out, stretching out <lb/>
            their hands to me in dreadful calamity. That of a truth was <lb/>
            the most miserable of all the things that I witnessed with <lb/>
            mine eyes, whatever I suffered, searching out the ways of the <lb/>
            sea.</p>
          <p>" But when we escaped the rocks, both terrible Charybdis <lb/>
            and Scylla, we came immediately afterwards to the blame- . <lb/>
            less island of the god ; there were beautiful oxen with wide <lb/>
            foreheads, and many fat sheep of the Sun that journeys above. <lb/>
            Then I, still going on the sea in a black ship, heard the low­ <lb/>
            ing of oxen in stalls, and the bleating of sheep: and there <lb/>
            came into my mind the word of the blind prophet, Theban <lb/>
            Tiresias, and of Ææsan Circe, who charged me very often to <lb/>
            avoid the island of the mortal-rejoicing Sun. Then I ad­ <lb/>
            dressed my companions, sorrowing in my heart:</p>
          <p>" ' Hear my words, O companions, although suffering evils, <lb/>
            that I may tell you the oracles of Tiresias, and of Ææan Circe, <lb/>
            who charged me very often to avoid the island of the Sun that <lb/>
            journeys above ; for she said that from hence would be a most <lb/>
            terrible evil unto us. But drive the black ship beyond the <lb/>
            island.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; but their dear heart was broken down. And <lb/>
            Eurylochus immediately answered me with a harsh speech; <lb/>
            ' Thou art severe, O Ulysses ; thou hast exceeding might, nor <lb/>
            art thou fatigued as to your limbs; surely all of them are of <lb/>
            iron, [since] thou dost not suffer thy companions, wearied out <lb/>
            with toil, and [oppressed with] sleep,15 to go upon the land, <lb/>
            where we may again prepare an agreeable supper in the <lb/>
            sea-girt island; but thou commandest us to wander in vain <lb/>
            through the swift night, straying from the island in the <lb/>
            misty sea. During the nights troublesome winds arise, the <lb/>
            destruction of ships: how could any one escape from utter <lb/>
            ' destruction, if a storm of wind should by chance come on a <lb/>
            sudden, either from the South or hard-blowing West, which <lb/>
            especially destroy ships, against the will of the gods, who are <lb/>
            kings ? But let us indeed now obey black night, and let us <note type="footnote"> 15 I follow Clarke's interpretation. See Loewe. </note> <pb n="171"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="292—334."/> <lb/>
            get ready supper, remaining near the swift ship; and, em­ <lb/>
            barking in the morning, let us enter on the wide sea.'</p>
          <p>" Thus spoke Eurylochus; and my other companions ap­ <lb/>
            proved : and then I knew that the deity meditated evils : and <lb/>
            addressing him I spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>"' O Eurylochus, surely now ye compel me much, being <lb/>
            alone; but come, all of you, now swear a strong oath to me, <lb/>
            if we find any herd of oxen, or great flock of sheep, no one <lb/>
            will kill either ox, or even sheep, through his infatuation: <lb/>
            but quiet do ye eat the food which immortal Circe gave us.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke ; and they immediately swore as I com­ <lb/>
            manded : but when they had sworn and finished the oath, we <lb/>
            stationed the well-made ship in the hollow port, near the <lb/>
            sweet water: and my companions went out of the ship, and <lb/>
            then skilfully prepared supper. But when they had taken <lb/>
            away the desire of drinking and eating, then calling to mind <lb/>
            their dear companions whom Scylla eat, having taken them out <lb/>
            from the black ship, they wept; and sweet sleep came upon <lb/>
            them weeping. But when it was the third part of the night, <lb/>
            and the stars went down, cloud-collecting Jove raised against <lb/>
            us a strong wind, with a mighty whirlwind, and covered earth <lb/>
            and heaven at the same time with clouds; and night arose <lb/>
            from heaven. But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered <lb/>
            morning, appeared, we moored our ship, drawing it into a hol­ <lb/>
            low cave; there were the beautiful dancing-places and the <lb/>
            seats of Nymphs; and then I, having formed an assembly, <lb/>
            spoke unto them all:</p>
          <p>"' O my friends, there is food and drink in the swift ship; <lb/>
            but let us abstain from the oxen, lest we suffer any thing. <lb/>
            For these are the oxen and fat sheep of a dread god, the Sun, <lb/>
            who overlooks all things, and hears all things.'</p>
          <p>" Thus I spoke; and their noble mind was persuaded. But <lb/>
            the South wind blew without ceasing for a whole month, nor <lb/>
            was there any other wind afterwards except the East and <lb/>
            South. But they, whilst they had food and red wine, so long <lb/>
            abstained from the oxen, being desirous of life: but when all <lb/>
            the provisions were now consumed out of the ship, then wan­ <lb/>
            dering of necessity they followed after booty, fish and birds, <lb/>
            acceptable, whatever came to their hands, with crooked <lb/>
            hooks : but hunger wore down their belly. Then I went away <lb/>
            through the island, that I might pray to the gods, if any one <pb n="172"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="335—313."/> <lb/>
            would show me the way to return. But when now I avoided <lb/>
            my companions, going through the island, having washed my <lb/>
            hands where there was a shelter from the wind, I made vows <lb/>
            to all the gods who inhabit Olympus: and they poured sweet <lb/>
            sleep over my eyebrows. But Eurylochus was the beginner <lb/>
            of evil counsel unto my companions.</p>
          <p>" ' Hear my words, O companions, although suffering evils : <lb/>
            all deaths are hateful to wretched mortals ; but, through <lb/>
            hunger, it is most miserable to die and draw on one's fate. <lb/>
            But come, having driven away the best of the oxen of the <lb/>
            Sun, we will sacrifice to the immortals who possess the wide <lb/>
            heaven. But if we come to Ithaca, our father-land, we will <lb/>
            immediately build a rich temple to the Sun, who journeys on <lb/>
            high, where we may place many and excellent images. But <lb/>
            if by any means wrathful on account of the straight-horned <lb/>
            oxen, he should wish to destroy our ship, and the other gods <lb/>
            follow, I had rather at once lose my life gaping in the wave, <lb/>
            than waste away any longer, remaining on a desert island.'</p>
          <p>" Thus spoke Eurylochus ; and my other companions ap­ <lb/>
            proved. But immediately having driven the best of the oxen <lb/>
            of the Sun from near at hand, (for the beautiful black oxen, <lb/>
            with their broad foreheads, pastured not far away from the <lb/>
            dark-prowed ship,) they stood around them, and prayed to <lb/>
            the gods, having cropped the tender leaves of a lofty-tressed <lb/>
            oak ; for they had not white barley on the well-benched ship.</p>
          <p>" But when they had prayed, and slain and skinned them, <lb/>
            they cut off the thighs, and covered them with fat, doubling <lb/>
            them, and they set the raw parts upon them: nor had they <lb/>
            wine to make libations over the burnt sacrifices, but making <lb/>
            libations with water, they roasted all the entrails. But when <lb/>
            they had burnt the thighs, and tasted the bowels, they cut up <lb/>
            the other parts, and fixed them on spits : and then sweet sleep <lb/>
            rushed away from my eyebrows: and I hastened to the swift <lb/>
            ship and the shore of the sea. But as I was now going near <lb/>
            the ship rowed on both sides, then the sweet vapour of the <lb/>
            fat came upon me: and mourning, I cried out to the immortal <lb/>
            gods:</p>
          <p>" ' O father Jove, and ye other blessed gods, who exist <lb/>
            for ever, certainly ye laid me to sleep in a pitiless sleep, to my <lb/>
            harm, but my companions remaining here have devised a <lb/>
            heinous deed.' <pb n="173"/>
            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="54—415."/>
          <p>" But quickly to the Sun, who journeys above, came Lam­ <lb/>
            petia, wearing a large garment, as a messenger, that we (my <lb/>
            companions) had slain his oxen. And he immediately ad­ <lb/>
            dressed the immortals, enraged at heart:</p>
          <p>" ' O father Jove, and ye other blessed gods, who exist for <lb/>
            ever, punish the companions of Ulysses, the son of Laertes, <lb/>
            who have insolently slain mine oxen, in which I rejoiced both <lb/>
            coming to the starry heaven, and turning back again to earth <lb/>
            from heaven. But if they do not repay me a proper return <lb/>
            for my oxen, I will go down to Pluto's, and will shine amongst <lb/>
            the dead.'</p>
          <p>"But him cloud-collecting Jove answering addressed: 'O <lb/>
            Sun, do thou by all means shine amongst the immortals and <lb/>
            mortal men, over the fruitful plain. And then I, striking a <lb/>
            little their swift ship with a white thunderbolt, will quickly <lb/>
            cleave it in the middle of the dark sea.'</p>
          <p>" But these things I heard from fair-haired Calypso ; and <lb/>
            she said that she had heard them from the messenger Mer­ <lb/>
            cury. But when I came to the ship and the sea, I chided <lb/>
            them one after another, standing near them, nor could we find <lb/>
            any remedy; for the oxen were now dead. Then the gods <lb/>
            immediately showed prodigies to them ; the skins crawled, and <lb/>
            the flesh lowed on the spits, both roast and raw; and there <lb/>
            was a voice as of oxen. For six days then my beloved com­ <lb/>
            panions feasted, driving away the best of the oxen of the Sun: <lb/>
            but when Jove, the son of Saturn, brought on the seventh <lb/>
            day, then the wind ceased raging with a tempest: and we, <lb/>
            straightway embarking, committed ourselves to the wide sea: <lb/>
            having erected the mast and drawn up the white sails.</p>
          <p>" But when we had now left the island, nor did any other land <lb/>
            appear, but the heaven and the sea, then the son of Saturn <lb/>
            reared an azure cloud above the hollow ship ; and the sea be­ <lb/>
            came dark beneath it. But it ran for no very long time ; for <lb/>
            immediately came the clamouring West wind, rushing with a <lb/>
            mighty tempest: and the storm of the wind broke both the <lb/>
            cables of the mast; and the mast fell backwards, and all the <lb/>
            tackle was thrown in confusion into the hold ; and he struck <lb/>
            the head of the helmsman backward in the ship, and broke all <lb/>
            the bones of his head together; and he fell like unto a diver <lb/>
            from the deck, and his noble mind left his bones; and Jove <lb/>
            thundered together, and hurled a thunderbolt upon the ship: <pb n="174"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="416-453"/> <lb/>
            and it was entirely whirled round, stricken with the thunder­ <lb/>
            bolt of Jove, and it was filled with sulphur; and my com­ <lb/>
            panions fell from the ship. And they, like unto gulls, were <lb/>
            borne on the waves around the black ship; for the deity took <lb/>
            away their return. But I kept going about through the ship, <lb/>
            until the storm loosed the sides from the keel ; and the wave <lb/>
            bore it along naked.15 And it broke out the mast at the keel: <lb/>
            but a thong was thrown upon it, made from the skin of an <lb/>
            ox. With this I bound both together, the keel and the mast: <lb/>
            and sitting upon them I was borne by the destructive winds.</p>
          <p>" Then indeed the West wind ceased raging with a storm, <lb/>
            and quickly the South wind came on, bringing grief to my <lb/>
            mind, that I should again measure my way to destructive <lb/>
            Charybdis. I was borne along during the whole night; and <lb/>
            together with the rising sun I came to the rock of Scylla, and <lb/>
            terrible Charybdis. She gulped up the briny water of the <lb/>
            sea; but I, raised on high to the lofty fig-tree, held clinging <lb/>
            to it, as a bat, nor could I any where either fix myself firmly <lb/>
            with my feet, or ascend: for the roots were far off. and the <lb/>
            branches were wide apart, and both long and vast, and they <lb/>
            overshadowed Charybdis. But I held without ceasing, until <lb/>
            she vomited out again the mast and keel; and it came late to <lb/>
            me wishing for it: as late as a man has risen from the forum <lb/>
            to go to supper, adjudging many contests of disputing youths, <lb/>
            so late these planks appeared from Charybdis. And I put <lb/>
            down my feet, and my hands over them, to be carried along, <lb/>
            and I fell with a noise in the middle on the long planks, and <lb/>
            sitting upon them, I rowed with my hands. Nor did the <lb/>
            father of men and of gods permit Scylla to behold me any <lb/>
            more ; for I could not have escaped bitter destruction. From <lb/>
            thence I was borne along nine days; but in the tenth night <lb/>
            the gods drove me to the island Ogygia; where fair-haired <lb/>
            Calypso dwelt, an awful goddess, possessing human speech, <lb/>
            who received me kindly, and took care of me. Why should <lb/>
            I recount these things to thee ? for I have already related <lb/>
            them yesterday in thine house, to thee and thy illustrious <lb/>
            wife; but it is hateful to me to recount again things that <lb/>
            have been'told full plainly." <note type="footnote"> Is So Horace, " nudum rimigio latus." </note> <pb n="175"/>

          <p>Having concluded his narrative, Ulysses is carried asleep to Ithaca by tho <lb/>
            Phæacians, and put on shore with the presents he had received from them. <lb/>
            Neptune, as had been foretold, transforms the ship into a rock just before <lb/>
            its arrival in Phæacia. Minerva meets Ulysses and converses with him <lb/>
            respecting the destruction of the suitors ; she then hides his treasures in <lb/>
            cave, and transforms Ulysses into an old man.</p>
          <p>THUS he spoke; but they all became still in silence, and were <lb/>
            possessed with soothing delight in the shady palace. But him <lb/>
            Alcinous answered in turn, and addressed [him ] :</p>
          <p>" O Ulysses, since thou hast come to my brazen-founded, <lb/>
            lofty-roofed house, therefore I think that thou wilt return <lb/>
            back, not wandering at all back again, although thou hast <lb/>
            suffered very many things. But to each man of you I speak <lb/>
            these things, charging you, as many of you as constantly <lb/>
            drink the dark honorary 1 wine in my palace, and listen to the <lb/>
            bard : there already lie garments for the stranger in a well- <lb/>
            polished chest, and much-wrought gold, and all other presents, <lb/>
            whatever the senators of the Phæacians have brought here ; <lb/>
            but come, let us give to him a large tripod and cauldron, each <lb/>
            man ;2 but we again will pay it back, being assembled among 3 <lb/>
            he people, for it is a difficult thing for one to give as a <lb/>
            present." 4</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Alcinous ; and his words pleased them. And <lb/>
            each of them went home about to sleep. But when the mother <lb/>
            lof dawn, rosy-fingered morning, appeared, they hastened to the <lb/>
            ship, and brought man-strengthening brass; and the sacred <lb/>
            might of Alcinous arranged these things well, he himself going <lb/>
            thorough the ship under the benches, lest they should hurt any <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">γερούσιον οι̃νον</foreign>, " the best, richest wine," served up to the senators <lb/>

            of his companions who were driving on, when they hastened <lb/>
            with their oars. But they went to Alcinous's,5 and made ready <lb/>
            a feast And the sacred might of Alcinous sacrificed an ox <lb/>
            for them to Jove, the dark-clouded son of Saturn, who rules <lb/>
            over all. And burning the thighs, they banqueted a glorious <lb/>
            banquet, delighting themselves : and amongst them the divine <lb/>
            bard sang, Demodocus, honoured by the people : but Ulysses <lb/>
            frequently turned his head towards the shining sun, anxious <lb/>
            for it to go down ; for now he desired to return. And as <lb/>
            when a man is longing for his supper, for whom during the <lb/>
            whole day two dun steers have drawn the compact plough <lb/>
            through a fallow, and welcome to him the light of the sun is <lb/>
            setting, that he may go to supper, and his knees are hurt as he , <lb/>
            goes: so welcome to Ulysses did the light of the sun set. And <lb/>
            he immediately conversed with the oar-loving Phæsaciaus, and <lb/>
            addressing Alcinous especially, he spoke words:</p>
          <p>" O King Alcinous, most glorious of all the people, having <lb/>
            made libations, do ye send me unharmed,6 and yourselves <lb/>
            farewell: for now are the things completed which my dear <lb/>
            mind wished, an escort and friendly gifts, which may the <lb/>
            heavenly gods make prosperous for me: and returning, m <lb/>
            I find my spotless wife at home, with my friends, in safely. <lb/>
            But do ye, remaining here, delight your virgin-wedded wives <lb/>
            and children ; and may the gods accord them every kind of <lb/>
            virtue; and may there be no public evil."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, and they all approved, and ordered them to <lb/>
            send the stranger, since he had spoken rightly. And the n <lb/>
            Alcinous addressed the herald :</p>
          <p>" O Pontonous, having mixed a cup, distribute wine to all <lb/>
            in the palace: that having prayed to father Jove, we ma <lb/>
            send the stranger to his paternal land."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but Pontonous mixed the sweet wine, a <lb/>
            distributed it to all in succession ; 7 but they made libations to <note type="footnote"> 5 I have imitated the ellipse in the original. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Where the former prose translator got the words " as you have <lb/>

            the blessed gods who possess the wide heaven, in the same <lb/>
            place from their seats; and divine Ulysses rose up, and he <lb/>
            placed the round cup in the hands of Arete, and addressing <lb/>
            her, spoke winged words :</p>
          <p>" Farewell, O queen, continually, until old age comes, and <lb/>
            death, which happen to men. But I am going, and do thou <lb/>
            be delighted in this house with thy children, and the people, <lb/>
            and king Alcinous."</p>
          <p>Thus speaking, divine Ulysses went over the threshold ; but <lb/>
            with him the strength of Alcinous sent forward a herald, to <lb/>
            conduct him to the swift ship and the shore of the sea. And <lb/>
            Arete sent women servants with him; one having a well- <lb/>
            washed robe, and garment, and another she sent with him to <lb/>
            carry a heavy coffer: and another carried both bread and red <lb/>
            wine. But when they came to the ship and the sea, his illus­ <lb/>
            trious conductors immediately receiving the things, placed <lb/>
            them in the hollow ship, all the drink and meat: and then <lb/>
            they strewed a rug and linen for Ulysses, on the deck of the <lb/>
            hollow ship, that he might sleep without waking,8 at the stern ; <lb/>
            but he himself embarked and laid down in silence; and each <lb/>
            of them sat on the benches in order ; and they loosed the cable <lb/>
            from the perforated stone: 9 there they, reclining, threw up <lb/>
            the sea with the oar, and sweet sleep fell upon his eyelids, un­ <lb/>
            wakeful, most pleasant, the nearest like death. But it,10 like <lb/>
            as four-yoked male horses in the plain, all incited together by <lb/>
            the blows of the scourge, lifting themselves on high, swiftly <lb/>
            pass over the way ; so its prow indeed lifted itself up, and the <lb/>
            mighty purple billow of the much-rolling sea rushed behind, <lb/>
            And very safely it ran, steadily: nor could a falcon-hawk, <lb/>
            Swiftest of birds, have followed it close. So it running swiftly <lb/>
            meut the waves of the sea, bearing a man who possessed coun­ <lb/>
            thels equal to the gods: who before had suffered very many <lb/>
            griefs in his mind, both wars of men, and passing the terrible <lb/>
            waves: then indeed he slept fearlessly, forgetting whatever <lb/>
            things he had suffered.</p>

              annonncing the light of the morning, the mother of day; at that<lb/>
              time then the ship passes over the sea neared the island.</p>
          <p>Now there is a certain haven of Phorcys, the old man of the<lb/>
            sea, amongst the peoples of Ithaca; and there are two abrupt<lb/>
            projecting shores in it, inclining towards the port, 11 which<lb/>
            swell from the great wave 12 of hard blowing winds from with-<lb/>
            out; but within well-benched ships remain without a chain,<lb/>
            when they reach the goal of the mooring-station. But at the<lb/>
            head of the port there is a large-leafed olive; and near it a<lb/>
            delightful cave, shaded, sacred to the Nymphs, who are called<lb/>
            Naïds. And there are stone cups and casks int it; and there<lb/>
            then the bees stow away their honey. 13 And in it there are<lb/>
            stone distaffs of a great length, and there the Nymphs 14 weave<lb/>
            their sea-purple robes, a marvel to behold. And in it there<lb/>
            are perpetual flowing waters; 15 and it has two doors : these<lb/>
            to the North to be descended by men, but those on the other<lb/>
            hand, to the South, are more sacred; nor do men enter at all<lb/>
            by that way; but it is the way of the immortals.</p>
          <p>There they drove in, being before acquainted with it; it 16<lb/>
            indeed ran ashore more than half its length, hastening; for by<lb/>
            the hands of such rowers was it urged on. And they disem-<lb/>

              by chance any one of way-faring men coming should do them <lb/>
              harm before Ulysses awoke. And they themselves went <lb/>
              home again ; nor did Neptune forget the threats with which <lb/>
              he first threatened godlike Ulysses; but he asked the counsel <lb/>
              of Jove:</p>
          <p>“ O father Jove, no longer shall I be honoured amongst <lb/>
            the immortal gods, since mortals do not honour me, the Phæa­ <lb/>
            cians, who are however of my race. For I just now said <lb/>
            that Ulysses should come home, having suffered many ills; <lb/>
            but I by no means took away his return altogether, since <lb/>
            thou first didst promise and grant it. But they, having taken <lb/>
            him asleep over the sea in a swift ship, have placed him in <lb/>
            Ithaca, and given him abundance of gifts, plenty of brass and <lb/>
            gold, and a woven garment, as many things as Ulysses would <lb/>
            never have taken from Troy, if he had returned unharmed, <lb/>
            having obtained by lot his share of the booty."</p>
          <p>But him cloud-compelling Jove answering addressed: <lb/>
            " Alas! powerful Neptune, what hast thou said ? the gods <lb/>
            by no means dishonour thee ; difficult would it be to aim at <lb/>
            the oldest and most excellent with insults. But if any one of <lb/>
            men, yielding to violence and strength, does not honour thee, <lb/>
            thou hast always the means of revenge hereafter. Do as thou <lb/>
            wilt, and as is dear to thy mind."</p>
          <p>But him earth-shaking Neptune immediately answered: <lb/>
            , I would quickly do as thou advise, O thou black-clouded <lb/>
            one: but thy wrath I always hold in awe and avoid. Now <lb/>
            then I wish to destroy the beautiful ship of the Phæacians, <lb/>
            returning from the escort [of Ulysses] on the misty sea, that <lb/>
            now they may abstain and cease from the escort of men: and <lb/>
            that a mighty mountain should cover their city around."</p>
          <p>But him cloud-compelling Jove answering addressed : <lb/>
            “ My friend, thus indeed to my mind it seems to be best. <lb/>
            When all the people from the city are now looking to it driv­ <lb/>
            in- along, place a stone near the land like unto a swift ship, <lb/>
            that all men may marvel; and that a great mountain may <lb/>
            cover their city around."</p>
          <p>But when earth-shaking Neptune heard this, he hastened <lb/>
            to Scheria, where the Phæacians are born, he remained <lb/>
            there; and the sea-traversing ship came very near, swiftly <lb/>
            making its way: and the Earth-shaker came near it, who <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <pb n="180"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="161—203."/> <lb/>
            made it a stone, and rooted it below, striking it with his <lb/>
            hand laid flat17 downwards ; and he went to a distance. But <lb/>
            they, the long-oared Phæaeians, men illustrious at sea, spoke <lb/>
            winged words to one another. And thus some one said, look­ <lb/>
            ing to another near him :</p>
          <p>" Alas, who has bound the swift ship in the sea while driv­ <lb/>
            ing home? just now it all appeared before us." Thus some <lb/>
            one said; but they knew not how these things were done. <lb/>
            And Alcinous harangued and addressed them :</p>
          <p>" Alas,18 surely now upon me are come the oracles uttered <lb/>
            of old by my sire, who said that Neptune would be wrath with <lb/>
            us, because we are safe conductors of all men. He said that <lb/>
            some time or other he would destroy a very beautiful ship of <lb/>
            the Phæacian men when returning home from an escort in the <lb/>
            misty sea, and that a great mountain should cover the city <lb/>
            around. Thus the old man spoke, and all these things are <lb/>
            now accomplished. But come, let us all obey, as I com­ <lb/>
            mand. Cease from the conduct of men, when any one comes <lb/>
            to our city; and we will sacrifice twelve chosen bulls to <lb/>
            Neptune, if he would pity us, and a great mountain may not <lb/>
            cover our city around."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and they feared, and got ready the bulls. <lb/>
            Thus the leaders and chiefs of the people of the Phæaeians <lb/>
            prayed to King Neptune, standing near the altar. But divine <lb/>
            Ulysses awoke sleeping on his paternal land : nor did he know <lb/>
            it, having been a long time absent; for the deity, Pallas Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva, the daughter of Jove, shed a mist around him; that <lb/>
            she might make him unknown, and might tell him every thing, <lb/>
            that his wife might not know him, and his citizens and friends, <lb/>
            before he had taken revenge for all their transgression upon <lb/>
            the suitors. Therefore all things appeared of a different form <lb/>
            to the king, both the long roads, and all-sheltering ports, and <lb/>
            the sun-traversed rocks, and flourishing trees.</p>
          <p>And he stood, having risen up in haste, and beheld his pater­ <lb/>
            nal land; and then he mourned, and struck his thighs with <lb/>
            his hands laid flat downwards; and lamenting spoke thus:</p>
          <p>" Woe is me to the land of what mortals am I come ? are <lb/>
            they indeed injurious and fierce, nor just ? or are they kind to <lb/>
            strangers, and is their mind godlike ? Where now shall I bear <note type="footnote"> 17 On the contracted form <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταπρηνεῖ</foreign> see Thiersch, Gk. Gr. p. 384, 30-</note><note type="footnote"> 18 See my note on i. 32. </note> <pb n="181"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="20—243."/> <lb/>
            these many possessions ? and where do I myself wander ? would <lb/>
            that I had remained there with the Phæacians ; I indeed might <lb/>
            have come to some other powerful king, who would have en­ <lb/>
            tertained me, and escorted me so as to return. But now I <lb/>
            know not where to place them ; I will not indeed leave them <lb/>
            here, lest they become a booty to others. Alas ! the leaders <lb/>
            and chiefs of the Phæaeians were not wise nor just in every <lb/>
            thing, who have taken me away to another land ; they said in <lb/>
            truth that they would take me to western 19 Ithaca,20 but have <lb/>
            not performed [their promise]. May suppliant Jove exact <lb/>
            vengeance on them, who also regards other men, and punishes <lb/>
            whoever errs. But come, I will now count the possessions, <lb/>
            and see whether they have gone, taking away any thing in the <lb/>
            hollow ship."</p>
          <p>Having thus spoken, he numbered the beautiful tripods and <lb/>
            cauldrons, and the gold, and the beautiful woven garments; <lb/>
            of these he missed none ; but he lamented his paternal land, <lb/>
            creeping along the shore of the much-rolling sea, bewailing <lb/>
            much. But Minerva came near him, like in person unto a <lb/>
            young man, a shepherd of sheep, very delicate, and as are the <lb/>
            sons of kings, having a double well-wrought cloak about her <lb/>
            shoulders; and she had sandals under her soft feet, and a <lb/>
            javelin in her hand : Ulysses rejoiced seeing her, and came to <lb/>
            meet her, and addressing her, spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" O friend, since I meet thee first in this country, hail, and <lb/>
            do not thou meet me at all with an evil mind ; but preserve <lb/>
            these things, and preserve me ; for I entreat thee, as a god, <lb/>
            and come to thy dear knees. And tell me these things truly, <lb/>
            that I may be well informed, what land is this ? what people ? <lb/>
            what men are born here? is it some western island? or does <lb/>
            some shore of the very fruitful continent lie inclined towards <lb/>
            the sea ?"</p>
          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva addressed in turn : <lb/>
            " Thou art foolish, O stranger, or thou hast come from a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, if indeed thou inquirest of this land : it is not by any <lb/>
            means so nameless; but very many know it, both as many as <lb/>
            dwell towards the East and the Sun, and as many as [dwell] <lb/>
            behind towards the misty darkness. It is rough indeed, <lb/>
            not fit for driving horses, yet not very barren, but it is not <note type="footnote"> 10 Or " sunny." Of. Buttm. Lexil. p. 224, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> 20See Stal. on Æsch. Suppl, 1 Hemstech. on Ludar, Tim. sub imit. </note> <pb n="182"/>

            spacious. For in it there is abundance of w eat, and there <lb/>
            is wine; and still the shower and flourishing dew possess it. <lb/>
            It is excellent for feeding goats and oxen ; there is every kind <lb/>
            of wood, and there are perpetual irrigations in it. Therefore <lb/>
            indeed, O stranger, the name of Ithaca would reach even to <lb/>
            Troy, which they say is far from the Grecian land."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but much-enduring divine Ulysses was <lb/>
            glad, rejoicing in his own paternal land, as Pallas Minerva, <lb/>
            the daughter of Ægis-bearing Jove, told him. And address­ <lb/>
            ing her, he spoke winged words, nor did he say what was <lb/>
            true, but he took up discourse the contrary way, even revolv­ <lb/>
            ing crafty design in his breast.</p>
          <p>" I heard of Ithaca even in spacious Crete, far over the sea ; <lb/>
            but now I am myself come with these chattels : but I am fly­ <lb/>
            ing away, having left as many things for my children, since I <lb/>
            have slain the dear son of Idomeneus, swift-footed Orsilochus, <lb/>
            who in spacious Crete excelled enterprising men with his <lb/>
            swift feet: because he wished to deprive me of all my Trojan <lb/>
            booty, on account of which I suffered griefs in my mind, both <lb/>
            wars of men, and passing over the terrible waves, because I <lb/>
            did not serve his father amongst the people of the Trojans, <lb/>
            gratifying him, but I ruled over other companions. Him in­ <lb/>
            deed I struck with a brazen spear, as he was coming home from <lb/>
            the country, lying in wait for him near the road with a com­ <lb/>
            panion. But very dark night possessed heaven, nor did any <lb/>
            one of men perceive us ; but I escaped his notice, taking away <lb/>
            his mind.21 But when I had slain him with the sharp brass, <lb/>
            I immediately going in a ship to the illustrious Phæacians, <lb/>
            besought them, and gave them booty gratifying their mind. <lb/>
            Them I requested to carry me, and place me at Pylos, or to di­ <lb/>
            vine Elis, where the Epeans rule. But in truth the force of the <lb/>
            wind thrust them from thence, much against their will ; nor <lb/>
            did they wish to deceive [me]. But wandering from thence <lb/>
            we came here by night; and with exertion we rowed into the <lb/>
            port, nor to us was there any mention of supper, although <lb/>
            much wanting to obtain it: but all of us going out of the ship <lb/>
            at random22 laid down. Here sweet sleep came upon me <lb/>
            wearied. But they, taking my chattels out of the hollow <lb/>
            ship, laid them down, even where I myself was lying on the <note type="footnote"> n i. e. his life. </note> <note type="footnote"> 12 Hesych. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾰυτως, μάτην</foreign> </note> <pb n="183"/>

            sands : and they embarking went to well-mhabited Sidonia ; <lb/>
            but I was left, sorrowing at heart."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke: but the blue-eyed goddess Minerva smiled, <lb/>
            and stroked him down with the hand; but she became in her <lb/>
            person like a woman, both fair, and large, and skilled in splen­ <lb/>
            did works ; and addressing him she spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" Cunning would he be and deceitful, whoever should sur­ <lb/>
            pass thee in all kinds of craft, even if a god should meet thee. <lb/>
            O thou hard one, various in plans, insatiable in deceit, thou <lb/>
            wert not about, even when in thine own land, to cease from <lb/>
            thy deceits, and crafty words, which are dear to thee from thy <lb/>
            birth.23 But come, let us no longer speak of these things, <lb/>
            since we are both skilled in cunning; for thou art the best of <lb/>
            all mortals in counsel and words ; but I am celebrated amongst <lb/>
            all the gods for my judgment and cunning; didst thou not <lb/>
            know Pallas Minerva, the daughter of Jove, [me] who always <lb/>
            stand by thee in all labours, and guard thee, and have made <lb/>
            thee dear unto all the Phaeacians ? But now I am come here <lb/>
            that I may weave some counsel with thee, and may hide the <lb/>
            possessions, whatsoever the illustrious Phæacians have given <lb/>
            thee, returning home by my counsel and mind. And that I <lb/>
            may tell thee what sorrows it is fated for thee to endure in thy <lb/>
            built house; but do thou endure them even by necessity, nor <lb/>
            tell any one, either of all men or women, that thou hast come <lb/>
            wandering; but in silence suffer many griefs, sustaining the <lb/>
            violence of men."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses in answer addressed: <lb/>
            " It is difficult, O goddess, for a man who meets thee to know <lb/>
            thee, although he be very skilful; for thou makest thyself like <lb/>
            unto every one. But I know this well, that thou wert before <lb/>
            kind to me, while we sons of the Grecians fought in Troy. <lb/>
            But when we had destroyed the lofty city of Priam, and em­ <lb/>
            barked in our ships, and the deity dispersed the Grecians, I <lb/>
            did not afterwards behold thee, nor did I perceive thee em­ <lb/>
            barking on my ship, that thou mightest avert any grief from <lb/>
            me. [But I was continually wandering, having my heart <lb/>
            overcome in my mind, until the gods freed me from mis­ <lb/>
            chiefs ; before thou didst encourage me with thy words in the <note type="footnote"> 23 Literally, " from the plain," a metaphor derived from plants. See <lb/>
            the Schol. and Eustath. Hesychius interprets it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀοΧη̃θεν, ἐκ ῥἱζης, ἀϰὸ <lb/>

            the city.] But now, by thy father, I entreat thee, for I do <lb/>
            not think that I am come to western Ithaca, but am now in <lb/>
            some other land: but I think that thou sayest these things, <lb/>
            mocking me, that thou mayest deceive my mind. Tell me if <lb/>
            in truth I am come to my dear country."</p>
          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva immediately an­ <lb/>
            swered : " Thou hast ever such a thought in thy breast: there <lb/>
            fore I cannot leave thee, who art unhappy, because thou art <lb/>
            a man of words, and shrewd, and prudent. For any other man <lb/>
            gladly returning from wandering would desire to see his chil­ <lb/>
            dren and wife in his palace; but it is not yet agreeable for <lb/>
            thee to know or inquire, before thou shalt make some trial of <lb/>
            thy wife, who in vain sits in thy palace, but unto her mourning <lb/>
            the nights and days always waste away. But I never mistrusted <lb/>
            this, but knew in my mind that thou wouldst return, having <lb/>
            lost all thy companions. But I did not wish to contend with <lb/>
            my uncle Neptune, who had set wrath against thee in his <lb/>
            mind, enraged, because thou didst blind his dear son. But <lb/>
            come, I will show thee the seat of Ithaca, that thou mayest <lb/>
            believe. This is the port of Phorcys, the old man of the sea: <lb/>
            and this is the large-leafed olive at the head of the port, land <lb/>
            near it there is a delightful shadowy cave, sacred to the <lb/>
            Nymphs who are called Naïds]. But this is the wide-covered <lb/>
            cave, where thou didst sacrifice many perfect hecatombs to <lb/>
            the Nymphs: and this is Neritos, a mountain clothed with <lb/>
            wood."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, the goddess dispersed the mist; and <lb/>
            the earth appeared: and much-enduring divine Ulysses was <lb/>
            then glad, rejoicing in his own land: and he kissed the <lb/>
            bounteous plain. And immediately uplifting his hands, he <lb/>
            prayed to the Nymphs.</p>
          <p>" O Naïd Nymphs, ye daughters of Jove, I never though <lb/>
            that I should behold you ; but now I salute you with mild <lb/>
            prayers: but we will also give gifts, even as before, if the <lb/>
            daughter of Jove, the huntress, will willingly permit both <lb/>
            myself to live, and will make my dear son increase."</p>
          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva addressed in turn : <lb/>
            " Be confident, let not these things be a care to thee in thy <lb/>
            Mind. But come, let us now straightway put the chattels <lb/>
            in the recess of the divine cave, that even these may remain <pb n="185"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="364-402."/> <lb/>
            here safe: and let us then consult, in what way things may <lb/>
            best be done."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, the goddess descended the dark cave, <lb/>
            seeking hiding-places through the cave; but Ulysses carried <lb/>
            all the things near, the gold, and the brass not worn down, <lb/>
            and the well-made garments, which the Phæacians had given <lb/>
            him. And he set them well in order; and Pallas Minerva, <lb/>
            daughter of Ӕgis-bearing Jove, placed a stone against the door. <lb/>
            And they sitting down near the roots of the sacred olive, <lb/>
            plotted destruction against the overbearing suitors. And the <lb/>
            blue-eyed goddess Minerva began a discourse to him :</p>
          <p>“ O Jove-born son of Laertes, much-planning Ulysses, <lb/>
            consider how thou mayest lay thy hands upon the shameless <lb/>
            suitors, who now for three years are lording it over thy palace, <lb/>
            wooing thy godlike wife, and giving her bridal gifts. But <lb/>
            she, ever lamenting in her mind for thy return, gives hopes <lb/>
            to all, and makes promises to each man, sending forth mes­ <lb/>
            sages to them; but her mind meditates other things."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            “ O gods, surely I was now about to perish in my palace, <lb/>
            after the evil fate of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, hadst not <lb/>
            thou, O goddess, told me every thing rightly. But come, <lb/>
            weave a counsel, how I may be revenged on them: and do <lb/>
            thou thyself stand near me, putting confident courage within <lb/>
            me, such as when we destroyed the noble head-gear 24 of Troy. <lb/>
            If thou wouldst stand near me thus eager, O blue-eyed one, I <lb/>
            would fight even with three hundred men, together with thee, <lb/>
            O venerable goddess, when thou wouldst readily assist me."</p>
          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva then answered: <lb/>
            " I indeed will be present with thee, nor shalt thou escape my <lb/>
            notice, when indeed we shall have prepared these things, and I <lb/>
            think that some one of the suitors, who are consuming thy <lb/>
            property, will pollute the vast pavement with his blood and <lb/>
            brains. But come, I will make thee unknown to all mortals ; I <lb/>
            will wither thy beautiful skin on thy bent limbs, and will de­ <lb/>
            stroy the auburn hairs from thine head, and will put a cloak <lb/>
            around thee, which a man would loathe seeing one wear it. And <lb/>
            I will blear thine eyes, which before were beautiful, that thou <lb/>
            mayest appear unseemly to all the suitors, and to thy wife <note type="footnote"> 24 Properly, " a head-dress," but here used metaphorically for turrets. </note> <pb n="186"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="403—440."/> <lb/>
            and son, whom thou didst leave in thy palace. But do thou <lb/>
            first gai to the swineherd, who is the guardian of thy swine; <lb/>
            but however he is kindly disposed towards thee, and loves thy <lb/>
            son, and prudent Penelope. Thou wilt find him sitting with <lb/>
            the swine: and they are pastured near the rock of Corax, and <lb/>
            at the fountain Arethusa, eating strength-giving acorns, and <lb/>
            drinking muddy water, which things nourish the flourishing <lb/>
            fat in swine. Remain there, and sitting near him, inquire all <lb/>
            things of him, while I go to Sparta of fair women, to call Te­ <lb/>
            lemaehus, thy dear son, O Ulysses, who is gone to Lacedæmon <lb/>
            with wide grounds, to Menelaus, to inquire for tidings of thee, <lb/>
            if thou still art any where in existence."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            " Why didst thou not tell him, since thou knowest all things <lb/>
            in thy mind ? was it that he wandering over the barren sea <lb/>
            might suffer griefs ? but others consume his livelihood."</p>
          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva then answered: <lb/>
            " Let not him indeed be too much in thy thoughts; I myself <lb/>
            conducted him, that going there he might obtain excellent re­ <lb/>
            nown : but he has not any labour; but he sits quiet in the <lb/>
            house of the son of Atreus, and abundance lies near him. <lb/>
            Young men indeed lie in ambush for him with a black ship, <lb/>
            desiring to kill him, before he reaches his paternal land. <lb/>
            But I do not think these things [will happen], before the <lb/>
            earth detains some one [of the suitors, who are consuming <lb/>
            thy property]."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, Minerva touched him with a rod ; and <lb/>
            withered his beautiful skin on his bent limbs, and destroyed <lb/>
            the auburn hairs from his head, and put around all his limbs <lb/>
            the skin of an aged old man. And she bleared his eyes, which <lb/>
            before were beautiful. And she put around him another evil, <lb/>
            a ragged garment, and a cloak, torn, sordid, begrimed with foul <lb/>
            smoke. And she put around him a large bare skin of a swift <lb/>
            stag ; and she gave him a staff and an unseemly satchel, ragged <lb/>
            in many places; and there was a twisted thong in it to bold <lb/>
            it up.</p>
          <p>When they twain had thus consulted, they separated; she <lb/>
            indeed then went to divine Lacedæmon for the son of Ulyssis. <pb n="187"/>

          <p>Ulysses, under the guise of a beggar, arrives at the house of Eumseus, a <lb/>
            swineherd, the most faithful of his servants, who receives him hospitably. <lb/>
            He gives a feigned account of himself, stating, however, that Ulysses will <lb/>
            shortly return, pretending to have heard so from the king of the Thespro­ <lb/>
            tians. He then passes the night in the swineherd's dwelling.</p>
          <p>BUT he went from the haven by the rugged path up the <lb/>
            woody country, through the wolds, where Minerva had in­ <lb/>
            formed him the divine swineherd [would be], who chiefly, <lb/>
            among the servants whom divine Ulysses possessed, had a <lb/>
            care for his livelihood. But him he found sitting in the por­ <lb/>
            tico, where his lofty abode was built, in a conspicuous situa­ <lb/>
            tion, both beautiful and large, that could be run round,' which <lb/>
            the swineherd himself had built for his swine, when the king <lb/>
            was absent, without the knowledge of his mistress and of old <lb/>
            Laertes, with stones drawn thither,2 and he topped it with sloe ; <lb/>
            and outside he drove stakes all round here and there, close and <lb/>
            frequent, having cleft the dark part.3 And within the abode he <lb/>
            made twelve styes, near one another, beds for the swine; and <lb/>
            in each were kept4 fifty ground-wallowing swine, females for <lb/>
            breeding ;5 but the males slept without, much fewer ; for them <lb/>
            the godlike6 suitors diminished, eating them : for the swineherd <lb/>
            always sent the best of all the well-fatted swine ; but they <lb/>
            were three hundred and sixty [in number]. And near them <lb/>
            four dogs always slept, like unto wild beasts, which the swine­ <lb/>
            herd, chieftain of men,7 had nourished. But he himself about <lb/>
            his own feet was fitting shoes, cutting a bull's skin, of a beau­ <lb/>
            tiful colour; but the others had now gone each a different <lb/>
            way, three with the pasturing swine; but the fourth he had <lb/>
            sent to the city to take a sow to the overbearing suitors <lb/>
            'hrough necessity; that sacrificing they might satiate their <lb/>

          <p>But on a sudden the dogs, practised in barking,8beheld Ulys­ <lb/>
            ses, they indeed ran on clamouring; but Ulysses sat down <lb/>
            with cunning, and his staff fell from his hand : there indeed <lb/>
            he would have suffered unseemly grief at his own stall, but <lb/>
            the swineherd following quickly with his swift feet, ran <lb/>
            through the vestibule ; and the skin fell from his hand. Then <lb/>
            chiding the dogs, he drove them different ways with frequent <lb/>
            stones: and lie addressed the king :</p>
          <p>" O old man, but for a little the dogs would have destroyed <lb/>
            thee on a sudden ; and thou wouldst have poured out abuse <lb/>
            against me. And to me the gods have given other griefs and <lb/>
            sorrows; for mourning and grieving for a godlike king I sit, <lb/>
            and I nourish fat swine for others to eat; but he, perhaps de­ <lb/>
            sirous of food, wanders amongst the people and the city of <lb/>
            foreign men, if he is still alive, and beholds the light of the <lb/>
            sun. But follow, and let us go to the resting-place, O old <lb/>
            man, that thou thyself, being satisfied as to thy mind with food <lb/>
            and wine, mayest relate from whence thou art, and how many <lb/>
            griefs thou hast undergone."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, the divine swineherd led the way to <lb/>
            the resting-place. And having brought him in, he made him <lb/>
            sit down, and he put thick rushes9 under him, and he strewed <lb/>
            over it the skin of a wild shaggy10 goat, there as a couch, <lb/>
            great and thick. And Ulysses rejoiced because he had thus <lb/>
            received him ; and he spoke, and addressed [him] :</p>
          <p>" May Jove, O stranger, and the other immortal gods, give <lb/>
            thee whatever thou dost most wish, because thou hast kindly <lb/>
            received me."</p>
          <p>But him the swineherd Eumæus answering addressed: “ O <lb/>
            stranger, it is not right for me, even if a more wretched one than <lb/>
            thou shouldst. come, to dishonour a stranger ; for all strangers <lb/>
            and beggars are from Jove ; but our gift is both small and <lb/>

              fear, when young masters rule over them : for certainly the gods <lb/>
              have hindered the return of him 11 at least, who indeed loved <lb/>
              me earnestly, and would have given me possessions, such as <lb/>
              a kind master is used to give to his servant, a house, and <lb/>
              allotment, and a much-wooed wife, who has served him much, <lb/>
              and God increases12 his toil; as also for me this labour is in­ <lb/>
              creased, in which I abide. Thus my master would have pro­ <lb/>
              fited me much, if he had grown old here ; but he has perished ; <lb/>
              so I wish that the race of Helen had perished entirely, since <lb/>
              she loosed the knees of many men: for he too went on ae­ <lb/>
              count of the honour of Agamemnon to steed-surpassing Ilium, <lb/>
              that he might fight with the Trojans."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he quickly fastened his cloak with a <lb/>
            girdle ; and he hastened to the styes, where the litters of pigs <lb/>
            were kept: from thence having taken two, he brought them, <lb/>
            and sacrificed both ; and he scalded them, and cut them up, <lb/>
            and stuck them on spits. And having cooked all, then carry­ <lb/>
            ing it, he set it near Ulysses, warm on the very spits; and he <lb/>
            sprinkled white meal [over the flesh], and in an ivy cup he <lb/>
            mixed sweet wine; and he himself sat opposite him, and en­ <lb/>
            couraging addressed him:</p>
          <p>“ Eat now, O stranger, the pigs 13 which are at hand for the <lb/>
            servants; but the suitors are eating the fatted swine, not <lb/>
            thinking in their minds of observation or pity. The blessed <lb/>
            gods indeed love not impious works, but honour, justice, and <lb/>
            the righteous works of men ; and even enemies and hostile <lb/>
            men, who make incursions on a foreign land, and unto whom <lb/>
            Jove has given booty, and [who], having filled their ships, <lb/>
            have each gone home, upon these also strong fear of observation <lb/>
            falls in their minds. But they14 even somewhat know, and <lb/>
            have heard some voice of a god, [about] his miserable death, <lb/>
            since they are not willing to woo justly, nor to return to their <lb/>
            own [house] ; but securely they violently destroy his goods, nor <lb/>
            is there any sparing. For as many nights and days as are <lb/>
            from Jove, they never sacrifice even one victim or two only; <lb/>
            and they waste his wine, violently drawing it off.

            livelihood was immense, no one of heroes, either of black <lb/>
            Epirus, or Ithaca itself, possesses so much ; nor do twenty <lb/>
            men together possess so much wealth ; but I will reckon it <lb/>
            for thee. He has twelve herds on the continent; as many <lb/>
            flocks of sheep, as many herds of swine, and strangers and <lb/>
            herdsmen there feed as many large flocks of goats. And <lb/>
            there they feed large flocks of goats, eleven in all, on the ex­ <lb/>
            treme part of the land ; and excellent men superintend them. <lb/>
            Each of them daily brings home a goat, whichever appears <lb/>
            to be the best of the fatted goats. But I guard and keep <lb/>
            these swine, and having chosen out the best of the swine. I <lb/>
            send it away to them."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but he briskly eat the meat, and greedily <lb/>
            drank the wine, in silence; and he planted (in mind) evils for <lb/>
            the suitors. But when he had supped, and strengthened his <lb/>
            mind with food, having filled the cup from which he himself <lb/>
            drank, he15 gave it to him, full of wine ; but he received it, and <lb/>
            rejoiced in mind, and addressing him spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" O friend, who thus opulent and powerful, as thou sayest, <lb/>
            purchased thee with his possessions ? thou sayest that he <lb/>
            perished for the sake of the honour of Agamemnon. Tell <lb/>
            me, in case by chance I know him, who is such a one. For <lb/>
            Jove perhaps knows this, and the other immortal gods, if <lb/>
            having seen him I could give news of him; for over many <lb/>
            [lands] have I wandered."</p>
          <p>But him the swineherd, chieftain of men, immediately an­ <lb/>
            swered : “ O old man, no man having come after wandering, <lb/>
            bringing news of him, would persuade his wife and beloved <lb/>
            son. But wandering fellows, in want of support, speak false <lb/>
            hoods16 to no purpose, nor do they wish to relate the truth. <lb/>
            But whoever, having wandered, arrives at the people of Ithaea., <lb/>
            he, coming to my mistress, speaks deceitful things. But she, <lb/>
            having received him well, entertains him, and investigates <lb/>

            as is the wont of woman, when her husband perishes else­ <lb/>

            house of my father and mother where I was first born, and <lb/>

            desiring to behold them again with mine eyes, being in my <lb/>
            paternal land ; but regret for absent Ulysses possesses me. I <lb/>
            have awe in naming him,17 O stranger, although not present; <lb/>
            for lie loved me exceedingly, and took care of me in his mind, <lb/>
            but I call him ‘ honoured 18 senior,' although at a distance."</p>
          <p>But him much-enduring divine Ulysses addressed in turn : <lb/>
            " O friend, since thou dost altogether deny it, nor thinkest at <lb/>
            all that he will return, but thy mind is ever incredulous, yet <lb/>
            I will not merely say, but [will say it] with an oath, that <lb/>
            Ulysses returns : but let this be the reward of my good news ; <lb/>
            immediately, when he shall return to his house, [put on me <lb/>
            a cloak and tunic, beautiful garments ;] but before that, I <lb/>
            would not receive them, although very much in want. For <lb/>
            he is hated by me, equally with the gates of hell, who, yield­ <lb/>
            in- to poverty, speaks deceiving words. Now be witness, <lb/>
            Jove, first of the gods, and the hospitable table, and the <lb/>
            hearth of blameless Ulysses, to which I am come; surely <lb/>
            all these things shall be performed, as I relate them: but <lb/>
            Ulysses will return here in this same year; when this month <lb/>
            wanes, and another begins, he will return home, and will be <lb/>
            revenged upon him, whosoever here dishonours his wife and <lb/>

          <p>But him answering thou didst address, O swineherd <lb/>
            Eumæus: " O old man, I shall neither pay this reward for <lb/>
            good news, nor will Ulysses any more return home; but <lb/>
            drink in peace, and let us be mindful of other things besides, <lb/>
            nor put me in mind of these things: for surely my mind in <lb/>

              good king. However we will leave alone the oath ; but may <lb/>
              Ulysses come, as I wish he should, and Penelope, and aged <lb/>
              Laertes, and godlike Telemachus. Now again I lament un­ <lb/>
              ceasingly for the son, whom Ulysses begot, Telemachns : since <lb/>
              the gods had nourished him, like unto a plant; and I said that <lb/>
              he would not be at all inferior amongst men to his dear father, <lb/>
              admirable as to his frame and form ; but some one of the im­ <lb/>
              mortals has injured his mind which was equal within, or some <lb/>
              of men ; but he has gone in quest of news of his father, to <lb/>
              divine Pylos: but for him the illustrious suitors lie in am­ <lb/>
              bush as he is returning home, that the clan of godlike Arce <lb/>
              sias may perish entirely from Ithaca without a name. But <lb/>
              however we will leave him, whether he is wandering or flying <lb/>
              away, and may the son of Saturn hold his hand over him. But <lb/>
              come, do thou, O old man, relate to me thine own sorrows, <lb/>
              and tell me this truly, that I may know it well, who art thou ? <lb/>
              from whence art thou of men ? where are thy city and parents? <lb/>
              in what kind of ship didst thou come ? how did the sailors <lb/>
              conduet thee to Ithaea? whom did they boast themselves to <lb/>
              be ? for I do not think at all that thou earnest here on foot."</p>
          <p>But him mueh-planning Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            Then I will tell thee these things very truly. If now <lb/>
            we had for a long time both food and sweet wine, when we <lb/>
            are within your lodge, to feast at ease, but should others attend <lb/>
            to their business: I should not easily then finish, even for a <lb/>
            whole year, telling of the sorrows of my mind, all the things <lb/>
            whatever I have toiled through by the will of the gods. I <lb/>
            boast myself to be of the race of spacious Crete, the son of an <lb/>
            opulent man : but many other sons also were both nourished <lb/>
            and born in his palace, legitimate from his wife; but me a <lb/>
            purchased mother brought forth, a concubine, but Castor <lb/>
            Hylacides, of whose race I boast myself to be, honoured me <lb/>
            equally with his legitimate sons ; who formerly was honoured, <lb/>
            as a god, by the people amongst the Cretans, on account of <lb/>
            his prosperity, and riches, and his glorious sons. But how­ <lb/>
            ever the fates of death came bringing him to the abodes of <lb/>
            Pluto; and his high-minded sons divided his livelihood, and <lb/>
            cast lots [for the shares] : but to me they gave very few <lb/>
            things, and allotted me a dwelling. But on account of my <lb/>
            excellence I married a wife fit for wealthy men: since I <lb/>
            neither was vain, nor cowardly in war; but now all things <pb n="193"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="231–252,"/> <lb/>
            have failed; however I think that thou wilt know [the ear] <lb/>
            when thou beholdest the straw: 19 for much woe possesses me. <lb/>
            Mars indeed and Minerva bestowed courage on me, and power <lb/>
            to break through ranks, whenever for an ambush I chose <lb/>
            excellent men, sowing evils for mine enemies: nor did my <lb/>
            noble mind ever set death before mine eyes ; but having leaped <lb/>
            on far the foremost with my spear, I slew whoever of hostile <lb/>
            men gave way to me with their feet. Such a one I was in war ; <lb/>
            but work20 was not agreeable to me, nor house-keeping, which <lb/>
            nurtures noble children : but oar-equipped ships were always <lb/>
            loved by me, and wars, and well-polished javelins, and arrows, <lb/>
            mournful things, which are objects of shuddering to others. But <lb/>
            to me these things were dear, these things the deity placed <lb/>
            in my mind; for different men are delighted with different <lb/>
            employments. For before the sons of the Grecians embarked <lb/>
            against Troy, nine times I was commander over men, and <lb/>
            swift ships, against foreign men: and all things turned out <lb/>
            well for me; from these21 I chose out what was agreeable to <lb/>
            my mind, and many things I afterwards obtained by lot; but <lb/>
            my house rapidly increased, and then I became mighty and re­ <lb/>
            vered amongst the Cretans. But when wide-seeing Jove de­ <lb/>
            termined on this hateful expedition, which loosened the knees <lb/>
            of many men, then they ordered me and illustrious Idome­ <lb/>
            neus to take the command of the ships to Troy; nor was there <lb/>
            any contrivance to refuse it, for the clamour of the people <lb/>
            was harsh. There indeed for nine years we sons of the <lb/>
            Grecians waged war, but in the tenth having destroyed <lb/>
            the city of Priam, we embarked homewards with our ships ; <lb/>
            and the deity dispersed the Grecians. But for wretched me <lb/>
            planning Jove devised evil; for for a month only I remained <lb/>
            delighted with my parents, and my virgin-wedded wife, and <lb/>
            my possessions. But then my mind incited me to sail to <lb/>
            Egypt, having well-equipped ships with godlike companions. <lb/>
            I equipped nine ships, and quickly were the people collected <lb/>
            together. For six days then my beloved companions feasted; <lb/>
            but I gave [them] many victims, both to sacrifice to the gods, <lb/>
            and to furnish a banquet for themselves. But on the seventh, <note type="footnote"> 19 i. e. seeing me in my present infirm old age, thou wilt guess what <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="252–290."/> <lb/>
            embarking from spacious Crete, we sailed with a clear, beauti­ <lb/>
            ful north wind, easily, and as if down the stream ; nor indeed <lb/>
            was any one of my ships injured, but we sat unscathed and <lb/>
            free from disease; and the wind and the helmsmen directed <lb/>
            them. But on the fifth day we came to fair-streamed Egypt; <lb/>
            and I stationed my ships, rowed on both sides, in the river <lb/>
            Egyptus ;22 then indeed I ordered my beloved companions <lb/>
            to remain there near to the ships, and to draw up the ships ; <lb/>
            and I urged watches to go to watch-places. But they, yield­ <lb/>
            in- to insolence, following their own impulse, very quickly <lb/>
            laid waste the beautiful fields of the Egyptians, and took <lb/>
            away their wives and infant children, and slew them. And <lb/>
            the clamour soon reached the city; and they, hearing the cry, <lb/>
            came together with the shining morn: and the whole plain <lb/>
            was filled with foot and horse, and the glittering of brass: <lb/>
            but thunder-rejoicing Jove cast a cowardly panic upon my <lb/>
            companions, nor did any one dare to remain opposed to them ;23 <lb/>
            for evils surrounded them24 from on every side. There they <lb/>
            slew many of us indeed with the sharp brass, and some they <lb/>
            led away alive, to work for them by necessity. But Jove <lb/>
            himself put this thought in my breast, (would that I had <lb/>
            died, and drawn on my fate there in Egypt! for calamity <lb/>
            still then awaited me) : I immediately took the well-made hel­ <lb/>
            met from my head, and the shield from my shoulders, and J <lb/>
            threw my spear out of my hand: but I came opposite the <lb/>
            horses of the king, and taking hold of his knees I kissed <lb/>
            them ; but he freed me, and took pity on me: and having set <lb/>
            me in his chariot, he led me home shedding tears. Many of <lb/>
            them indeed rushed against me with their ash-shafted spears.25 <lb/>
            desiring to kill me, (for they were very wroth,) but he warded <lb/>
            them off: for he revered the anger of hospitable Jove, who is <lb/>
            especially indignant at evil deeds. Then indeed I for seven <lb/>
            years remained there, and collected many possessions amongst <lb/>
            Egyptian men, for all offered gifts. But when at length the <lb/>
            eighth year came revolving round, then a Phœnician man <lb/>
            came, knowing deceitful things, crafty, who indeed had <lb/>
            worked many evils for men; who took me away, over-per- <note type="footnote"> 22 The Nile. Cf. Pausan. ix. 40, ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ομηϱος; τοῖς ἀρΧαίοις έΧϱήσατυ</foreign> </note><figure type="illustration">

              suading me by his wit, until we came to Phœnicia, where his <lb/>
              houses and possessions lay. There with him I remained for <lb/>
              a full year. But when the months and days were now finished, <lb/>
              the year revolving round again, and the seasons came on, he set <lb/>
              me in a sea-traversing ship, [ to go] to Libya, having plotted <lb/>
              false things, that I take freight together with him, but in <lb/>
              order that he might transport me thither [to be sold as a slavey, <lb/>
              and receive a vast price [for me]. I attended him in the ship <lb/>
              by necessity, although suspecting. And it ran with a clear <lb/>
              beautiful north wind to the middle main beyond Crete: but <lb/>
              Jove devised destruction for them. But when we had now <lb/>
              left Crete,26 nor did any other land appear, but the heaven and <lb/>
              the sea, then at length the son of Saturn reared an azure cloud <lb/>
              above the hollow ship; and the sea grew dark27 beneath it. <lb/>
              But Jove thundered frequently, and hurled a thunder-bolt upon <lb/>
              the ship: and it was all whirled about, stricken by the thun­ <lb/>
              der-bolt of Jove, and it was filled with sulphur, and all (the <lb/>
              sailors) fell from the ship. And they, like unto gulls, were borne <lb/>
              on the waves around the black ship ; and God took away their <lb/>
              return. But Jove gave to me in mine hands, although having <lb/>
              griefs in mind, the unbroken mast of the azure-prowed ship, <lb/>
              that I might still escape calamity. Clinging around thi?, I <lb/>
              was borne along by the destructive winds: for nine days I <lb/>
              was borne, but in the tenth black night a mighty rolling bil­ <lb/>
              low drifted me to the land of the Thesprotians. There the <lb/>
              hero Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians, entertained me with­ <lb/>
              out expense: for his dear son, coming to me subdued with <lb/>
              cold and toil, led me home, having raised me by the hand, <lb/>
              until he reached the house of his sire. And he put on me a <lb/>
              cloak and tunic as garments.</p>
          <p>" There I heard of Ulysses ; for he said that he entertained <lb/>
            him, and received him kindly, as he was returning to his <lb/>
            paternal land. And he showed me the possessions which <lb/>
            Ulysses had collected together, brass, and gold, and much- <lb/>
            wrought steel. And it would feed another family even to the <lb/>

              of the king. But he said that lie was gone to Dodona, that <lb/>
              he might ask the counsel of the deity from the lofty-tressed <lb/>
              oak of Jove, how he should return to the rich people of <lb/>
              Ithaca, having now been a long time absent, whether openly <lb/>
              or secretly. And he swore to me myself, making libations in <lb/>
              his house, that the ship was launched, and that his companions <lb/>
              were ready, who should at length escort him to his dear pa­ <lb/>
              ternal land. But me he sent away first; for a ship of the <lb/>
              Thesprotians happened to be going to wheat-abounding Du­ <lb/>
              lichium. Then he ordered them to conduct me diligently to <lb/>
              king Acastus: but an evil plan concerning me pleased them <lb/>
              in their mind, that I might still be in woe in addition to ca­ <lb/>
              lamity. But when the sea-traversing ship had sailed far away <lb/>
              from the land, they immediately plotted for me the day of <lb/>
              slavery. They took off my cloak and tunic, my garments, <lb/>
              and then around me threw another sordid rao, and tunic, <lb/>
              tattered, which even thou thyself beholdest with thine eyes. <lb/>
              But in the evening they came to the tilled-lands of Western <lb/>
              Ithaca; there indeed they bound me down in the well- <lb/>
              benched ship, firmly, with a well-twisted cable; but they dis­ <lb/>
              embarking, hastily took a supper near the shore of the sea. <lb/>
              But the gods themselves easily bent back my bond; and <lb/>
              wrapping a rag around my head, I descended down the <lb/>
              polished rudder, and made my breast approach the sea: then <lb/>
              I rowed on with both my hands, swimming, and I was very <lb/>
              quickly out of the way, at a distance from them. Then going <lb/>
              up where there was a thicket of a flourishing wood, I lay <lb/>
              crouching down; but they walked about groaning greatly: <lb/>
              but it did not appear to them to be better to search further; <lb/>
              therefore they embarked again in the hollow ship: but the <lb/>
              gods themselves eaisly concealed me; and leading me away, <lb/>
              made me approach the abode of a skilful man; for still it is <lb/>
              fated for me to live."</p>
          <p>But him thou didst address in answer, O swineherd Eu <lb/>
            mæsus : “ Ah wretched one of strangers ! thou hast excited my <lb/>
            mind very much, relating each of these things, how much <lb/>
            thou hast suffered, and how much thou hast wandered. But <lb/>
            I do not think that these things are right, nor wilt thou per­ <lb/>
            suade me, speaking about Ulysses; why is it fit that thou, <lb/>
            being such a one, shouldst speak falsely, to no purpose ? <lb/>
            But I myself well know as to the return of my master, that <pb n="197"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="366 –405."/> <lb/>
            he was very much hated by all the gods, because they did not <lb/>
            subdue him amongst the Trojans, or in the hands of his <lb/>
            friends, when he had spun out the toil of the war. Then for <lb/>
            him would all the Grecians have made a tomb, and he would <lb/>
            have obtained mighty renown, even for his son hereafter. <lb/>
            But now the Harpies have snatched him away ingloriously. <lb/>
            But I am out of the way amongst the swine ; nor do I go to the <lb/>
            city except by chance prudent Penelope encourages me to come, <lb/>
            when intelligence arrives from any where. But they sitting <lb/>
            near him, inquire every thing, both those who are grieving <lb/>
            for our long absent king, and those who rejoice, consuming <lb/>
            his livelihood with impunity. But to me it is not pleasant to <lb/>
            inquire and ask, from the time since an Ӕtolian man deceived <lb/>
            me by his tale, who indeed having slain a man, having wan­ <lb/>
            dered over much land, came to my abode; and I cherished <lb/>
            him very much. He said that he saw him with Idomeneus <lb/>
            amongst the Cretans, repairing his ships, which the tempests <lb/>
            had shattered: and he said that he would come, either in the <lb/>
            summer or the autumn, bringing many possessions, with his <lb/>
            godlike companions. And do thou, O much-sorrowing old <lb/>
            man, since the deity has brought thee unto me, neither gratify <lb/>
            me at all with falsehoods, nor soothe me at all. For I shall <lb/>
            not on that account reverence or entertain thee, but [as] fear­ <lb/>
            in- hospitable Jove, and pitying thee."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            " Surely thou hast a certain incredulous mind in thy breast, <lb/>
            Thee alone, having made an oath, I have not brought over, <lb/>
            nor do I persuade thee. But come now, we will make a <lb/>
            covenant; but let the gods also, who possess Olympus, be <lb/>
            witnesses unto both [of us]. If thy master shall return to <lb/>
            this house, having put a cloak and tunic as garments upon <lb/>
            me, send me to go to Dulichium, where it is pleasing to my <lb/>
            mind [that I should go] : but if thy master shall not come, as <lb/>
            I tell thee, having charged thy servants, cast me down a great <lb/>
            rock, that another beggar also may avoid to flatter [with false <lb/>
            hopes]."</p>
          <p>But him the divine swineherd answering addressed: “ O <lb/>
            stranger, thus indeed for me there would be glory and ex­ <lb/>
            cellence amongst men, both immediately, and for the future, <lb/>
            if I when I had brought thee into my tent, and bestowed hos­ <lb/>
            pitality on thee, I should afterwards slay thee, and take away <pb n="198"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="406–437"/> <lb/>
            thy dear life, willingly then should I supplicate Jove, the son <lb/>
            of Saturn. But now it is time for supper; very soon will my <lb/>
            companions be within, that we may prepare an abundant sup­ <lb/>
            per in the tent."</p>
          <p>Thus they indeed spoke such words to one another. But <lb/>
            the swine drew near, and the men who feed the swine came: <lb/>
            they fenced them in their accustomed places to sleep ; and an <lb/>
            immense clamour arose from the swine entering their sty. <lb/>
            But he, the divine swineherd, exhorted his companions : <lb/>
            “ Bring the best of the swine, that I may sacrifice it for my <lb/>
            guest from afar; but besides we will ourselves enjoy it, who <lb/>
            have toiled for a long time, suffering on account of the white- <lb/>
            tusked swine ; but others are consuming our labours with im­ <lb/>
            punity."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he cleft wood with the hard steel; <lb/>
            but they brought in a very fat sow of five years old; they <lb/>
            immediately placed it on the hearth ; nor was the swineherd <lb/>
            forgetful of the immortals, (for he possessed an excellent dis­ <lb/>
            position,) but, having offered the first-fruits, he threw the <lb/>
            hair of the head of the white-tusked sow in the fire, and <lb/>
            prayed to all the gods, that wise Ulysses might return to his <lb/>
            home. But he struck it with a splinter of oak, lifting [it] up, <lb/>
            which he left there, having cut it; and life left it: but they <lb/>
            cut up and roasted it; and they quickly singed it; but the <lb/>
            swineherd put the raw parts over the rich fat, taking away on <lb/>
            all sides some flesh for sacrifice28 from the limbs. And he <lb/>
            threw other parts in the fire, having sprinkled them with the <lb/>
            fruit of meal, and they cut up the other parts, and stuck them <lb/>
            on spits, and roasted them skilfully, and drew it all off: 29 and <lb/>
            they threw it all together on the dressers: 30 and the swine­ <lb/>
            herd stood up to carve it (for he understood in his mind <lb/>
            what was right) ; and carving it, he distributed the whole into <lb/>
            seven parts: one part, indeed, having made a vow, he gave <lb/>
            to the Nymphs, and to Mercury, the son of Maia, and the rest <lb/>
            he distributed to each: but he honoured Ulysses with the <lb/>
            continuous back of the white-tusked sow: and he delighted <note type="footnote"> 28 I am indebted to Buttman for this correct explanation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀϱΧόμενος</foreign>. <lb/>

            the mind of the king; and much-planning Ulysses speaking <lb/>
            addressed him: “ Mayest thou be so dear to father Jove as <lb/>
            thou art to me, since thou honourest me, being such a one, <lb/>
            with good things."</p>
          <p>But him thou didst address in answer, O swineherd <lb/>
            Eumræus: "Eat, O divine one of guests, and delight thyself <lb/>
            with these things, such as are present; for God bestows one <lb/>
            thing, and refuses another, whatever he wills in his own <lb/>

          <p>He spoke; and made the first offerings to the immortal <lb/>
            gods: and having made a libation of dark wine, he placed it <lb/>
            in the hands of city-destroying Ulysses, and he sat near his <lb/>
            share. And Mesaulius portioned out bread to them, whom <lb/>
            the swineherd himself alone31 had purchased, when his mas­ <lb/>
            ter was absent, without the knowledge of his mistress and of <lb/>
            old Laertes. But he bought him from the Taphians with his <lb/>
            own possessions. And they stretched out their hands to the <lb/>
            viands lying ready before them: but when they had taken <lb/>
            away the desire of drinking and eating, Mesaulius took away <lb/>
            the food; and they, satiated with bread and flesh, hastened <lb/>
            to bed. But an evil dim-mooned night came on, and Jove <lb/>
            rained all night: and the mighty West wind, that ever brings <lb/>
            rain, blew. And Ulysses addressed them, trying the swine­ <lb/>
            herd, if any how he would take off his cloak and give it to <lb/>
            him, or would urge some one else of his companions to do so: <lb/>
            since he took great care of him :</p>
          <p>“ Hear me now, O Eumæus, and all ye others his com­ <lb/>
            panions, I shall speak some word boasting: for maddening <lb/>
            wine encourages me, which has excited even a very wise man <lb/>
            to sing out loudly, and has set him on to laugh affectedly,32 <lb/>
            and to dance, and has given vent to a word, which was better <lb/>
            unspoken. But since I have first cried out, I will not conceal <lb/>
            it. Would that I were as young, and my strength as firm, as <lb/>
            when we led an ambush under Troy, having contrived it. <lb/>
            But Ulysses and Menelaus, the son of Atreus, led, but with <lb/>
            them I the third ruled: for they desired me. But when in­ <lb/>
            deed we came to the city and the lofty wall, we lay down near <lb/>
            the fortifications amongst the thick bushes, crouching under <lb/>
            our arms amongst the reeds and marsh: but an evil night <note type="footnote"> 31 i. e. with his own money </note><note type="footnote"> 32 Cowper well renders <foreign xml:lang="grc">παλὸν γελάσαι</foreign>, to titter. </note> <pb n="200"/>

            came o , the North wind having fallen, frosty, but above <lb/>
            there was snow, like as hoar-frost, cold, and ice was congealed <lb/>
            around our shields. There all the others had cloaks and gar­ <lb/>
            ments, and they slept quiet, wrapping round their shoulders <lb/>
            with their shields; but I, having set out with my com­ <lb/>
            panions, foolishly left my cloak, since I did not suppose that <lb/>
            it would be excessively cold: but I followed, having a shield <lb/>
            only and a shining girdle. But when it was now the third <lb/>
            part of the night, and the stars had departed, then I ad­ <lb/>
            dressed Ulysses, being near me, nudging him with my elbow <lb/>
            (but lie readily listened): ‘O noble son of Laertes, much. <lb/>
            contriving Ulysses, I shall no longer be amongst the living, <lb/>
            but the weather overcomes me; for I have not a cloak : a <lb/>
            deity deceived me, so that I should only have one garment: <lb/>
            but this can now no longer be avoided.' Thus I spoke, but he <lb/>
            immediately had this plan in his mind, such a one was he to <lb/>
            take counsel, and to fight. And speaking in a low voice, he <lb/>
            thus addressed me: 'Be silent now, for fear some one else of <lb/>
            the Grecians should hear thee.' He spoke, and he held his <lb/>
            head upon his elbow, and spoke: ‘ Hear me, friends, a divine <lb/>
            dream has come upon me in my sleep ; for we have come very <lb/>
            far from the ships : but let some one go to tell Agamemnon, <lb/>
            son of Atreus, the shepherd of the people, in order that he <lb/>
            may incite more [men] to come from the ships.' Thus he <lb/>
            spoke, but Thoas, son of Andræmon, quickly arose, and he <lb/>
            threw off his purple cloak, and set out to run to the ships ; <lb/>
            but I lay in his garment gladly ; and golden-throned Morning <lb/>
            shone. Would that I were now thus young, and my strength <lb/>
            was firm, then some one of the swineherds in the stalls would <lb/>
            give me a cloak, on both accounts, through love and through <lb/>
            reverence of such a man : but now they disregard me, having <lb/>
            evil garments on my body."</p>
          <p>But him thou didst address in answer, O swineherd Eu­ <lb/>
            mæus: " O old man, the story is blameless for thee, as to <lb/>
            what thou hast related, nor hast thou spoken any profitless <lb/>
            word contrary to what is right. Therefore thou shalt not now <lb/>
            be in want of a garment, nor of any thing else of the things that <lb/>
            are needful for a suppliant who has undergone much, and en­ <lb/>
            treats one; but in the morning thou shalt shake thine own rags <lb/>
            about thee. For there are not many cloaks and change of <lb/>
            garments here to put on, but one only for each man. [But <pb n="201"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="516—533. xv. 1—7."/> <lb/>
            when the dear son of Ulysses returns, he himself will give <lb/>
            thee a cloak and tunic as garments, and will send thee wher­ <lb/>
            ever thy heart and mind commands thee."]</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken he leaped up; and he placed a bed for <lb/>
            him near the fire, and on it he threw skins of sheep and goats. <lb/>
            Then Ulysses lay down ; and he spread over him a thick and <lb/>
            large cloak, which afforded him a change, to put on, when <lb/>
            any terrible storm arose.</p>
          <p>Thus then Ulysses slept there, and the young men slept <lb/>
            near him, but a bed there did not please the swineherd, to <lb/>
            sleep away from the swine : and going out, he armed himself; <lb/>
            and Ulysses rejoiced, because indeed he took care of his pro­ <lb/>
            perty when he was at a distance. First then he girt a sharp <lb/>
            sword around his sturdy shoulders, and put on a very thick <lb/>
            garment, to ward off the wind, and he took the fleece of a <lb/>
            large, well-nourished goat, and he took a sharp javelin, for a <lb/>
            warder off of dogs and men. And he set out to lie down <lb/>
            where the white-tusked swine slept under a hollow rock, under <lb/>
            shelter from the North wind.</p>

          <p>Telemachus, whilst staying at Lacedæmon with Pisistratus, son of Nestor, is <lb/>
            admonished by Minerva in a dream, and sets out for Ithaca. After a brief <lb/>
            stay at Pheræ, he reaches Pylos, when, just as he is on the point of em­ <lb/>
            barking, Theoclymenus, an Argive prophet, entreats him to take him on <lb/>
            board, as he was a fugitive, having committed murder. Meanwhile Eu­ <lb/>
            mæus relates to Ulysses how he reached Ithaca. Telemachus arrives at <lb/>
            Ithaca, commands his companions to take the ship to the city, commits <lb/>
            Theoclymenus to the care of one of them, and himself goes to Eumæus.</p>
          <p>BUT Pallas Minerva went to wide1 Lacedæ*mon, to put the <lb/>
            glorious son of magnanimous Ulysses in mind of his return, <lb/>
            and to incite him to go back. And she found Telemachus and <lb/>
            the glorious son of Nestor sleeping in the vestibule of renown­ <lb/>
            ed Menelaus : the son of Nestor indeed [she found] overcome <lb/>
            with soft sleep; but sweet sleep did not possess Telemachus, <lb/>
            but in his mind he raised up cares for his father throughout <note type="footnote"> I See Loewe on vi. 4. </note> <lb/>

            the ambrosial night: and blue-eyed. Minerva standing near <lb/>
            addressed [him]:</p>
          <p>" O Telemachus, no longer to advantage art thou wander­ <lb/>
            ing a long time from thine home, leaving both thy possessions, <lb/>
            and men so overbearing in thine house: lest they, having <lb/>
            made a division, should consume2 all thy possessions, and thou <lb/>
            shouldst have come a vain journey. But as quickly as pos­ <lb/>
            sible exhort Menelaus, gallant in battle, to send thee, that thou <lb/>
            mayest still find thy blameless mother at home ; (for now her <lb/>
            father and brothers encourage her to marry Eurymachus; <lb/>
            for he surpasses all the suitors in gifts, and has increased the <lb/>
            bridal presents ;) for fear some property should be taken away <lb/>
            from thine house against thy will. For thou knowest what is <lb/>
            the mind in the breast of a woman; she wishes to increase <lb/>
            the house of that man, whoever weds her, but she no longer <lb/>
            is mindful of her former children and virgin-wedded3 hus­ <lb/>
            band, who is dead, nor does she inquire for him. But do thou <lb/>
            thyself go and commit every thing to [one] of the servants, <lb/>
            whoever appears to thee to be the best, until the gods show <lb/>
            thee a good wife. But I indeed will tell thee something else ; <lb/>
            and do thou set it in thy mind. The chiefs of the suitors <lb/>
            carefully lie in ambush for thee in the strait of Ithaca and <lb/>
            rugged Samos, longing to slay thee, before thou dost reach thy <lb/>
            paternal land. But I do not think these things [will happen] ; <lb/>
            the earth will first hold some one of the suitors, who are <lb/>
            consuming thy livelihood. But keep thy well-built ship far <lb/>
            away from the island, and sail, nevertheless, in the night; <lb/>
            and [one] of the immortals will send thee a prosperous <lb/>
            gale from behind, whoever guards and preserves thee. But <lb/>
            when thou shalt reach the first shore of Ithaci, hasten thy <lb/>
            ship and all thy companions to the city ; and do thou first go <lb/>
            to the swineherd, who is the guardian of thy swine; but, ne­ <lb/>
            vertheless, he has a kind disposition. And sleep there during <lb/>
            the night; and urge him [to go] within the city to give a <lb/>
            message to prudent Penelope, that thou art safe, and hast ar­ <lb/>
            rived from Pylos."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, she departed to lofty Olympus. But <lb/>
            he roused the son of Nestor from sweet sleep [moving him <lb/>
            with his heel, and addressed him in words]: “ Rise, O Pisis' <note type="footnote"> 2 Cf. xiv. 2'23, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκωφελἱη</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> ' Or rather, " true, legitimate." See P itm. Lexil. p. 393. </note> <pb n="203"/>

            tratus, son of Nestor, leading the solid-hoofed steeds, yoke <lb/>
            them under the chariot, that we may perform our journey."</p>
          <p>But him Pisistratus, the son of Nestor, answered in turn : <lb/>
            " O Telemachus, it is not possible for us, although hastening <lb/>
            on our journey, to drive through the gloomy night: but it <lb/>
            will soon be morning. But remain, until the spear-renowned <lb/>
            hero Atrides, Menelaus, bringing presents, shall place them <lb/>
            in our chariot, and addressing us with kindly words, shall <lb/>
            send us away. For a guest all his days is mindful of that <lb/>
            hospitable man who affords entertainment."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and immediately the golden-throned morn­ <lb/>
            ing came; and Menelaus, gallant in battle, came near them, <lb/>
            rising from his bed, from fair-haired Helen. But when the <lb/>
            dear son of Ulysses perceived him, the hero hastening put a <lb/>
            shining tunic about his body, and threw a large robe over his <lb/>
            sturdy shoulders: and he went out of the door, and Telema­ <lb/>
            chus, the dear son of divine Ulysses, standing near addressed <lb/>
            him: “ O Menelaus, Jove-nurtured son of Atreus, chieftain <lb/>
            of the people, now then send me away to my dear paternal <lb/>
            land; for now my mind desires to reach home."</p>
          <p>But him Menelaus, gallant in battle, answered: "0 Te­ <lb/>
            lemachus, I will not detain thee here for much time, since <lb/>
            thou art anxious for thy return : I should also be indignant at <lb/>
            any other man who receives guests, who should love one very <lb/>
            much, or hate one very much ; but all things that are proper <lb/>
            are best. He is an equal evil, both he who urges a guest who <lb/>
            is not willing to return, and he who detains one hastening [to <lb/>
            depart]. [It is fit to receive a guest kindly when present, <lb/>
            and to send him away willingly.4] But remain, until I bring <lb/>
            beautiful gifts and place them on the chariot, and thou mayest <lb/>
            behold them with thine eyes; and I will tell the women to <lb/>
            prepare a banquet in the palace, enough of the things that are <lb/>
            within. It is both a glory, and honour, and an advantage, <lb/>
            [for men] to set out over a long, boundless tract, having <lb/>
            feasted. But if thou dost wish to turn your course through <lb/>
            Hellas, and the middle of Argos, then I will myself attend <lb/>
            thee, and will yoke my horses, and will show thee the cities <lb/>
            of men; nor will any one send us away in vain, but will give <figure type="illustration">

              us some one thing at least to carry away, either some one of <lb/>
              brazen tripods, or cauldrons, or two mules, or a golden cup."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : O Mene­ <lb/>
            laus, Jove-nurtured son of Atreus, chieftain of the people, I <lb/>
            would rather5 now return to my own home: (for on setting <lb/>
            out I did not leave behind a guard over my possessions,) <lb/>
            lest seeking for my godlike sire, I myself should perish, or <lb/>
            some excellent treasure should be lost to me from the palace."</p>
          <p>But when Menelaus, gallant in battle, heard this, he imme­ <lb/>
            diately commanded his wife and maid-servants to prepare a <lb/>
            feast in the palace, enough of the things that were within. <lb/>
            And Eteoneus, son of Boëtheus, came near him, rising from <lb/>
            his bed, since he did not dwell far off from him: him, Mene­ <lb/>
            laus, gallant in battle, ordered to light a fire, and to roast <lb/>
            meat: and he, having heard, did not disobey him. But he <lb/>
            himself descended to his fragrant chamber, not alone, [for] <lb/>
            Helen and Megapenthes went with him. But when they <lb/>
            came there, where lay his treasures, the son of Atreus then <lb/>
            took a round cup, and ordered his son Megapenthes to carry <lb/>
            a silver bowl; and Helen stood near the chests, where were <lb/>
            her all-variegated garments, which she herself wrought. He­ <lb/>
            len, divine one of women, having taken one of these, brought <lb/>
            it, which was the most beautiful in its embroidery and the <lb/>
            largest: and it shone like a star, and lay lowest of all. And <lb/>
            they set out to go onward through the house, until they came <lb/>
            to Telemachus; but him auburn-haired Menelaus [thus] <lb/>
            addressed:</p>
          <p>" O Telemachus, may Jove, the loud-sounding husband of <lb/>
            Juno, so accomplish thy return, as thou desirest in thy mind.. <lb/>
            But of the presents, whatever treasures lie in my house, I will <lb/>
            give thee that which is most beautiful and precious. I will <lb/>
            give thee a wrought bowl: but it is all silver, and the lips are <lb/>
            bound with gold; it is the work of Vulcan : but the hero <lb/>
            Phædimns, king of the Sidonians, gave it [to me], when his <lb/>
            house sheltered me, as I was returning from thence; but I <lb/>
            wish to give this to thee."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, the hero Atrides placed the round cup <lb/>
            in his hands; but strong Megapenthes bringing the shining <lb/>
            silver bowl, placed it before him: and fair-cheeked Helen <note type="footnote"> Cf. Buttm. Lexil. p. 195. </note> <pb n="205"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="124–159."/> <lb/>
            stood near him, having a garment in her hands, and spoke and <lb/>
            said:</p>
          <p>" I also give thee this gift, dear child, a memorial of the <lb/>
            hands of Helen, against the time of thy most desirable mar­ <lb/>
            riage, for thy wife to wear: but in the mean time let it lie in <lb/>
            thy palace, near thy dear mother; and mayest thou rejoicing <lb/>
            reach thy well-built house, and thy paternal land."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, she placed it in his hands ; but he <lb/>
            received it rejoicing. And the hero Pisistratus having re­ <lb/>
            ceived them, placed them in the basket,6 and regarded all <lb/>
            things in his mind. But auburn-haired Menelaus led them <lb/>
            to the house ; and they then sat down on the benches and <lb/>
            thrones. And the handmaiden bringing water in a beautiful <lb/>
            golden ewer, poured it over a silver cauldron to wash in; and <lb/>
            near them she spread a polished table. And the venerable <lb/>
            housekeeper bringing food, set it near them [putting many <lb/>
            dainties on it, gratifying them as well as she could from the <lb/>
            things at hand]. And near [them] the son of Boëthus di­ <lb/>
            vided the meat, and distributed the shares, and the son of <lb/>
            glorious Menelaus poured out wine: and they stretched out <lb/>
            their hands to the food that was lying ready before them. <lb/>
            But when they had taken away the desire of drinking and <lb/>
            eating, then Telemachus and the illustrious son of Nestor <lb/>
            yoked the horses, and mounted the variegated chariot: and <lb/>
            they drove out of the vestibule and resounding portico. And <lb/>
            auburn-haired Menelaus, son of Atreus, went after them, <lb/>
            having sweet wine in his right hand, in a golden cup, that <lb/>
            they might go, having made a libation. And he stood before <lb/>
            the horses; and pledging them, he spoke:</p>
          <p>Farewell, O youths, and bid Nestor the shepherd of the <lb/>
            people [hail], for to me he was mild as a father, as long as <lb/>
            we sons of the Grecians waged war in Troy."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn: “ And by <lb/>
            all means, O thou nurtured of Jove, as thou desirest, when we <lb/>
            arrive we will relate all these things to him ; so may I, hav­ <lb/>
            in- returned, reaching Ithaca, tell Ulysses in his house how <lb/>
            I come, hating met with all kindness from thee, and I bring <lb/>
            many and excellent treasures."</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>As lie was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand, an <lb/>
            eagle, bearing a large white goose in its talons, tame, from the <lb/>
            court: and men and women followed shouting : and it, coming <lb/>
            near to them, rushed on their right hand before the horses, <lb/>
            and they beholding it rejoiced, and the mind of all was de­ <lb/>
            lighted in their breasts. But to them Pisistratus, son of Nes­ <lb/>
            tor, began the discourse: " Now tell me, O Jove-nurtured <lb/>
            Menelaus, chieftain of the people, if God has shown this as a <lb/>
            sign to us, or to thee thyself."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke: but Mars-beloved Menelaus meditated, <lb/>
            reflecting in what way he should answer him rightly. But <lb/>
            long-robed Helen spoke, anticipating him: " Listen to me, <lb/>
            and I will prophesy, as the immortals put it in my mind, and <lb/>
            as I think it will be accomplished. As this [eagle] coming <lb/>
            from the mountain, where is its race and birth, snatched away <lb/>
            the goose, which had been nurtured delicately in the house ; <lb/>
            so Ulysses, having suffered many ills, and having wandered <lb/>
            much, will return home and be revenged; or is already at <lb/>
            home, and devises evil for all the suitors."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Telemachus answered in turn: “ May <lb/>
            Jove, the loud-sounding husband of Juno, so bring it to pass, <lb/>
            then would I, even there, make vows to thee, as to a god."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and threw the scourge upon the horses: and they <lb/>
            very quickly rushed to the plain from the city, eager. And <lb/>
            they all the day, having the yoke around [their necks], shook <lb/>
            it: and the sun set, and all the ways were overshadowed. <lb/>
            And they came to Pheræ, to the house of Diodes, son of Orsi­ <lb/>
            lochus, whom Alphëus begot as his son. And there they <lb/>
            slept during the night; and he set before them hospitable <lb/>
            gifts. But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, <lb/>
            appeared, they yoked the horses, and mounted the variegated <lb/>
            chariot: and they drove out of the vestibule and resounding <lb/>
            portico. And he scourged them that they should go on ; and <lb/>
            they not unwilling flew. And they quickly came to the lofty <lb/>
            citadel of Pylos: and then Telemachus addressed the son of <lb/>
            Nestor:</p>
          <p>“ O son of Nestor, how, having promised what I ask, <lb/>
            wouldst thou perform it ? throughout we profess ourselves to <lb/>
            be acquaintances from the friendship of our fathers; but we <lb/>
            are also of equal age; and this journey will more tonfirm us <lb/>
            in unity of mind. Do not take me beyond out of the way of <pb n="207"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="200 –230"/> <lb/>
            the ship, but leave me here, lest the old man should detain me <lb/>
            against my will in his house, longing to entertain me : but it <lb/>
            is necessary for me to return immediately."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but the son of Nestor considered in his <lb/>
            mind, how, having made a promise to him, he might perform <lb/>
            it rightly. And thus to him considering it seemed to be <lb/>
            better ; he turned the horses to the swift ship and the shore <lb/>
            of the sea; and he took out land placed in] the stern of the <lb/>
            ship the beautiful presents, the garment and gold, which Me­ <lb/>
            nelaus gave him; and urging him, he spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>“In haste now embark, and order all thy companions, be­ <lb/>
            fore I reach home, and inform the old man. For I know this <lb/>
            well in my breast and in my mind, how violent is his temper, <lb/>
            nor will he let thee go: but he will himself come here to call <lb/>
            thee: nor do I think that thou wilt go away empty; for he <lb/>
            will be very wrath."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he drove the beautiful-haired horses <lb/>
            back to the city of the Pylians, and quickly reached the dwell­ <lb/>
            in-. And Telemachus commanded his companions, urging <lb/>
            them on: " Put in order the tackle, my companions, in the <lb/>
            black ship; and let us ourselves embark, that we may perform <lb/>
            our voyage."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and they heard him well, and obeyed. And <lb/>
            they quickly embarked and sat down upon the benches. He <lb/>
            indeed was toiling thus, and praying, and he sacrificed to <lb/>
            Minerva near the stern of the ship ; and a foreigner came <lb/>
            near him, flying from Argos, a prophet, having slain a man :7 <lb/>
            but he was a descendant of the race of Melampus, who for­ <lb/>
            merly dwelt in Pylos, the mother of sheep, opulent, inhabiting <lb/>
            a very excellent house amongst the Pylians: then indeed he <lb/>
            came to another people, flying his country, and magnanimous <lb/>
            Neleus, most illustrious of the living, who kept his great pos­ <lb/>

            Eumenides, § 44, p. 129, &amp;c. He remarks that "in the Heroic age the <lb/>
            punishment for homicide was on the whole more severe than in the Attic <lb/>
            courts and Platonic scheme of laws. For," as he observes in reference <lb/>
            to the present passage of Homer, " the pursuit of vengeance was carried <lb/>
            beyond the frontiers ; neither was it limited in its operation as by Attic <lb/>
            law, but was exercised in all its relentlessness; even in foreign countries <lb/>
            the fugitive murderer was in constant apprehension of the avenger." </note> <pb n="208"/>

            was bound in the palace of Phylacus8 in a difficult bond, suf. <lb/>
            fering violent griefs, on account of the daughter of Neleus, <lb/>
            and a hoavy calamity, which the goddess, dreadful to be ap­ <lb/>
            proached,9 the Fury, placed in his mind. But he escaped <lb/>
            death, and drove the loud-lowing beeves to Pylos from Phy­ <lb/>
            lace, and took revenge on godlike Neleus, for his shameful <lb/>
            conduct, and brought home a wife for his brother. And he <lb/>
            came to another people, to horse-pasturing Argos; for there <lb/>
            it was fated for him to dwell, ruling over many Argives. <lb/>
            There he married a wife, and built a lofty-roofed house, and <lb/>
            begot Antiphates and Mantius, brave sons. Antiphates begot <lb/>
            magnanimous Oileus: but Oileus begot people-stirring Am <lb/>
            phiaraus, whom Ӕgis-bearing Jove and Apollo loved exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly in their heart, in every kind of friendship; but he did <lb/>
            not reach the threshold of old age, but perished in Thebes, <lb/>
            on account of woman's presents.10 His sons were Alemæon <lb/>
            and Amphiloehus. Mantius besides begot Polyphides and <lb/>
            Clytus: but golden-throned Aurora snatched away Clytus, <lb/>
            on account of his beauty, that he might live amongst the <lb/>
            immortals. But Apollo made noble-minded Polyhides a <lb/>
            prophet, far the most excellent of mortals, (when Amphiaraus <lb/>
            had died,) who ruled over Hyperesia, enraged with his father; <lb/>
            there he dwelling prophesied to all mortals. His son ap­ <lb/>
            proached, but Theoclymenus was his name, who then stood <lb/>
            near Telemachus; and he found him making a libation and <lb/>
            praying near the swift black ship; and addressing him, he <lb/>
            spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" O friend, since I find thee sacrificing in this place, I en­ <lb/>

            possessions. Melampus attempted the service, failed, and was cast into <lb/>

            thou? from whence art thou amongst men? Where are thy <lb/>
            city, and thy parents?"</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " There­ <lb/>
            fore I will tell thee very accurately, O stranger. I am from <lb/>
            Ithaca by race, and my father is Ulysses, if he ever was <lb/>
            alive:11 bat now he has perished by a miserable death. <lb/>

            come to inquire after my long-absent sire."</p>
          <p>But him godlike Theoclymenus addressed in turn : " So <lb/>
            also am I indeed away from my country, having slain a kin­ <lb/>
            dred man: but he had many brothers and friends in horse- <lb/>
            pasturing Argos, and the Grecians have great power. Avoid­ <lb/>
            ing death and black fate at their hands, I fly; since it is now <lb/>
            destiny for me to wander amongst men. But put me on board <lb/>
            thy ship, since flying I have besought thee, lest they should <lb/>
            slay me : for I think that they are pursuing."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " I will <lb/>
            not certainly reject thee from my equal ship, if thou art de­ <lb/>
            sirous [of going] : but follow, and there thou shalt be enter­ <lb/>
            tained with such things as we have."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he received from him his brazen spear, <lb/>
            and extended it on the deck of the ship rowed on both sides: <lb/>
            and he himself embarked in the sea-traversing ship. And <lb/>
            then he sat down in the stern ; and he seated Theoclymenus <lb/>
            near himself: and they (the sailors) loosed the halsers. And <lb/>
            Telemachus exhorting his companions, bade them make ready <lb/>
            the tackle; and they eagerly obeyed. And raising the pine <lb/>
            mast, they placed it within the hollow mast hole, and bound <lb/>
            it down with cables ; and they hoisted the white sails with <lb/>
            well-twisted bull-hides. And to them blue-eyed Minerva sent <lb/>
            a favourable gale, blowing sharply upon them through the <lb/>
            air, that the ship running along might very quickly make its <lb/>
            way over the briny water of the sea. [And they came to <lb/>
            Crouni, and to fair-streamed Chalois.]12 But the sun set. and <lb/>
            all the ways were overshadowed. And it reached Pheræ,13 <lb/>

            where the Epeans rule. From thence he sent it on to the <lb/>
            swift14 islands, meditating whether he should escape death or <lb/>
            be taken.</p>
          <p>In the mean time Ulysses and the divine swineherd were <lb/>
            feasting in the tent: and near them the other men feasted. <lb/>
            But when they had taken away the desire of eating and drink­ <lb/>
            ing, Ulysses addressed them, trying the swineherd, whether <lb/>
            he would still kindly entertain him, and desire him to remain <lb/>
            there in the stall, or would incite him to go to the city:</p>
          <p>" Hear me now, O Eumæns, and ye all the rest of his com­ <lb/>
            panions, at dawn I desire to go to the city, in order to beg, <lb/>
            that I may not waste away thee and thy companions. But <lb/>
            suggest to me well, and also give me a good guide, who in­ <lb/>
            deed may lead me thither: but I myself will wander through <lb/>
            the city by necessity, [to see] if any one will give me a small <lb/>
            measure of wine, and a meal-cake. And coming to the house of <lb/>
            divine Ulysses, I would fain tell the news to prudent Penelope: <lb/>
            and I would be mixed with the overbearing suitors, [to see] <lb/>
            if they will give me a meal, since they have countless dainties. <lb/>
            Quickly would I well perform amongst them, whatever they <lb/>
            wished. For I will tell thee, but do thou understand and listen <lb/>
            to me, by the will of the messenger Mercury, who indeed <lb/>
            awards grace and renown to the works of all men, in serving <lb/>
            no other mortal would contend with me, both to keep up a <lb/>
            fire well, and to cleave dry faggots, and to carve, and roast, <lb/>
            and pour out wine, such things as inferiors are wont to do <lb/>
            for the good."</p>
          <p>But him thou, O swineherd Eumæus, didst address in great <lb/>
            sorrow : " All me ! stranger, why has this thought been in thy <lb/>
            mind ? certainly thou altogether desirest to perish there, if thou <lb/>
            art willing to enter the crowd of suitors, whose insolence and <lb/>

            and calamity and grief come. But now, since thou detained <lb/>
            me, and commandest me to wait for him, come, tell me about <lb/>
            the mother of divine Ulysses, and his sire, whom when he set <lb/>
            out lie left upon the threshold of old age, if they are by <lb/>
            chance still aliNe under the beams of the sun, or are now <lb/>
            dead, and in the houses of Pluto."</p>
          <p>But him the swineherd, chief of men, addressed in turn : <lb/>
            " Therefore I will tell thee very truly, O stranger: Laertes is <lb/>
            still alive, but is for ever praying to Jove, that his life may <lb/>
            perish from his limbs in his own palace: for lie is violently <lb/>
            grieved for his absent son, and his skilful virgin wife, who <lb/>
            most of all grieved him when she died, and placed him in <lb/>
            an immature old age. But she, through sorrow for her re­ <lb/>
            nowned son, perished by a miserable death ;15 so may not any <lb/>
            one die, whoever dwelling here is a friend to me, and does <lb/>
            friendly acts. Whilst indeed then she was alive, although <lb/>
            grieving, so long was it dear to me to inquire and ask her, <lb/>
            because she herself nurtured me with long-robed Ctimena, <lb/>
            her illustrious daughter, whom she bore youngest of her chil­ <lb/>
            dren : with her I was brought up, and she honoured me but <lb/>
            little less. But when we both reached much desirable youth, <lb/>
            they immediately sent her to Samos, and received large <lb/>
            [dowries]. But me she sent to the country, having clad me <lb/>
            with a cloak and tunic, very beautiful garments, and having <lb/>
            given me sandals for my feet; but she loved me in her heart <lb/>
            still more. But now I am in want of these things ; yet the <lb/>
            blessed gods increase for me the work, in which I abide ; from <lb/>
            these things I have eaten and drunk, and have given to <lb/>
            objects of pity.16 But from my mistress I cannot hear any <note type="footnote"> 15 She either died of a broken heart, or hung herself. See Eustathius. </note><note type="footnote"> 16 Venerable, because objects of a regard almost, amounting to super­ <lb/>

            the servants greatly desire to speak before their mistress, and <lb/>
            to inquire every thing: and to cat and drink: and then to <lb/>
            carry something into the country, such things as ever delight <lb/>
            the mind of servants."</p>
          <p>But him much-counselling Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            " Alas ! how when thou wast little, O swineherd Eumœus, <lb/>
            didst thou wander far from thy country and parents. But <lb/>
            come, tell me this, and relate it truly, whether was the wide- <lb/>
            wayed city of men plundered, in which thy father and vener­ <lb/>
            able mother dwelt; or did hostile men take thee in ships, <lb/>
            when left alone with sheep or oxen, and transport thee to the <lb/>
            house of this man, and did he give a fit price [for thee] ?"</p>
          <p>But him the swineherd, chief of men, addressed in turn : <lb/>
            " O stranger, since thou askest of me and inquirest these <lb/>
            things, now attend in silence, and delight thyself, and sitting <lb/>
            down, quaff wine; but these nights are exceedingly long; <lb/>
            it is in our power to sleep, and it is in our power to listen <lb/>
            delighted: nor is it fit that thou shouldst go to rest before <lb/>
            the time : even much sleep is a pain. But whomsoever of the <lb/>
            others his heart and mind commands, let him sleep, having <lb/>
            gone away: but together with the shining morn having made <lb/>
            his meal, let him attend upon my master's swine. But let us <lb/>
            drinking and feasting in the tent, be delighted, recalling <lb/>
            to mind the grievous cares of one another : for after a <lb/>
            time a man is delighted even with griefs, whosoever has <lb/>
            suffered very many things and has wandered much. But <lb/>
            I will tell thee this which thou askest and inquirest of me. <lb/>
            There is a certain island called Syria (if thou by chance hast <lb/>
            heard of it) beyond Ortygia, where are the dials18 of the sun. <lb/>
            It is not so very large ; but it is excellent, fit for pasture, <lb/>
            rich in sheep, full of wine, abounding in wheat; and hunger <lb/>
            never comes upon the people, nor is there any other hateful <lb/>
            disease upon wretched mortals; but when the tribes of men <lb/>
            grow old in the city, silver-bowed Apollo, coming with Diana, <lb/>

            father Ctesius Ormenides, like unto the immortal,,;, reigned <lb/>
            over both of them.</p>
          <p>But there Phœnicians came, men illustrious by sea. cunning <lb/>
            fellows bringing numberless trinkets in their black ship.19 Now <lb/>
            there was a Phœnician woman in the house of mv sire, beauti­ <lb/>
            ful, and large, and skilled in illustrious weaving works. Her <lb/>
            then the crafty Phoeniciam seduced; some one first mingled <lb/>
            with her as she was washing, near the hollow ship, in the couch <lb/>
            and in love ; which things seduce the minds of women, although <lb/>
            one should happen to be a good work-woman. Then indeed he <lb/>
            asked her, who she was, and whence she came: and she imme­ <lb/>
            diately mentioned the lofty-roofed house of her father: 'I <lb/>
            boast to be from brass-abounding Sidon, and I am the daughter <lb/>
            of with wealth flowing Arybas ; but the Taphians, men given to <lb/>
            robbery, snatched me away as I was returning from the fields ; <lb/>
            and taking me away, they transported me for sale to the house of <lb/>
            this man ; but he gave a fit price [for me].' But her the man, <lb/>
            who mingled with her secretly, again addressed : ' Wouldst <lb/>
            thou now again come home together with us, that thou mayest <lb/>
            behold the lofty-roofed house of thy father and mother, and <lb/>
            them too themselves? for they are still alive, and are called <lb/>
            opulent.' But him the woman again addressed and answered <lb/>
            in discourse. ' This might be, if ye at least were willing, O <lb/>
            sailors, to be pledged with an oath, that ye will take me home <lb/>
            unharmed.' Thus she spoke, but they all swore as she com­ <lb/>
            manded. But when they had sworn and completed the oath, <lb/>
            the woman again addressed and answered them in discourse : <lb/>
            ' Now be silent; let not any one of your companions speak to <lb/>
            me with words, when he meets me, either in the road, or by <lb/>
            chance at the fountain; for fear some one coming to the house, <lb/>
            should tell the old man: but he, suspecting me, should bind <lb/>
            me with a difficult bond, and should plan destruction for yon. <lb/>
            But keep your words in your breast, and hasten the purchase <lb/>
            of provisions. But when indeed the ship is now full of means <lb/>
            of livelihood, then let a message come quickly to me to the <lb/>
            house ; for I will bring both gold, whatever comes under my <lb/>
            hand, and I would also willingly give other things, as payment <lb/>
            for my passage: for I nurse the son of the excellent man in <note type="footnote"> It Cf Herodot. i. 2, where he gives a similar account respecting Io. </note> <pb n="214"/>

            the palace, a very cunning child, that can run with one out <lb/>
            of doors; him I would take on board ship; and he would gain <lb/>
            a large price for you, wheresoever ye may transport him [for <lb/>
            sale] to foreign men.</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, she departed to the beautiful house: <lb/>
            but they, remaining there amongst us for a whole year, pur­ <lb/>
            chased much substance in their hollow ship : but when the <lb/>
            hollow ship was now laden20 for them to return, then they <lb/>
            sent a messenger, to tell the woman ; a very skilful man came <lb/>
            to the house of my sire, having a golden necklace, and it was <lb/>
            set in amber: the handmaidens and my venerable mother <lb/>
            turned it round and round with their hands in the palace, and <lb/>
            beheld it with their eyes ; promising a price [for it] : but he <lb/>
            made the sign to her in silence. He however, having made <lb/>
            the sign, went to the hollow ship; but she, laying hold of me <lb/>
            by the hand, led me out of doors from the house: and she <lb/>
            found in the portico both the cups, and the tables of the men <lb/>
            who had been feasting, who attended upon my sire: they in­ <lb/>
            deed had gone out to the session, and to the assembly of the <lb/>
            people : and she quickly concealing three bowls under her bo­ <lb/>
            som, carried them out; and I followed through my thought- <lb/>
            lessness ; and the sun set, and at the ways were overshadowed. <lb/>
            And we going swiftly reached the renowned haven ; there was <lb/>
            the fast-sailing ship of the Phœnicians. They then embarking <lb/>
            sailed over the moist ways, having put us on board ; and Jove <lb/>
            sent a favourable gale. For six days we continually sailed <lb/>
            both nights and day; but when Jove, the son of Saturn, <lb/>
            brought on the seventh day, then shaft-rejoicing Diana struck <lb/>
            the woman ; and she resounded as she fell in the hold, like a <lb/>
            sea gull: and they threw her out to become a prey to sea- <lb/>
            calves, and fishes; but I was left sorrowing at heart. And <lb/>
            the wind and the water carrying them along made them ap­ <lb/>
            proach Ithaca; there Laertes purchased me with his posses­ <lb/>
            sions. Thus I beheld this land with my eyes.'"</p>
          <p>But him Jove-born Ulysses answered in discourse: " O <lb/>
            Eumæus, very much hast thou moved my mind in my breast, <lb/>
            relating each of these things, how many griefs thou hast stir­ <lb/>
            fertd in thy mind. But however Jove has given good unto <lb/>
            thee even with misfortune, since having toiled much thou hast <lb/>
            come to the house of a mild man. who liberally affords thee <note type="footnote"> 20 See Buttmann, Lexil. p. 465. </note> <pb n="215"/>

            moat and drink; and thou livest a good life : but I come here, <lb/>
            having wandered over many cities of mortals."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke to one another; but they slept for no <lb/>
            long time, but for a very little white ; for beautiful-throned <lb/>
            Morn soon came. But upon the shore the companions of <lb/>
            Telemachus loosed the sails, and quickly took down the mast, <lb/>
            and drew it on to the port with their oars. And they threw <lb/>
            out the anchors, and bound down the halsers. And they <lb/>
            hemselves went out upon the beach of the sea, and got ready <lb/>
            a meal, and mixed the dark wine. But when they had taken <lb/>
            away the desire of drinking and eating, to them prudent <lb/>
            Telemaehus began discourse:</p>
          <p>" Do ye indeed now drive the black ship to the city, but I <lb/>
            will go to the country and to [my] shepherds ; but in the even­ <lb/>
            ing, having seen my fields, I will go to the city: and in the <lb/>
            morning I will give you wages for your journey, an excellent <lb/>
            feast of flesh and sweet-drinking wine."</p>
          <p>But him godlike Theoclymenus addressed in turn : "Where <lb/>
            shall I go, my dear son ? to the house of whom of the men, <lb/>
            who rule over rugged Ithaca, shall I come ? Should I go <lb/>
            direct to thy mother's and thine house?"</p>
          <p>And him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " Other­ <lb/>
            wise I should desire thee to go to our house ; for there would <lb/>
            be no lacking of hospitable entertainment; but it is worse for <lb/>
            thee [to do so] : since I shall be absent, nor will my mother <lb/>
            see thee ; for she does not by any means appear frequently to <lb/>
            the suitors in the house, but away from them weaves a web <lb/>
            in the upper room. But I mention to you another man, to <lb/>
            whom thou mayest come, Eurymachus, the noble son of wise <lb/>
            Polybus, whom the Ithacans now regard equally as a god. <lb/>
            For he is by far the best man, and is especially desirous to <lb/>
            marry my mother, and to obtain the honour due to Ulysses. <lb/>
            But Olympian Jove, who dwells in the sky, knows this, if their <lb/>
            evil day will end before marriage."</p>
          <p>Whilst he spoke thus, a bird flew on his right hand, a <lb/>
            hawk, the swift messenger of Apollo ; and in its feet it tore a <lb/>
            dove, holding it, and poured the feathers down on the ground, <lb/>
            between the ship and Telemachus himself. But Theoclyme­ <lb/>
            nus, calling him apart from his companions, took hold of him <lb/>
            by the hand, and spoke and addressed him:</p>
          <p>"0 Telemachus, this bird did not fly on thy right hand <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            without [the design of] the deity; for when I Raw it before <lb/>
            me, I perceived that it was an omen. There is no other <lb/>
            family more kingly than thine amongst the people of Ithaca, <lb/>
            but ye are always powerful."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " I wish <lb/>
            this word may be brought to pass, O stranger: then thou <lb/>
            wouldst quickly experience my friendship, and many gifts <lb/>
            from me, so that any one who met thee would give thee <lb/>
            joy"</p>
          <p>He spoke, and addressed Piræus his faithful companion : <lb/>
            " O Piræus, f'on of Clytius, since thou even in other things <lb/>
            dost obey me most of my companions, who attended me to <lb/>
            Pylos; now also, taking the stranger to thy house, entertain <lb/>
            him carefully, and honour him until I come."</p>
          <p>But him spear-renowned Piræus answered in turn: " O <lb/>
            Telemachus, although thou remain here for a long time, I will <lb/>
            take care of this man, and there shall be no lack of hospitable <lb/>
            entertainment for him."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he went on board the ship, and he <lb/>
            ordered his companions both themselves to embark, and to <lb/>
            loose the halsers. But they quickly went on board, and sat <lb/>
            down on the benches. But Telemachus bound beautiful <lb/>
            sandals under his feet, and took a strong spear, tipped with <lb/>
            sharp brass, from the deck of the ship: and they loosed the <lb/>
            halsers. They having thrust out sailed to the city, as Telema­ <lb/>
            elms, the dear son of divine Ulysses, desired them. But his <lb/>
            feet carried him on quickly advancing, until he came to the <lb/>
            abode, where were his numberless swine, amongst which the <lb/>
            swineherd, excellent as he was, slept, having kind feelings <lb/>
            towards his masters.</p><pb n="217"/>

          <p>Telemachus, having been kindly received by Eumæus. converses with hit <lb/>
            father, without recognising him, and sends Eumæns to the city, to bear <lb/>
            the news of his return to Penelope. Minerva in the mean time restores <lb/>
            Ulysses to his former appearance, and he makes himself known to his <lb/>
            son. The suitors, who had lain in ambush for Telemachus, return to <lb/>
            Ithaca, and meditate fresh plots, for which Antinous is rebuked by <lb/>
            Penelope. Eumæus returns at night to Telemachus and Ulysses.</p>
          <p>THEY in the mean time, Ulysses and the divine swineherd, <lb/>
            were preparing their meal in the lodge together with the <lb/>
            dawn, having lit a fire, and they sent out the herdsmen with <lb/>
            the field-pasturing swine. But the barking dogs fawned about <lb/>
            Telemachus, nor did they bark at him as he approached : but <lb/>
            divine Ulysses perceived the dogs fawning, and the sound of <lb/>
            feet came about him: and he quickly addressed to Eumæus <lb/>
            winged words:</p>
          <p>" O Eumæus, certainly some companion of thine will come <lb/>
            hither, or some one else, who is known : since the dogs do not <lb/>
            bark, but fawn around him: and I hear somewhat the noise <lb/>
            of feet."</p>
          <p>Scarcely had he finished speaking, when his dear son stood <lb/>
            in the portico: and the swineherd rushed up astonished ; and <lb/>
            the vessels, with which he was busied, mixing the dark wine, <lb/>
            fell from his hands. And he came to meet the king ; and he <lb/>
            kissed his 1 head, and both his beautiful eyes, and both his <lb/>
            hands: and the warm tear fell from him. And as a father <lb/>
            being kindly disposed embraces his son, when he comes <lb/>
            from a foreign land in the tenth year, his only one, born to <lb/>

            and then lamenting he spoke winged words:</p>

            among the people ; for so it pleased thy mind, to be a witness <lb/>
            of the destructive3 crowd of suitors."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn: "Thus <lb/>
            shall it be, my friend ; but I come hither on account of thee, <lb/>
            that I may behold thee with mine eyes, and may hear thy <lb/>
            account whether my mother still remains in the palace, or <lb/>
            whether some other man has now wedded her; and the bed <lb/>
            of Ulysses through lack of furniture lies some where possess­ <lb/>
            ing foul cobwebs."4</p>
          <p>But him the swineherd, chief of men, addressed in turn : <lb/>
            " She by all means remains in thy palace, with a patient <lb/>
            mind: and by her weeping all her wretched nights and days <lb/>
            waste away."5</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he received his brazen spear; and he <lb/>
            went within, and passed over the stone threshold. And to hirr <lb/>
            approaching his father Ulysses gave way from his seat: but <lb/>
            Telemachus on the other side forbade him, and said : " Sit <lb/>
            down, O stranger; and we shall find a seat elsewhere in our <lb/>
            stall; and the man is near who will place it [for me]."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but he going immediately sat down: and <lb/>
            the swineherd spread green twigs under for him, and a fleece <lb/>
            above ; there then the dear son of Ulysses sat down. And near <lb/>
            them the swineherd placed dishes of roasted flesh, which they <lb/>
            eating had left on the day before: and he hastily heaped up <lb/>
            bread in baskets, and mixed sweet wine in an ivy cup: and <lb/>
            himself sat opposite divine Ulysses. And they stretched forth <lb/>
            their hands to the food lying ready before them. But when <lb/>
            they had taken away the desire of drinking and eating, then <lb/>
            Telemachus addressed the divine swineherd:</p>
          <p>" My friend, whence has this stranger come ? how did <lb/>
            sailors bring him to Ithaca? whom did they boast to be? for <lb/>
            I do not at all think that he came hither on foot." <note type="footnote"> 3 On <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀίδηλος</foreign> see Buttm. Lexil. p. 51, sqq. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Cf. Propert. iii. 6, 33, "Patris et in vacuo texetur aranea lecto." In <lb/>

          <p>But him thou didst thus address in answer, O swineherd <lb/>
            Eumæus : " Therefore I will tell thee all things truly, child. <lb/>
            He boasts his race [to be] from wide Crete, and he says that <lb/>
            wandering he has been tossed about to many cities of mortals ; <lb/>
            for so for him the deity destined these things. lie has now <lb/>
            at length come to my stall, having escaped from a ship of the <lb/>
            Thesprotians: but I will give him in charge to thee: do as <lb/>
            thou desirest ; he professes himself to be thy suppliant."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " O Eu­ <lb/>
            mæus, truly thou hast spoken this word very grievous to my <lb/>
            mind : for how shall I receive the stranger in my house ? I <lb/>
            myself am young, and I do not yet trust in my hands to ward <lb/>
            off a man, when any one is first wroth with me ; and my <lb/>
            mother's mind is meditating in doubt in her breast, whether <lb/>
            she should remain here with me, and should take care of the <lb/>
            house, reverencing the bed of her husband, and the voice of <lb/>
            the people, or should now accompany him of the Grecians, <lb/>
            whatever most excellent man woos her in the palace, and <lb/>
            offers her most [gifts]. But as to the stranger, since he has <lb/>
            come to thy house, I will put on him a cloak and tunic, beau­ <lb/>
            tiful garments ; and I will give to him a double-edged sword, <lb/>
            and sandals for his feet, and I will send him wherever his <lb/>
            heart and mind commands him. But if thou desirest it, take <lb/>
            care of him, detaining him in thy stalls : and I will send hither <lb/>
            garments, and all his food to eat, that he may not waste away <lb/>
            thee and thy companions. But I will not suffer him to go <lb/>
            there amongst the suitors ; for they possess too infatuate in­ <lb/>
            solence, lest they scoff at him, and there will be grievous <lb/>
            sorrow for me. But it is difficult for one man to do any thing <lb/>
            amongst many, although [he be] mighty ; since they are much <lb/>
            superior."</p>
          <p>But him much-enduring divine Ulysses addressed in turn: <lb/>
            " O my friend, since indeed it is lawful for me to answer, ye <lb/>
            much gall my heart, in truth, when I hear what shameful <lb/>
            things you say the suitors devise in the palace, against the <lb/>
            will of thee who art such a one. Tell me, whether thou art <lb/>
            willingly subdued, or do the people, following the voice of a <lb/>
            deity, hate thee publicly: or dost thou find any fault with <lb/>
            [the conduct of] brothers,6 in whom, fighting, a man is wont to <lb/>
            trust, even if a mighty contest should arise. For would that <note type="footnote"> 6 See Eustathius </note> <pb n="220"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="99—141,"/> <lb/>
            I were so young in this mind, or the son of blameless Ulysses, <lb/>
            or even himself [should come wandering, for there is still <lb/>
            some chance of hope], immediately then another man might <lb/>
            cut off my head, if I became not an evil to all of them, having <lb/>
            come to the palace of Ulysses, the son of Laertes. But if on <lb/>
            the contrary they should with numbers overcome me who am <lb/>
            alone, I should wish to die slain in mine own palace, rather <lb/>
            than always behold these unseemly deeds, strangers harshly <lb/>
            insulted,7 and [men] dragging women servants in an unseemly <lb/>
            way through the beautiful house: and wine drawn off, and <lb/>
            [the suitors] eating bread uselessly, to no purpose, without an <lb/>
            end, for a work that will never be accomplished."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " There­ <lb/>
            fore, O stranger, I will tell thee very truly ; neither are all the <lb/>
            people wroth with me, hating me, nor do I find fault with <lb/>
            brothers, in whom fighting a man is wont to trust, even if a <lb/>
            mighty conquest should arise. For thus has the son of Saturn <lb/>
            made our race single ; Arcesius begot an only son, Laertes, his <lb/>
            father again begot Ulysses alone; but Ulysses having begot­ <lb/>
            ten me alone, left me in the palace, nor did he have any joy <lb/>
            from me: therefore there are numberless enemies in our house. <lb/>
            For as many chieftains as rule over the islands, Dnlichium, <lb/>
            and Samos, and woody Zacynthus, and as many as rule over <lb/>
            rugged Ithaca, so many woo my mother, and waste our house­ <lb/>
            hold. But she does not refuse the hateful marriage, nor can <lb/>
            site bring it to a conclusion: but they waste away my pro <lb/>
            perty, consuming it ; and they will soon destroy me also myself. <lb/>
            But however these things lie at the knees of the gods. O <lb/>
            father, do thou go quickly, tell to prudent Penelope, that I am <lb/>
            safe, and have come from Pylos. But I will remain here: <lb/>
            and do thou return hither, having told it to her alone ; let not <lb/>
            any one of the other Grecians hear it: for many devise evils <lb/>
            against me."</p>
          <p>But him thou didst address in answer, O swineherd Eu­ <lb/>
            mæus : " I know it; I perceive it; thou speakest to one who <lb/>
            understands. But come, tell me this, and relate it truly, <lb/>
            shall I go a messenger on this same journey to unhappy <lb/>
            Laertes, who hitherto greatly grieving for Ulysses, used to <lb/>
            oversee the works, and drank and eat with the servants in <lb/>
            the house, when the mind in his breast commanded him: but <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_48_fig26.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="221"/>
              <note type="correspondsTo" n="42-180."/> <lb/>
              now, since thou hast gone in a ship to Pylos, they say that he <lb/>
              no longer eats and drinks any thing, nor looks over the works, <lb/>
              but he sits lamenting in groaning and sorrow and his flesh <lb/>
              wastes away around his bones."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " It is <lb/>
            rather sad; but however we will leave him although sorrowing. <lb/>
            For if all things were by any means to be chosen by mortals <lb/>
            themselves, first indeed I should choose the return of my <lb/>
            father. But do thou, when thou hast told thy news, come <lb/>
            back, nor do thou wander in the country after him : but tell <lb/>
            my mother to hasten the handmaiden, her housekeeper, as <lb/>
            quickly as possible, secretly: for she could inform the old <lb/>
            man."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and urged on the swineherd : but he took sandals <lb/>
            in his hands; and having bound them under his feet he went <lb/>
            to the city ; nor did the swineherd Eumæus, going from the <lb/>
            stall, escape the notice of Minerva: but she came near him, <lb/>
            and in her person she was likened unto a woman fair and large, <lb/>
            ands killed in renowned works of weaving. And she stood <lb/>
            at the entrance of the lodge, appearing to Ulysses ; nor did <lb/>
            Telemachus behold or perceive her ; (for the gods do not by <lb/>
            any means appear manifest to all;) but Ulysses and the dogs <lb/>
            saw her; and they did not bark, but with a yelping they fled <lb/>
            to the other side through the stall. But she nodded with her <lb/>
            eye-brows, and divine Ulysses perceived her; and he came <lb/>
            out of the house, outside the great wall of the hall, and he <lb/>
            stood before her; and him Minerva [thus] addressed:</p>
          <p>" O Jove-born son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses, now <lb/>
            tell it to thy son, nor conceal it, that having planned death <lb/>
            and Fate for the suitors, thou mayest go to the all-illustrious <lb/>
            city: nor will I myself be a long time away from thee, for I <lb/>
            am longing to fight."</p>
          <p>She spoke, and Minerva struck him with a golden rod: first <lb/>
            she placed a well-washed robe and tunic about his breast; and <lb/>
            bite increased his person and youth. And he again became <lb/>
            dark-coloured, and his cheeks were lengthened out; and dark <lb/>
            hairs sprang up about his chin. She indeed having done thus, <lb/>
            went away again ; but Ulysses went to the lodge; and his <lb/>
            dear son was astonished at him. And fearing he turned his <lb/>
            eyes elsewhere, lest it should be a god ; and addressing him, <lb/>
            he spoke winged words :</p><pb n="222"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="181—217"/>
          <p>" To me, O stranger, thon appearest just now a different <lb/>
            man from what thon wast before, thou hast other garments, <lb/>
            and thy complexion is no longer the same. Thou art certainly <lb/>
            some god, [of those] who possess the wide heaven. But be <lb/>
            propitious, that to thee we may offer grateful sacrifices, and <lb/>
            wrought golden presents : and spare us."</p>
          <p>But him much-enduring Ulysses immediately answered: <lb/>
            " I am no god : why likenest thou me to the Immortals ? but <lb/>
            I am thy father, for whose sake, thou mourning, dost suffer <lb/>
            many griefs, having endured the violence of men."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he kissed his son, and from his cheeks <lb/>
            he dropped a tear on the ground ; but before he had restrained <lb/>
            himself without ceasing. But Telemachus, (for he by no <lb/>
            means believed that it was his father,) immediately answering <lb/>
            in words addressed him:</p>
          <p>" Thou art not lilY father Ulysses ; but a deity cheats <lb/>
            me, that still more lamenting I may mourn : for a mortal man <lb/>
            could not have contrived these things by his own mind, ex­ <lb/>
            cept when a god himself coming upon him should easily, if <lb/>
            lie wished, make him young or old : for thou lately wast cer­ <lb/>
            tainly old, and wast clothed in unseemly guise, but now thou <lb/>
            art like unto the gods, who possess the wide heaven."</p>
          <p>But him much-contriving Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " O Telemachus, it is not right that thou shouldst beyond <lb/>
            measure marvel and be astonished at thy dear father being <lb/>
            within. For no other Ulysses will any more come here. <lb/>
            But I, who am such, having suffered ills, and wandered much, <lb/>
            have come in the twentieth year to my paternal land. But <lb/>
            this is the work of the huntress Minerva, who made me such <lb/>
            a one, as site wishes ;—for she has the power—at one time <lb/>
            like unto a beggar, at another again like unto a young man, <lb/>
            and to one that has beautiful garments around his body. But <lb/>
            it is easy for the gods, who possess the wide heaven, both to <lb/>
            exalt and to debase a mortal man."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he sat down ; but Telemachus, throw­ <lb/>
            ing himself round his excellent father, wept, shedding a tear. <lb/>
            And upon both of them a desire of mourning arose, and they <lb/>
            wept shrilly, more violently 8 than eagles, or crooked-taloned <lb/>
            vultures, from whom countrymen have taken their young <note type="footnote"> B See Buttm. Lexil. p. 32, 7. and p. 35, 5. </note> <pb n="223"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="218—256."/> <lb/>
            before they arc fledged ;9 so they indeed shed a lamentable <lb/>
            tear under their eyelids. And now, to them weeping, the <lb/>
            light of the sun would have set, had not Telemachus quickly <lb/>
            addressed his father:</p>
          <p>" In what ship, my dear father, did sailors bring thee hither <lb/>
            to Ithaca ? whom do they boast to be? for I do not at all think <lb/>
            that thou earnest here on foot."</p>
          <p>But him much-enduring divine Ulysses addressed in turn: <lb/>
            " Therefore I will tell thee the truth, my child: the ship- <lb/>
            renowned Phæacians brought me, who also escort other men, <lb/>
            whoever comes to them. And bringing me asleep in a swift <lb/>
            ship over the sea, they placed me in Ithaca ; and they gave to <lb/>
            me splendid gifts, brass, and gold in abundance, and woven <lb/>
            garments. And they lie in caves by the will of the gods. <lb/>
            But I am now come hither, by the suggestion of Minerva, <lb/>
            that we may consult about the slaughter of our enemies. But <lb/>
            come, enumerate the suitors to me, detail them, that I may <lb/>
            know both how many, and what men they are: then meditat­ <lb/>
            ing in my blameless mind, I will consider, if indeed we shall <lb/>
            be able to resist them alone without others, or must also seek <lb/>
            for others."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " O father, <lb/>
            indeed I have always heard of thy great glory, that thou wast <lb/>
            a warrior as to thine hands and prudent in counsel. But <lb/>
            thou hast spoken something very great, astonishment pos­ <lb/>
            sesses me: it would not be possible, that two men should con­ <lb/>
            tend with many and strong men. There are truly not ten <lb/>
            suitors, nor twice ten only, but many more : and you will now <lb/>
            soon know the number. From Dulichium indeed there are <lb/>
            two and fifty chosen youths, and six servants follow them : <lb/>
            and from Samos there are four and twenty men; and from <lb/>
            Zacynthus there are twenty youths of the Grecians ; and <lb/>
            from Ithaca itself twelve, all most excellent: and with them <lb/>
            there is the herald Medon, and the divine bard, and two serv­ <lb/>
            ants, skilled in cooking. If we should meet with all these <lb/>
            within, [I dread] lest coming thou wouldst bitterly and griev­ <lb/>
            ously 10 be revenged on their violence. But do thou, if thou <figure type="illustration">

              eanst think of any assistant, mention him ; whoever would aid <lb/>
              us with a ready mind."</p>
          <p>But him much-enduring divine Ulysses addressed in turn: <lb/>
            "Therefore I will tell thee ; and do thou attend, and listen to <lb/>
            me, and consider, if Minerva, with father Jove, will suffice <lb/>
            for us, or shall I think of some other assistant ?"</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " These <lb/>
            twain whom thou mentionest are excellent assistants, although <lb/>
            silting on high in the clouds ; they also rule over other men, <lb/>
            and the immortal gods."</p>
          <p>But him much-enduring divine Ulysses addressed in turn: <lb/>
            "They twain indeed will not be a long time absent from the <lb/>
            severe contest, when the strength of Mars is determined in <lb/>
            my palace between the suitors and us. But do thou go home, <lb/>
            with the dawning moin, and associate with the perfidious <lb/>
            suitors: but the swineherd shall afterwards take me to the <lb/>
            city, like unto a sordid beggar and aged man. And if they <lb/>
            shall dishonour me in the house, let thy dear heart endure it <lb/>
            in thy breast, when I am ill treated, although they should drag <lb/>
            me through the house by my feet, or should strike at me with <lb/>
            weapons: but do thou looking on restrain thyself; but, <lb/>
            however, desire them to cease from their foolishness, speaking <lb/>
            to them with mild words; but they will not obey thee; for <lb/>
            their fatal day now stands near them. [And11 I tell thee <lb/>
            something else, but do thou lay it up in thy mind; when <lb/>
            much-counselling Minerva shall put it in my mind, I will nod <lb/>
            to thee with my head ; do thou then, when thou perceivest it, <lb/>
            take as many warlike arms as lie in the palace, and place them <lb/>
            in the recess of the lofty chamber; but deceive the suitors <lb/>
            with mild words, when desiring them they inquire of you, <lb/>
            [saying,] 'I have placed them out of the smoke ; since they <lb/>
            are no longer like unto those, which Ulysses left, departing <lb/>
            for Troy, but they are soiled, as far as the vapour of the <lb/>
            lire has reached them. But this also of still greater conse­ <lb/>
            quence the SOil of Saturn has put in my mind, lest by chance <lb/>
            intoxicated, having raised a quarrel amongst you, ye should <lb/>
            wound one another, and disgrace the feast, and the wooing ; <lb/>
            for the steel of itself draws on a man.' 12 But for us alone <note type="footnote"> " There is much doubt respecting this passage as far as vs. 298. See <lb/>
            Clarke. 12 Clarke aptly compares Tacitus, Hist. i. bO, " et visa inter <lb/>

            to take in our hands: that rushing upon them we may seize <lb/>
            them ; but then Pallas Minerva and provident Jove will soften <lb/>
            them.'13] But I tell thee something else, and do thou by it <lb/>

            let no one hear of Ulysses as being within, let not Laertes <lb/>

            nor Penelope herself: but thou and I alone may learn the dis­ <lb/>
            position of the women ; and we may besides try the men­ <lb/>
            servants, both who honours us and fears us in his mind, and <lb/>
            who disregards us, and dishonours thee who art such."</p>
          <p>But him his glorious son in answer addressed : " O father, <lb/>
            truly I think thou wilt know my mind even hereafter; for <lb/>
            laxity of mind does not by any means possess me ; but I do <lb/>
            not think this will be a profit to either of us; and I exhort <lb/>
            thee to consider. For thus thou wilt sit for a long time try­ <lb/>
            ing each, going over the works ; but they quiet in the palace <lb/>
            are consuming thy possessions with violence, nor is there any <lb/>
            sparing. But, however, I exhort thee to find out the women, <lb/>
            both who dishonour thee, and who are innocent; but I should <lb/>
            not wish that we should try the men at their abodes, but <lb/>
            to manage these things afterwards, if at least thou art surely <lb/>
            acquainted with some sign from Ægis-bearing Jove."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke to one another. But in the mean <lb/>
            while the well-built ship, which brought Telemachus and <lb/>
            all his companions from Pylos, was drawn up to Ithaca : <lb/>
            but when they now came within the very deep haven, they <lb/>
            drew the black ship upon the shore, and the noble-minded <lb/>
            servants took away their arms ; and they immediately carried <lb/>
            the beautiful presents to Clytius' [house]. And they sent a <lb/>
            herald forward to the house of Ulysses, to tell the news to <lb/>
            prudent Penelope, that Telemachus was in the country, but <lb/>
            had commanded the ship to sail to the city: that the noble <lb/>
            queen, fearing in her mind, might not shed a tender tear. <lb/>
            And the herald and the divine swineherd met together, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of the same message, to tell it to the lady. But when <lb/>
            they reached the house of the divine king, the herald said in <lb/>
            the middle of the handmaidens : "Now indeed, O queen, thy <lb/>
            dear son is arrived."</p>
          <p>But the swineherd, standing near Penelope, told all the <note type="footnote"> 13 i. e. make them cowards. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="330—375."/> <lb/>
            things, whatever her dear son had commanded him to relate. <lb/>
            And after lie had told all his commission, he then went to go <lb/>
            to the swine, and he left the enclosures and the palace. But <lb/>
            the suitors were vexed and astounded in their mind : and they <lb/>
            come out of the palace, outside the great wall of the hall, and <lb/>
            there they sat before the doors : but Eurymachus, son of Poly­ <lb/>
            bus, began to harangue them :</p>
          <p>" O friends, a daring deed has in truth been performed <lb/>
            with mighty boldness by Telemachus, this voyage [forsooth]; <lb/>
            but we said it would not be accomplished. But come, we will <lb/>
            draw out a black ship, whichever is the best; and will collect <lb/>
            together fishermen for rowers, who with all haste may bid <lb/>
            them return home quickly."</p>
          <p>Scarcely had all been said, when Amphinomns, turn­ <lb/>
            ing from his place,14 beheld the ship within the very deep <lb/>
            haven, and Ethic crew] furling the sails, and holding the oars <lb/>
            in their hands. And laughing pleasantly, he addressed his <lb/>
            companions :</p>
          <p>" We need not any more urge on any message; for they <lb/>
            are within ; either some one of the gods has told this to them, <lb/>
            or they have themselves seen the ship passing, but could not <lb/>
            reach it."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but they rising up, went to the shore of <lb/>
            the sea. And they immediately drew the black ship on the <lb/>
            shore, and the noble-minded servants took away their arms. <lb/>
            But they went together to the assembly, nor did they suffer <lb/>
            any one of the others, either young or old, to sit with them : <lb/>
            but Antinous, son of Eupithes, addressed them:</p>
          <p>" Alas ! how have the gods freed this man from evil. Dur­ <lb/>
            ing the days, spies in continual succession sat on the windy <lb/>
            promontories; and with the setting sun we never slept on <lb/>
            shore during the night, but sailing with our swift ship in the sea, <lb/>
            we waited for the divine Moin, lying in ambush for Telema­ <lb/>
            chus, that having taken, we might destroy him : but in the <lb/>
            mean while the deity has brought him home. But let us here <lb/>
            devise mournful destruction for Telemachus; nor let him escape <lb/>
            us ; for I do not think that, while he is alive, at least, these <lb/>
            things will be accomplished.15 For he is himself knowing in <lb/>
            counsel and in thought; nor do the people any longer at all <note type="footnote"> 14 i. c. changing his position. See Iniusti. </note><note type="footnote"> 15 The marriage of Penelope. </note> <pb n="227"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="375—415."/> <lb/>
            bring agreeable things to us. But come, before he collects <lb/>
            the Greeks together to a meeting ; (for I do not think that he <lb/>
            will leave off, but he will be wrath with us, and rising up, he <lb/>
            will tell amongst all, that we planned violent death for him. <lb/>
            and did not reach him. But they, hearing [our] evil deeds, will <lb/>
            not approve ;) for fear they should do evil, and drive us out of <lb/>
            our own land, and we should come to another people. But <lb/>
            let us anticipate him, destroying [him] in the country at a <lb/>
            distance from the city, or on the way: and let us ourselves <lb/>
            have his property and possessions, dividing them amongst us <lb/>
            by shares, and afterwards we may give the house to his mother <lb/>
            to possess, and to whomsoever weds her. But if this advice <lb/>
            displeases you, and you wish both that he should live, and <lb/>
            possess all his ancestral property, then let not is, here assem­ <lb/>
            bled, consume his mind-delighting property to excess ; but let <lb/>
            each out of the palace woo her, seeking her with dowries: <lb/>
            and she then may marry whoever gives her most [gifts], and <lb/>
            comes destined [for her husband]."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, but they all became mute in silence. And <lb/>
            Amphinomus harangued and addressed them, the illustrious <lb/>
            son of Nisus, son of king Aretias, who led the suitors from <lb/>
            wheat-abounding, grassy Dulichium ; and he especially pleased <lb/>
            Penelope by his words; for he possessed an excellent mind. <lb/>
            Who being well-disposed, harangued and addressed them:</p>
          <p>" O friends, I indeed should not wish to slay Telemachus : <lb/>
            it is a terrible thing to slay one of royal race : but first let us <lb/>
            ask the counsel of the gods; and if the oracles of mighty <lb/>
            Jove advise it, I myself will slay him, and will encourage all <lb/>
            the rest; but if the gods turn us away from it, I exhort you <lb/>
            to cease."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Amphinomus; and his discourse pleased them : <lb/>
            immediately then rising up, they went to the house of Ulysses, <lb/>
            and when they came they sat down upon polished thrones. <lb/>
            But prudent Penelope thought of something new, to appear <lb/>
            to the suitors who possess extravagant insolence; for she <lb/>
            heard in the palace of the [threatened] destruction of her soil ; <lb/>
            for the herald Medon, who heard their counsels, told her. <lb/>
            And she went to the palace, with her women attendants ; but <lb/>
            when the divine one of women had come to the suitors, she <lb/>
            then stood near the pillar of the firmly-made roof, holding up <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="416-452"/> <lb/>
            a slendor veil before her cheeks; and she chided Antinous, <lb/>
            and spoke and addressed him by name:</p>
          <p>"0 Antinous, thou who possessest insolence, thou contriver <lb/>
            of evil, they say indeed that thou art the most excellent <lb/>
            amongst those of thine age in the people of Ithaca in counsel <lb/>
            and in words : but thou indeed art not such a one. Frantic <lb/>
            one, why dost thou devise death and fate for Telemachus, nor <lb/>
            revere suppliants, for whom Jove is a witness ? it is not holy <lb/>
            to devise evils against one another. Dost thou not know, <lb/>
            when thy father came hither a fugitive, dreading the people? <lb/>
            for they were very wroth, because following Taphian pirates <lb/>
            he injured the Thesprotians ; and they were our friends ; they <lb/>
            wished to destroy him, and to tear in pieces his dear heart, and <lb/>
            to consume his large strength-yielding livelihood: but Ulysses <lb/>
            hindered and kept them off, although anxious. His house <lb/>
            thou now consumest in dishonour, and wooest his wife, and <lb/>
            slayest his son, and dost greatly afflict me. But I charge thee <lb/>
            to cease, and to exhort the others [to do so]."</p>
          <p>But her Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered in turn: <lb/>
            " O daughter of Icarus, prudent Penelope, be confident, let <lb/>
            not these things be a care to thee in thy mind. There is not <lb/>
            that man, nor will there be, nor can there be born, who shall <lb/>
            by his hands on thy son Telemachus, at least whilst I am <lb/>
            alive, and behold [the light] upon the earth. For thus I tell <lb/>
            thee, and it shall indeed be performed, his black blood shall <lb/>
            quickly flow around my spear; since city-destroying Ulysses <lb/>
            often having seated me on his knees, put roasted flesh in my <lb/>
            hands, and gave me ruby wine. Therefore to me Telemachus <lb/>
            is far dearest of all men ; nor do I advise him at all to fear <lb/>
            death from the suitors ; but from the gods it is not possible to <lb/>
            avoid it."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, cheering [her], but he himself prepared <lb/>
            destruction for him. She ascending to the splendid16 upper <lb/>
            rooms, wept then for her beloved husband Ulysses; until <lb/>
            blue-eyed Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eye-brows. And <lb/>
            in the evening the divine swineherd came to Ulysses and his <note type="footnote"> 16 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σιγαλόεντα</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ τὰ σιγω̃ντα, ἀλλὰ τὰ ἐμποιου̃ντα σιγὴ τῳ̃ βλέ­ <lb/>

            son : and they were preparing supper skilfully,17 having slain <lb/>
            a pigling porker of one year old: but Minerva, standing near <lb/>
            Ulysses, son of Laertes, having smote him with a rod, again made <lb/>
            him an old man : and she put sad garments about his body ; that <lb/>
            the swineherd might not know him, beholding him opposite, <lb/>
            and come telling the news to prudent Penelope, nor keep it in <lb/>
            his mind. And to him Telemachus first addressed discourse:</p>
          <p>" Thou art come, divine Eumæus ; what is now the report <lb/>
            through the city ? are the haughty suitors now from their <lb/>
            ambush ? or do they still wait for me as I return home ?"</p>
          <p>But him thou didst address in answer, O swineherd Eu­ <lb/>
            mæns : " It was not a care to me to inquire and ask these <lb/>
            things, as I was going through the city; but my mind urged <lb/>
            me, having given my message, to return hither again as <lb/>
            quickly as possible. But a swift messenger, a herald from thy <lb/>
            companions, met with me, who first told the thing to thy <lb/>
            mother. But this I know, for I beheld it with mine eyes; I <lb/>
            was just now going beyond the city, where is the Hermæan <lb/>
            hill,18 when I beheld a swift ship coming down to our port; and <lb/>
            there were many men in it; and it was heavy with shields <lb/>
            and double-edged spears; and I thought that it was they; <lb/>
            yet I know not [for certain]."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, but the sacred might of Telemachus smiled, <lb/>
            looking upon his father with his eyes; but he avoided the <lb/>
            swineherd. But when they had ceased from toil, and had got <lb/>
            ready a feast, they feasted; nor was their mind at all in want <lb/>
            of an equal banquet. But when they had taken away the <lb/>
            desire of drinking and eating, then they were mindful of the <lb/>
            couch, and enjoyed the gift of sleep. <note type="footnote"> 17 See note on xiii. 52. Here : follow the second interpretation of <lb/>

          <p>the following day Telemachus goes to the city, and gives an account of <lb/>
            his voyage to Penelope ; Theoclymenus, whom he introduces, foretells the <lb/>
            speedy return of Ulysses, whom Eumæus conducts to the city, and takes <lb/>
            to the palace, where he is recognised by his old dog Argus, who dies at <lb/>
            his feet. Ulysses then goes amongst the suitors, by whom he is treated <lb/>
            with insolence: Penelope hearing of him, as a stranger, from Eumæus, <lb/>
            sends for him; but he declines to go to her until the evening, when the <lb/>
            suitors have left the palace. Eumaeus then returns to the country.</p>
          <p>BUT when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered morning, ap­ <lb/>
            peared, then Telemachus, the dear son of divine Ulysses, <lb/>
            bound beautiful sandals under his feet: and he took a strong <lb/>
            spear which fitted his hands, setting out towards the city, and <lb/>
            he addressed his swineherd :</p>
          <p>" Father, I am going to the city, that my mother may see <lb/>
            me (for I do not think that she will cease from hateful <lb/>
            mourning and tearful grief before she beholds me myself): <lb/>
            but thus I charge thee, bring the unhappy stranger to the <lb/>
            city, that he may there beg a meal; but whoever chooses will <lb/>
            give him a meal-cake and a small measure1 [of drink] ; but <lb/>
            it is not possible for me to support all men, having griefs in <lb/>
            my mind. But if the stranger is very wroth, it will be sadder <lb/>
            for him ; for the truth is dear to me to speak."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " O my friend, I myself indeed do not wish to be detained; <lb/>
            it is better for a beggar to beg a meal in a city, than in the <lb/>
            country ; for whoever chooses will give to me. For I am no <lb/>
            longer of such an age to remain at the stalls, so as to obey a <lb/>
            master who commands me in every thing. But go ; this man, <lb/>
            whom thou desirest, will lead me to the city immediately, at <lb/>
            least when I am warmed with the fire, and there is heat from <lb/>
            the sun ; (for these garments which I have are very sad ones ;) <lb/>
            lest the morning frost should overcome me; and ye say the <lb/>
            city is far off."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke: but Telemachus went through the abode, <lb/>
            swiftly stepping forward with his feet: and he brooded evils <lb/>
            for the suitors. But when he reached the well-built dwelling, <note type="footnote"> I See Liddell's Lexicon.. </note> <pb n="231"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="20—07."/> <lb/>
            taking his spear, he placed it against the lofty column, and he <lb/>
            himself went in, and passed over the stone threshold.</p>
          <p>And him did the nurse Euryclea behold much the first, as she <lb/>
            was spreading fleeces upon the variegated thrones : then weep­ <lb/>
            ing she went straight forward ; and the other handmaidens of <lb/>
            wretched Ulysses were assembled around him, and embracing <lb/>
            him they kissed his head and shoulders. And prudent Pent.­ <lb/>
            lope came from her chamber, like unto Diana and golden <lb/>
            Venus: and she threw her arms around her dear son, weeping. <lb/>
            And she kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes ; and la­ <lb/>
            menting addressed to him winged words:</p>
          <p>" Thou art come, O Telemachus, my sweet light: I did not <lb/>
            think that I should behold thee anymore, when thou didst go <lb/>
            in a ship to Pylos secretly, against my will, to inquire for <lb/>
            thy dear father; but come, tell me what sight thou hast en­ <lb/>
            countered."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " O my <lb/>
            mother, do not raise grief unto me, nor excite the heart <lb/>
            within the breast of me, who have escaped bitter destruction. <lb/>
            But having washed thyself, and taken clean garments for thy <lb/>
            body, [ascending to the upper-rooms with thy women attend­ <lb/>
            ants,] vow to all the gods that thou wilt offer up sacred <lb/>
            hecatombs, if Jove will by any means execute deeds of venge­ <lb/>
            ance. But I will go to the place of meeting, that I may invite <lb/>
            a stranger, who attended me from thence, as I was coming <lb/>
            hither. Him I sent on indeed with my godlike companions : <lb/>
            and I ordered Piræus, leading him home, to entertain him, and <lb/>
            honour him heartily, until I should come."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but the word was unwinged.2 But she, <lb/>
            having washed herself, [and] taken clean garments for her <lb/>
            body, vowed to all the gods, that she would offer up sacred <lb/>
            hecatombs, if by any means Jove would execute deeds of <lb/>
            vengeance. But Telemachus then went through out of the <lb/>
            palace, holding his spear: and swift-footed dogs accompanied <lb/>
            him. But Minerva shed divine grace upon him: and all the <lb/>
            people admired him as he came. And the haughty suitors <lb/>
            were assembled around him, speaking good words, but they <lb/>
            planned evils deeply in their minds. And he immediately <note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. it proved effectual, it made an impression on the mind of Pene­ <lb/>

            avoided the great crowd of them ; but where Mentor sat, <lb/>
            and Antiphus, and Alitherses, (who from the beginning were <lb/>
            his ancestral friends,) there going, he sat down ; and they in­ <lb/>
            quired every thing [of him]. And spear-renowned Piræus <lb/>
            came near them, bringing the stranger through the city to <lb/>
            the forum : nor was Telemachus a long time turned far away <lb/>
            from the stranger, but he stood near him. And him Piræus <lb/>
            first addressed in words:</p>
          <p>" O Telemachus, quickly incite women [to go] to my house, <lb/>
            that I may send away the presents, which Menelaus gave to <lb/>
            thee."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " O <lb/>
            Piræus, we know not how these things will be; if the <lb/>
            haughty suitors, slaying me secretly in the palace, should <lb/>
            divide all my ancestral property, I wish that thou or some one <lb/>
            of these should keep and enjoy them ; but if I shall plant <lb/>
            death and fate for them, then rejoicing bring them to me re­ <lb/>
            joicing, to my dwelling."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he led the much-worn stranger home. <lb/>
            But when they reached the well-built house, they laid their <lb/>
            cloaks down upon the benches and thrones, and going into <lb/>
            the well-polished baths they washed themselves. But when <lb/>
            the handmaidens had washed them, and anointed them with <lb/>
            oil, they threw woollen cloaks and garments around them, <lb/>
            and going out of the bath, they sat down upon the benches. <lb/>
            And a handmaiden bringing water in a beautiful golden <lb/>
            ewer, poured it over a silver cauldron, to wash in ; and near <lb/>
            them she spread a polished table. And the venerable house­ <lb/>
            keeper bringing food set it near them, placing on it many <lb/>
            kinds of meat, gratifying them as well as she could out of <lb/>
            what was present. But his mother sat opposite [to IiiJ, <lb/>
            near a column of the palace, reclining on a bench, twisting <lb/>
            her slender distaff. And they stretched forth their hands to <lb/>
            the food lying ready before them. But when they had taken <lb/>
            away the desire of drinking and eating, prudent Penelope <lb/>
            began speaking to them :</p>
          <p>"O Telemachus, I indeed ascending to the upper room, <lb/>
            will lie down on my bed, which to me has become mournful, <lb/>
            ever being bedewed with my tears, since Ulysses went with <lb/>
            the Atridæ to Hium : nor hast thou endured, before the <lb/>
            haughty suitors came to this house, to tell me clearly con. <pb n="233"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="107—149."/> <lb/>
            cerning the return of thy father, whether thou hast any <lb/>
            where heard of him."</p>
          <p>And her prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " There­ <lb/>
            fore I will tell thee, mother, the truth. We went to Pylos, <lb/>
            and to Nestor, the shepherd of the people; and he, having <lb/>
            received me in his lofty house, entertained me heartily, as a <lb/>
            father does a son who has just come from elsewhere after a <lb/>
            long season ; so diligently did he take care of me, with his <lb/>
            renowned sons. But he said that he had not heard of wretched <lb/>
            Ulysses, alive or dead, from any one of men upon the earth; <lb/>
            but he sent me on with horses, and a compact chariot, to spear- <lb/>
            renowned Menelaus, son of Atreus. There I beheld Argive <lb/>
            Helen, on whose account the Argives and Trojans toiled much, <lb/>
            through the will of the gods. Immediately then Menelaus, <lb/>
            gallant in the din of battle, inquired, what wishing, I had <lb/>
            come to divine Lacedæmon. But I told him the whole truth. <lb/>
            And then indeed answering me with words, he addressed me: <lb/>
            ' Alas ! surely indeed they being weak have wished to sleep in <lb/>
            the bed of a noble-minded man. As when a stag having put <lb/>
            to sleep her new-born suckling kids in the den of a strong lion, <lb/>
            tracks out the slopes and grassy vales, seeking pasture ; but he <lb/>
            has quickly entered into his lair, and upon both of them has <lb/>
            brought unseemly fate : so will Ulysses bring unseemly fate <lb/>
            upon them. May he, O father Jove, and Minerva, and <lb/>
            Apollo, being such, as once in well-built Lesbos, having risen <lb/>
            up. he wrestled in contest with Philomelides, and threw him <lb/>
            nobly, and all the Grecians rejoiced: [would that], being <lb/>
            such, Ulysses may engage with the suitors: all would then <lb/>
            be quick-fated, and bitterly married. But as to these things, <lb/>
            which thou askest and entreatest of me, I will not tell thee <lb/>
            other things out of the way, turning aside, nor will I deceive <lb/>
            thee: but the things which the true-speaking old man of the <lb/>
            sea told me, of these I will not conceal or hide a word. lie <lb/>
            said that he beheld him in an island having violent griefs, <lb/>
            in the palace of the nymph Calypso, who detains him by <lb/>
            necessity ; but he cannot come to his paternal land ; for there <lb/>
            are not ships with oars for him, and companions who may <lb/>
            escort him over the wide back of the sea.' Thus spoke spear- <lb/>
            renowned Menelaus, son of Atreus. Having finished these <lb/>
            things, I returned: and the immortals, who sent me quickly <lb/>
            to my dear country, gave me a prosperous gale."</p><pb n="234"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="150—188"/>
          <p>Thus he spoke, and he moved her mind in her breast. But <lb/>
            godlike Theoclymenus addressed them:</p>
          <p>"0 venerable wife of Ulysses, SOil of Laertes: he indeed <lb/>
            does not know it clearly; but do thou regard my discourse; <lb/>
            for I will prophesy accurately to thee, nor will I conceal it. <lb/>
            Now let Jove, first of the gods, be witness, and thine hos­ <lb/>
            pitable table, and the hearth of blameless Ulysses, to which <lb/>
            I come, that Ulysses indeed is now sitting in his paternal <lb/>
            land, or walking, inquiring concerning these evil deeds, but <lb/>
            lie is planting evil for all the suitors. Such augury I beheld, <lb/>
            sitting on the well-benched ship, and I called out to Telema­ <lb/>
            chus."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn: "I wish, O <lb/>
            stranger, this word may be accomplished, then wouldst thou <lb/>
            speedily experience my friendship, and [receive] many gifts <lb/>
            from me, so that any one meeting with thee would give thee <lb/>
            joy."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke to one another. But the suitors be­ <lb/>
            fore the palace of Ulysses were delighted with quoits, and <lb/>
            hurling with javelins on the wrought pavement, where even <lb/>
            before they practised their insolence. But when it was now <lb/>
            supper-time, and the cattle came from the country on all <lb/>
            sides, and they brought them, who before [used to bring <lb/>
            them]: then indeed did Medon address them, for he most <lb/>
            pleased them of the heralds, and with them was present at <lb/>
            the feast:</p>
          <p>" O youths, since ye have all been delighted in your mind <lb/>
            with contests, come to the house, that we may make ready a <lb/>
            feast, for it is by no means bad to take supper at the proper <lb/>
            season."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, but they rising up went, and obeyed his <lb/>
            word. But when they came to the well-built dwelling, they <lb/>
            laid their cloaks down on the benches and thrones, and sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed large sheep and fat goats: and they sacrificed fatted <lb/>
            swine, and a cow from the herd, making ready a feast: but <lb/>
            Ulysses and the divine swineherd hastened to go from the <lb/>
            country to the city. But to them the swineherd, chief of men, <lb/>
            began discourse:</p>
          <p>" O stranger, since thou indeed desirest to go to-day to the <lb/>
            city, as my master ordered, (go) ; certainly I should wish thee to <lb/>
            be here a guardian of the stalls ; but I reverence and fear him, <pb n="235"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="188—219."/> <lb/>
            lest afterwards he should be wroth with me: now the chidings <lb/>
            of masters are severe. But come now, let us go: for the day <lb/>
            is now almost gone by,3 but soon indeed towards evening it <lb/>
            will be more chilly."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " I know it, I am aware of it; thou commandest these things <lb/>
            to one who understands. But let us go: do thou then lead <lb/>
            the way throughout. But give me, if thou by chance hast <lb/>
            one cut, a staff to lean upon, since thou sayest that it is a <lb/>
            slippery way."</p>
          <p>He spoke; and around his shoulders threw an unseemly <lb/>
            satchel, densely ragged ; but there was a twisted cord4 to hold <lb/>
            it. But Eumæus gave him a mind-delighting staff. They <lb/>
            twain went along: but the dogs and herdsmen remaining be­ <lb/>
            hind, defended the stall: and he led his master to the city, <lb/>
            like unto a squalid beggar and an old man, leaning on a staff: <lb/>
            and miserable garments were put upon his body. But when <lb/>
            now treading the rugged way they were near the city, and <lb/>
            reached the beautiful-flowing fountain, wrought by men's <lb/>
            hands,5 from whence the citizens drew water, which Ithacus <lb/>
            and Neritus and Polyctor made: and around there was a <lb/>
            grove of water-nurtured poplars circular on all sides, and cold <lb/>
            water flowed down from a rock from on high ; and there was <lb/>
            an altar of the Nymphs built above it, where all travellers <lb/>
            made offerings. There Melanthius, son of Dolius, found <lb/>
            them, bringing those goats which surpassed all the flocks, as <lb/>
            a supper for the suitors: and two attendants followed him. <lb/>
            But seeing [them], he chided them, and spoke and addressed <lb/>
            them in a violent and unseemly manner; and he roused the <lb/>
            heart of Ulysses [by saying thus] :</p>
          <p>" Now indeed by all means the vile leads the vile; so the <lb/>
            deity ever brings the like to the like.6 Where, O unenvied <note type="footnote"> a Observe the perfect <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέμβλωκε</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">βλώσκω</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρόφος ἀορτὴρ</foreign> is what we should call in English " a bracer," or <lb/>

            swineherd, dost thou lead this hungry fellow, a wretched beggar, <lb/>
            a destroyer of feasts : who, standing near many door-posts, will <lb/>
            rub his shoulders, begging morsels, not tripods or cauldrons ?7 <lb/>
            If thou wouldst give him to me to be a guard of my stalls, <lb/>
            and to he a sweeper of the folds, and to carry a branch [of <lb/>
            herbs] for the kids,8 then drinking whey, lie would render <lb/>
            his thighs stout. But since then he indeed has learnt evil <lb/>
            works, lie will not be willing to go to work,9 but crouching <lb/>
            amongst the people, he prefers10 asking alms to feed his in­ <lb/>
            satiable belly. But I tell thee plainly,11 and this shall be <lb/>
            accomplished, if he comes to the dwelling of divine Ulysses, <lb/>

          <p>Thus he spoke ; and going by him, he in his foolishness leapt <lb/>
            upon his haunch with his heel ; nor did he thrust him out of the <lb/>
            path, but he remained without stumbling ; and Ulysses medi­ <lb/>
            tated, whether rushing swiftly upon him, he should take away <lb/>
            his life with a club, or should dash his head against the earth, <lb/>
            raising him on the ground. But he endured it, and he re­ <lb/>
            frained in his mind: but the swineherd chided him, looking <lb/>
            at him: and uplifting his hands, he prayed aloud:</p>
          <p>" O fountain Nymphs, ye daughters of Jove, if ever Ulysses <lb/>
            has burnt thighs for you, covering them with the rich fat, of <lb/>

            the palace, or may he be subdued under the suitors, as the <lb/>

          <p>Thus having spoken, he left them there going slowly, but <lb/>
            lie went on, and very quickly reached the dwelling of the <lb/>
            king. And he immediately went in, and sat down among the <lb/>
            suitors, opposite Eurymachus: for he loved him very much. <lb/>
            Those who ministered placed near him his share of food, and <lb/>
            the venerable housekeeper bringing bread, set it near him to <lb/>
            eat: and Ulysses and the divine swineherd coming stood near; <lb/>
            and the sound of the hollow lyre came about them ; for Phe­ <lb/>
            mins struck up to sing; but he, taking the swineherd by the <lb/>
            hand, [thus] addressed him :</p>
          <p>" Eumæus, of a truth this dwelling of Ulysses is very <lb/>
            beautiful and easy to distinguish, even to behold amongst <lb/>
            many. There is one [story] above another; and the court is <lb/>
            ornamented with a wall and battlements, and there are well­ <lb/>
            closing14 folding-doors; no man would scoff at it.15 But I <lb/>
            perceive that many men are making a banquet in it; since <lb/>
            the smoke of the fat16 rises up, and the lyre speaks within, <lb/>
            which the gods have made a companion to the feast."</p>
          <p>But him thou didst address in answer, O swineherd Eu­ <lb/>
            mæus : " Thou knowest it well; since as to other things thou <lb/>
            art not unintelligent: but come, let us now consider how <lb/>
            these things will be. Either do thou first enter the well-built <lb/>
            house, and go amongst the suitors, and I will remain behind <lb/>

            these things."</p>
          <p>But him much-enduring divine Ulysses then answered : <lb/>
            " I know it; I am aware of it; thou commandest these things <lb/>
            to one who understands. But do thou go before, and I will <lb/>

            blows; my mind is daring, since I have suffered many evils <lb/>
            on the waves, and in war: and let this happen after these. <lb/>
            But it is not possible to conceal a craving belly, pernicious, <lb/>
            which gives many evils to men: on account of this even well- <lb/>
            yoked ships are fitted out for the barren sea, bringing evils to <lb/>
            the hostile."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke to one another. But Argus, the door of <lb/>
            patient Ulysses, lying down, held up his head and ears, [the <lb/>
            dog] which he himself formerly nourished, nor did he enjoy <lb/>
            the use [of him] : but he previously went away to sacred <lb/>
            Ilium : but young men had before led him against wild goats, <lb/>
            and harts, and hares. There he lay cast out, his master hav­ <lb/>
            ing gone away, amongst much dung of mules and oxen, which <lb/>
            was spread before the doors in great quantities: until the <lb/>
            servants of Ulysses should take it away to manure the exten­ <lb/>
            sive ground : there by the do- Argus, full of vermin. Then, <lb/>
            when he saw Ulysses near, he fawned with his tail, and laid <lb/>
            down both his ears: but he could no more come nearer his <lb/>
            master; but lie beholding him at a distance wiped away a <lb/>
            tear, easily escaping the notice of Eumæus : but he inquired <lb/>
            of him immediately:</p>
          <p>" O Euticus, it is indeed a wonder ; this dog lies in the <lb/>
            manure; he is beautiful as to his body, but this I do not well <lb/>
            know, whether besides his beauty of form he was swift to run, <lb/>
            or uselessly, as arc the dogs at the tables of men, his masters <lb/>
            take care of him for the sake of ornament."</p>
          <p>But him thou didst address in answer, O swineherd Eu­ <lb/>
            mæus : This indeed is the dog of a man who has died far <lb/>
            off. If he were such, both in body and in feats, as Ulysses <lb/>
            left him, when going to Troy, thou wouldst soon be surprised, <lb/>
            beholding his swiftness and courage. For he did not fly from <lb/>
            any monster that he had pursued in the thickets of the deep wood: <lb/>
            and he was well acquainted with their tracks: but he is now <lb/>
            possessed by misfortune: and his master has perished elsewhere <lb/>
            away from his country ; and the neglectful women do not <lb/>
            take care of him. But servants, when their masters no longer <lb/>
            rule over them, are then no longer willing to do proper <lb/>
            things: for loud-sounding Jove takes away half the excellence <lb/>
            of a man, when the day of slavery seizes hold of him."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, lie entered the well-built house: and <lb/>
            he went straight through the palace to the illustrious suitors <pb n="239"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="326—363."/> <lb/>
            But the fate of black death laid hold of Argus immediately <lb/>
            when he saw Ulysses in the twentieth year. But godlike <lb/>
            Telemachus much the first beheld the swineherd coming to <lb/>
            the house : and then he quickly nodded calling [him] to him: <lb/>
            but he looking about took a seat that lay there, where the <lb/>
            carver sat, distributing much meat to the suitors, who were <lb/>
            feasting in the palace. Taking it, he set it down at the table <lb/>
            of Telemachus opposite to him: and there he himself sat <lb/>
            down : and the herald, taking a share, gave it to him, and <lb/>
            lifted bread out of the basket. And Ulysses entered the <lb/>
            house soon after him, like unto a poor beggar and an aged <lb/>
            man, leaning upon a staff: and sad garments were put around <lb/>
            his body: and he sat down on the ashen threshold within the <lb/>
            doors, leaning against a pillar of cypress wood, which formerly <lb/>
            an artificer had polished skilfully, and had straightened accord­ <lb/>
            ing to a plumb-line.17 But Telemachus, calling the swineherd <lb/>
            to him, addressed him, taking also a whole loaf from the beau­ <lb/>
            tiful basket, and meat, as much as his hands were extended <lb/>
            when he put them round it:</p>
          <p>" Give these to the stranger, bearing [them to him] : and <lb/>
            order him to beg, going about to all the suitors ; shame is not <lb/>
            good for a beggar in need."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but the swineherd went, when he heard <lb/>
            what was said, and standing near addressed to him winged <lb/>
            words : " O stranger, Telemachus gives thee this, and orders <lb/>
            thee to beg, going about to all the suitors: and he says that <lb/>
            shame is not good for a beggar."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " O king Jove, that Telemachus may be happy amongst <lb/>
            men, and may all things succeed for him, whatever he medi­ <lb/>
            tates in his mind."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and received it in both [his hands], and laid it <lb/>
            down there, before his feet, on his unseemly satchel. And he <lb/>
            eat while the bard was singing in the palace ; but when he had <lb/>
            done feasting, the divine bard ceased. And the suitors made <lb/>
            a clamour in the palace; but Minerva, standing near, incited <lb/>
            Ulysses, the son of Laertes, that he might collect meal-cakes <lb/>
            amongst the suitors, and that he might know who were just, <lb/>
            and who lawless. But not even thus was she about to free <note type="footnote"> 17 Hesycli. <foreign xml:lang="grc">στάθμη, σπάρτος, ἐν</foreign> y <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπορθου̃σιν</foreign> oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέκτονες</foreign>, See also <lb/>

            any one from evil.18 And he set out on the right hand to <lb/>
            be- of every man, stretching out his hand every where, as if <lb/>
            lie were a beggar of old. But they, pitying him, bestowed on <lb/>
            him, and were astonished at him; and asked of one another, <lb/>
            who he was, and whence he came. But them Melanthius, <lb/>
            the goatherd, [thus] addressed :</p>
          <p>" Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious queen, with regard <lb/>
            to this stranger: for I have seen him before. The swineherd <lb/>
            forsooth brought him hither; but I do not clearly know him, <lb/>
            from whence lie boasts his race to be."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but Antinous rebuked the swineherd with <lb/>
            words: " O notorious swineherd, why didst thou bring him <lb/>
            to the city? have we not enough of wanderers, and other <lb/>
            sordid beggars, the destroyers of banquets? dost thou profit <lb/>
            at all, that assembled here they consume the property of thy <lb/>
            master? and from whence didst thou invite him?"</p>
          <p>But him thou didst address in answer, O swineherd Eu­ <lb/>
            mæcus : " O Antinous, although thou art good, thou dost not <lb/>
            speak honourable things: for who, when he himself comes <lb/>
            from elsewhere, invites another stranger, except [one] of <lb/>
            those, who are public officers ? a prophet, or curer of ills, or <lb/>
            carpenter of planks, or even a divine bard, who may delight <lb/>
            them, singing ? for these mortals over the boundless earth are <lb/>
            invited:19 no one would invite a beggar, who will devour him <lb/>
            himself. But thou art always, above all the suitors, severe to <lb/>
            the servants of Ulysses, and especially to me ; but I care not, <lb/>
            so long as prudent Penelope and godlike Telemachus live in <lb/>
            the palace."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : Be silent, <lb/>
            do not answer him much with words. But Antinous is evei <lb/>
            accustomed to contend evilly with bitter words, and he en­ <lb/>
            courages others also."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and to Antinous addressed winged words: " O <lb/>
            Antinous, thou takest good care of me, as a father of his son, <lb/>
            thou who commandest me to send a stranger from the palace <lb/>
            by a violent speech ; may not the deity bring this to pass. <lb/>
            Take and give to him: I grudge it not: for I advise it. Nor <lb/>
            in this regard my mother, nor any other of the servants, who <lb/>
            are in the house of divine Ulysses. But thou hast no such <note type="footnote"> " i. e. from the death that awaited them. </note><note type="footnote"> 19 i. e. welcome. Cf. Plato, Sympos. p. 115, G. </note> <pb n="241"/>

            thought in thy breast; for thou desirest thyself to eat, much <lb/>
            rather than to give to another."</p>
          <p>But him Antinous addressed in answer: " Telemachus, <lb/>
            thou lofty speaker, intolerable in might, what hast thou said ? <lb/>
            if all the suitors were to bestow so much on him, the house <lb/>
            would keep him at a distance even for three months."20</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and taking a footstool lying under the table, <lb/>
            he showed it. upon which he placed his soft feet, when ban­ <lb/>
            queting. But all the others gave [to him], and tilled his <lb/>
            satchel with bread and meat: and Ulysses, again going to the <lb/>
            threshold, was now about to taste the bounty of the Greeks; <lb/>
            but he stood near Antinous, and addressed discourse to him:</p>
          <p>" Give, O friend ; thou dost not appear to me to be the <lb/>
            worst of the Grecians, but the best, since thou art like unto a <lb/>
            king : therefore it behoves thee to give something better than <lb/>
            the others, [ something better] than bread: and I would cele­ <lb/>
            brate thee over the boundless earth. For I also once happy <lb/>
            inhabited an opulent house amongst men, and oftentimes gave <lb/>
            to such a wanderer, whatever kind of man he might be, and <lb/>
            whatever he came in need of. And I had great numbers of <lb/>
            servants, and other things, by which men live well, and are <lb/>
            called opulent : but Jove, the son of Saturn, was my ruin, (for <lb/>
            he somehow willed it,) who sent me with much-wandering <lb/>
            robbers to go to Egypt, a long journey, that I might perish : <lb/>
            but I stationed in the river Egyptus the ships rowed on both <lb/>
            sides. Then indeed I bade my beloved companions remain <lb/>
            there near the ships, and draw up the ships ; and I urged <lb/>
            watches to go to places of looking out. But they, yielding to <lb/>
            insolence, and drawn on by their own spirit, very quickly laid <lb/>
            waste the most beautiful fields of the Egyptians, and took <lb/>
            away their wives, and infant children, and slew them : but an <lb/>
            alarm soon reached the city ; and they, hearing the clamour <lb/>
            came together with the shining morn; and the whole plain <lb/>
            was filled with foot and horse, and the glittering of brass : <lb/>
            but thunder-rejoicing Jove infused evil panic into my com­ <lb/>
            panions ; nor did any one dare to remain opposed to them ; <lb/>
            for evils stood around them on every side. There they slew <lb/>
            many of us with the sharp brass, and led some away alive, to <note type="footnote"> 20 i. e. he would get such a beating, that he would be afraid to come <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="443—480."/> <lb/>
            work for them by necessity. But me they gave to a stranger <lb/>
            who met them [to take to] Cyprus, Demetor, son of lasus,. <lb/>
            who reigned by his might over Cyprus. From thence I am <lb/>
            now come hither to this place, suffering harm."</p>
          <p>But him Antinous answered and addressed in turn : " What <lb/>
            deity brought this pest to [us], a trouble of our feast? Stand <lb/>
            out, then, in the middle far off from my table, lest soon thou <lb/>
            shouldst reach a bitter Egypt and Cyprus: since thou art <lb/>
            some daring and shameless beggar. Thou standest near all <lb/>
            in their turn ; but they foolishly give to thee: since there is <lb/>
            no restraint, nor commiseration to give of another's property, <lb/>
            since each has much.</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses, on retiring, addressed : <lb/>
            " Alas ! thou hast not a mind in addition to thy beauty of <lb/>
            form: thou wouldst not give even a grain of salt from thine <lb/>
            house to thine own suppliant, thou, who now sitting down at <lb/>
            another man's [table], hast not had the heart to give some bread <lb/>
            to me, taking it away: but thou hast much before thee."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but Antinous was still more wrathful at <lb/>
            heart, and looking sternly upon him, he addressed to him <lb/>
            winged words : " Now indeed I no longer think that thou wilt <lb/>
            retire well through out of the palace, since thou now speakest <lb/>
            reproachful things."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke: and taking a footstool, he struck his <lb/>
            (Ulysses') right shoulder at the bottom, on the back: but he <lb/>
            stood firm, as a rock ; nor did the weapon of Antinous cause <lb/>
            him to stumble, but in silence he moved his head, deeply de­ <lb/>
            vising ovils ; and going back to the threshold, he sat down, and <lb/>
            put down his well-filled satchel; and addressed the suitors:</p>
          <p>" Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious queen, whilst I <lb/>
            speak the things which the mind in my breast commands me. <lb/>
            There is no sorrow in one's mind, nor grief at all, when a man <lb/>
            fighting for his own possessions is stricken, either for his oxen, <lb/>
            or white sheep : but Antinous struck me on account of my sad <lb/>
            belly, pernicious, which gives many evils to men. But if <lb/>
            there are any where gods and Erinnyes of poor men, may the <lb/>
            and of death reach him before his marriage."</p>
          <p>But him Antinous, son of Eupithes, addressed in turn : " Eat <lb/>
            quiet, O stranger, sitting down, or go away elsewhere; lest <lb/>
            young men drag thee through the house (such things thou speak­ <lb/>
            est !) either by the foot, or by the hand, and flay thee entirely.' <pb n="243"/>
             </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="481—522."/>
          <p>Thus he spoke: but they were all excessively indignant; <lb/>
            and thus some one of the proud youths spoke: " Antinous, not <lb/>
            well didst thou hurl at the wretched wanderer, O thou doomed <lb/>
            to destruction, if there is any god in heaven. For the gods, like <lb/>
            unto foreign strangers, being [seen] in all forms, go about <lb/>
            cities, looking into the insolence and the good conduct of men."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke the suitors, but he heeded not their words. And <lb/>
            Telemachus cherished great grief in his heart for him that <lb/>
            was stricken, nor did he shed a tear from his eye-lids on the <lb/>
            ground, but he moved his head in silence, deeply devising evils.</p>
          <p>When then prudent Penolope heard of him that was stricken <lb/>
            in the palace, she spoke to her handmaidens : " So may bow­ <lb/>
            renowned Apollo strike thee thyself." But her the house­ <lb/>
            keeper Eurynome addressed in turn :</p>
          <p>" Ay, if an end were made to our prayers, no one of these <lb/>
            would reach the beautiful-throned morn."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Penelope addressed in turn : "Nurse, they <lb/>
            are all hateful, since they contrive evils: but Antinous is <lb/>
            especially like unto black Fate. Some unhappy stranger is <lb/>
            wandering through the house, asking alms of the men ; (for <lb/>
            need ordered him ;) there all the others filled [his satchel] <lb/>
            and gave to him ; but he21 with a footstool struck his right <lb/>
            shoulder at the bottom."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke amongst her women servants, sitting in the <lb/>
            chamber; but divine Ulysses feasted: and she having called <lb/>
            the divine swineherd to her, addressed him:</p>
          <p>" Come, O divine Eumæus, going desire the stranger to come, <lb/>
            that I may converse somewhat with him, and inquire, whether <lb/>
            he has either heard of patient Ulysses, or beheld him with his <lb/>
            eyes: for he is like unto one who has wandered much."</p>
          <p>But her thou didst address in answer, O swineherd Eumæus : <lb/>
            " If indeed, O queen, the Grecians would be silent, such things <lb/>
            as he relates would soothe thy dear heart. For I had him for <lb/>
            three nights, and detained him three days in my lodge ; (for he <lb/>
            fame to me first, having escaped from the ship;) but he has <lb/>
            not yet finished relating his misfortunes. And as when a man <lb/>
            looks upon a bard, who from the gods skilfully sings verses <lb/>
            delightful to mortals, and they desire to hear his voice with­ <lb/>
            out ceasing, when he sings; so he, sitting near me in my <lb/>
            house, soothed me. And he says that he is an ancestral friend <note type="footnote"> 31 i. e. Antinous. </note> <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <pb n="244"/>

            of Ulysses, dwelling in Crete, where is the race of Minos, <lb/>
            lie now indeed came hither from thence, suffering harm, roll­ <lb/>
            ing onwards from place to place ;22 and he persists in (saying) <lb/>
            that lie heard of Ulysses being alive, in a rich people near the <lb/>
            Thesprotians ; and he brings many treasures home."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn : " Come, call <lb/>
            him hither, that he himself may speak in my presence. But <lb/>
            let these, either sitting at the doors, or here in the house, de­ <lb/>
            light themselves ; since their mind is glad. For their pos­ <lb/>
            sessions lie uninjured in their houses, bread and sweet wine, <lb/>
            these their servants eat: but they, frequenting our house all <lb/>
            their days, sacrificing oxen and sheep, and fat goats, are feast­ <lb/>
            ing and drinking dark wine vainly: and many things are con­ <lb/>
            sumed ; for there is no man present, such as Ulysses was, to <lb/>
            ward off hostility from the house. But if Ulysses should <lb/>
            come and reach his paternal land, soon would he with his son <lb/>
            be revenged upon the violence of men."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke, but Telemachus sneezed loudly, and the <lb/>
            house resounded violently around : but Penelope laughed, and <lb/>
            quickly to Eumæus addressed winged words :</p>
          <p>" Come, call the stranger hither to my presence. Dost thou <lb/>
            not see, that my son has sneezed to all my words? Therefore <lb/>
            may there be no imperfect death to all the suitors, nor may <lb/>
            any one escape death and the Fates. But I tell thee some­ <lb/>
            thing else, and do thou lay it up in thy mind, if I know that <lb/>
            he speaks all things true, I will put a cloak on him, and a <lb/>
            tunic, beautiful garments."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke ; and the swineherd went, when he heard <lb/>
            her discourse: and standing near him, addressed winged <lb/>
            words:</p>
          <p>" O father stranger, prudent Penelope, the mother of Te­ <lb/>
            lemachus, calls thee; her mind exhorts her to make some in­ <lb/>
            quiries concerning her husband, although she sutlers griefs. <lb/>
            But if she knows that thou spenkest all things true, she will <lb/>
            put a cloak on thee, and a tunic, of which thou art most in <lb/>
            need; and begging bread throughout the people, thou wilt <lb/>
            feed thy belly ; and whoever chooses will give to thee."</p>
          <p>But him much-enduring divine Ulysses addressed in turn: <lb/>
            " O Eumæus, soon will I tell all things true to prudent Pe­ <lb/>
            pelope, daughter of Icarus. For I know well concerning him, <note type="footnote"> <unclear>2</unclear> Sec Scholiast. </note> <pb n="245"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="594—601."/> <lb/>
            and we have undergone the same toil. But I dread the crowd <lb/>
            of cruel suitors, whose insolence and violence readies the steely <lb/>
            heaven. For even now when this man striking me, as I was <lb/>
            going through the house, when I had done no harm, gave me <lb/>
            pain, neither did Telemachus nor any other ward off this. <lb/>
            Now therefore desire Penelope to remain in the palace, al­ <lb/>
            though anxious, until sun-set: and then let her ask me con­ <lb/>
            cerning the return of her husband, having made me sit down <lb/>
            nearer before the fire ; for I have had sad garments ; and thou <lb/>
            thyself knowest it, since I first entreated thee."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke. And the swineherd went, when he heard <lb/>
            his discourse, and Penelope addressed him as he was going <lb/>
            over the threshold:</p>
          <p>" Dost thou not bring him, O Eumæus ? what is this the <lb/>
            wanderer has thought of ? whether fearing any one greatly ? <lb/>
            or in any other way has he awe in the palace ? but bad is a <lb/>
            modest beggar."</p>
          <p>But her thou didst address in answer, O swineherd Eu­ <lb/>
            mæus: " He speaks rightly, as another also would think, <lb/>
            shunning the insolence of haughty men. But he desires thee <lb/>
            to wait until sun-set. And thus it is much better for thyself, <lb/>
            O queen, to speak to the stranger alone, and to listen to him."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn : " The <lb/>
            stranger does not appear to be foolish, whoever he may be: <lb/>
            for not any where do any men among mortal men thus insolent <lb/>
            contrive infatuate deeds."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke; and the divine swineherd went to the <lb/>
            crowd of suitors, when he had informed [her of] all things. <lb/>
            And he immediately to Telemachus addressed winged words, <lb/>
            holding his head near him, that the others might not hear:</p>
          <p>" O friend, I am going away, to guard the swine and other <lb/>
            things, yours and my livelihood : but let all things here be thy <lb/>
            care. First preserve thyself, and consider in thy mind, that <lb/>
            thou dost not suffer any thing : for many of the Grecians devise <lb/>
            evil things ; whom may Jove destroy, before harm befall us."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " So shall <lb/>
            it be, father; but do thou go when thou hast spent the after­ <lb/>
            noon here; 23 but in the morning come, and bring beautiful <lb/>
            sacrifices, but all these things shall be a care to me and the <lb/>

          <p>Thus he spoke; and he sat down again on a well-polished <lb/>
            seat, and having satiated his mind with eating and drinking, <lb/>
            he went to the swine: and lie left the enclosures and the pa­ <lb/>

          <p>While Ulysses is begging among the suitors, another beggar named Irus <lb/>
            eomes ; they fight, and the latter is conquered by a single blow. Having <lb/>
            cast out Irus, Ulysses threatens Amphinomus with vengeance, asserting <lb/>
            that the king will shortly appear. Penelope comes to the suitors, and <lb/>
            reminds them of the presents she ought to receive froin each ; and they <lb/>
            accordingly send their servants for presents. Eurymaehus casts a stool at <lb/>
            Ulysses, which hits the cup-bearer; a confusion ensues, and the suitors <lb/>
            depart to their own dwellings.</p>
          <p>AND there also' came a public beggar, who begged through <lb/>
            the city of Ithaci, and he surpassed others2 in his raving <lb/>
            belly, to eat and drink without ceasing:3 nor had he might <lb/>
            or force ; but he was very large in form to behold. And Ar­ <lb/>
            næus was his name ; for this his venerable mother gave him <lb/>
            from his birth : but all the young men called him Irus, be­ <lb/>
            cause he went as a messenger,4 whenever any one ordered <lb/>
            him any where. Who coming wished to drive Ulysses from <lb/>
            his own house, and chiding him, he spoke winged words :</p>
          <p>"Go, old man, from the portico, lest thou soon be drawn <lb/>
            by the foot: dost not thou perceive that all are winking at me, <lb/>
            and desire me to drag thee out ? but I however am ashamed. <lb/>
            But rise, lest soon between us there be contention even with <lb/>
            our hands."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses regarding, sternly ad­ <lb/>
            dressed: "Sirrah, I neither do nor speak any evil to thee, <lb/>
            nor do I grudge that any one should give to thee, although <note type="footnote"> 24 See Buttm. ibid. </note><note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ</foreign> = besides Ulysses. </note><note type="footnote"> * The notion of " others " is implied in <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετά</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> ' Hesyeh. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀζηχὲς, δφηνεκές, ἀιάλειπτον</foreign>.

            thou receives! much. This threshold will contain us both; <lb/>
            nor is it fit that thou shouldst grudge what belongs to others: <lb/>
            but thou seemest to me to be a wanderer, even as I; but the <lb/>
            gods have the power to bestow wealth.5 But do not challenge <lb/>
            me too much to [strife of] of hands, lest thou shouldst make <lb/>
            me wroth, lest, although being aged, I shall defile thy breast <lb/>
            and lips with blood ; and to-morrow there would be still more <lb/>
            quiet for me: for I do not at all think that thou wilt return <lb/>
            a second time to the house of Ulysses, son of Laertes."</p>
          <p>But him the wanderer Irus enraged addressed: " O gods ! <lb/>
            how glibly this gluttonous fellow harangues, like unto an <lb/>
            old woman covered with soot ;6 against whom I would devise <lb/>
            evil, smiting him with both [hands], and would drive all the <lb/>
            teeth out of his jaws upon the ground, as of a swine that eats <lb/>
            the wheat in the field. Now gird thyself, that all these may <lb/>
            behold us fighting; but how wouldst thou contend with a <lb/>
            younger man ?"</p>
          <p>Thus they before the lofty gates on the polished threshold <lb/>
            were irritated [each other] with all their mind. And the <lb/>
            sacred might of Antinous set them twain together, and laugh­ <lb/>
            ing out pleasantly, he addressed the suitors :</p>
          <p>"0 friends, such a thing has never before been done: <lb/>
            what a delight has the deity brought to this house! The <lb/>
            stranger and Irus are contending with one another, so as to <lb/>
            come to blows with their hands ; and we will soon set them <lb/>
            together."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and they all rose up laughing ; and they <lb/>
            formed a ring round the ill-clad beggars. And them Antinous, <lb/>
            son of Eupithes, addressed:</p>
          <p>" Hear me, noble suitors, whilst I say something. These <lb/>
            paunches of goats are cooking on the fire; and having filled <lb/>
            them with fat and blood, we lay them aside for supper: but <lb/>
            whichever conquers, and is the superior, let him, rising up <lb/>
            take whichever of them he chooses; and afterwards he shall <lb/>
            always feast amongst us, nor will we suffer any other beggar <lb/>
            to come amongst us to ask alms." <note type="footnote"> 5 This seems the best way of expressing <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλλουσιν ὀπάζειν</foreign>. Mr <lb/>

          <p>Thus spoke Antinous; and his discourse pleased them. <lb/>
            But them much-planning Ulysses, thinking cunningly, ad­ <lb/>
            dressed :</p>
          <p>" O friends, it is not possible for an old man, spent with <lb/>
            toil, to fight with a younger man ; but my ill-working belly <lb/>
            excites me, that I should be subdued by blows. But come <lb/>
            now, all of you swear a strong oath to me, that no one grati­ <lb/>
            fying Irus will wickedly strike me with his stout hand, and <lb/>
            violently subdue me for him."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and they all swore that they would not [do <lb/>
            so], as he desired them. But when they had sworn, and had <lb/>
            concluded the oath, them the sacred might of Telemachus <lb/>
            addressed in turn:</p>
          <p>" O stranger, if thy heart and noble mind incites thee to <lb/>
            drive him out, do not fear any one else of the Grecians: since <lb/>
            whoever strikes thee will contend with greater numbers. I <lb/>
            am the host, and the kings Eurymachus and Antinous, both <lb/>
            prudent men, agree with me."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and they all approved: but Ulysses girded <lb/>
            his middle around with rags, and showed his beautiful and <lb/>
            large thighs; and his broad shoulders, and breast, and strong <lb/>
            arms appeared : but Minerva, standing near him, increased <lb/>
            the limbs of the shepherd of the people. And all the suitors <lb/>
            were excessively astonished, and thus some one said, looking <lb/>
            to another near him :</p>
          <p>" Soon indeed will Imus, unhappily so called,7 have evil <lb/>
            drawn on himself, such a thigh does the old man show from <lb/>
            out his rags."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke; but the mind of Irus was sadly moved, <lb/>
            but even so the attendants, having girded him, brought him by <lb/>
            force, although afraid: and his flesh trembled on his limbs. <lb/>
            But Antinous chided him, and spoke and said :</p>
          <p>" Now, O mighty boaster,8 mayest thou no longer live, or <lb/>
            exist, if indeed thou tremblest at and greatly fearest this old <lb/>
            man, overcome with the toil which comes upon him. But I <lb/>
            tell thee plainly, and this shall be accomplished ; if he con­ <lb/>
            quers thee. and is superior to thee, I will send thee to Epirus, <note type="footnote"> ' Literally. " Irus no-Irus." </note><note type="footnote"> A From <foreign xml:lang="grc">βου̃ς</foreign> = great, large, (see note on Æsch. Ag. p. 96, n. 7, cel. <lb/>

          <p>Thus he spoke: but trembling still more seized upon his <lb/>
            limbs : and they brought him into a middle spot, and both held <lb/>
            up their hands. Then much-enduring divine Ulysses medi­ <lb/>
            tated, whether he should strike him so that life should leave <lb/>
            him falling there ; or should strike him lightly, and prostrate <lb/>
            him on the earth. And thus to him considering it seemed to <lb/>
            be better to strike him lightly, that the Grecians might not <lb/>
            have any notion of him.9 Then both uplifting [their hands], <lb/>
            Irus struck him on his right shoulder ; but he struck his neck <lb/>
            under the ear, and broke his bones within: and the purple <lb/>
            blood immediately came through his mouth, and lie fell <lb/>
            stretched in the dust groaning, and gnashed his teeth together, <lb/>
            kicking the earth with his feet: but the noble suitors lifting <lb/>
            up their hands were ready to die with laughter: but Ulysses, <lb/>
            taking him by the foot, dragged him through out of the <lb/>
            portico, until he reached the court and the doors of the por­ <lb/>
            tico ; and he set him down, reclining him against the fence of <lb/>
            the court; and he put his staff in his hand, and addressing <lb/>
            him, spoke winged words :</p>
          <p>" Sit now here, and keep off the dogs and swine ; nor do <lb/>
            thou, being a pitiful wretch, be the prince of strangers and be-­ <lb/>
            gars, lest by chance thou shouldst reap some even greater evil."</p>
          <p>He spoke; and threw his unseemly satchel around his <lb/>
            shoulders, very tattered ; and there was a twisted cord to hold <lb/>
            it.10 And going back to the threshold, he sat down ; but they <lb/>
            went within laughing pleasantly, and greeted him with words:</p>
          <p>" May Jove and the other immortal gods grant thee, O <lb/>
            stranger, whatever thou most desirest, and is dear to thy <lb/>
            mind, thou, who hast made this insatiable fellow cease to <lb/>
            beg amongst the people ; for we will soon take him over to <lb/>
            Epirus, to king Echetus, the injurer of all mortals."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke ; but divine Ulysses rejoiced in the omen ; <lb/>
            and Antinous placed a large paunch near him, full of fat and <lb/>
            blood ; and Amphinomus, taking two loaves out of a basket, <lb/>
            placed them near him, and pledged him with a golden cup <lb/>
            and spoke: <note type="footnote"> 9 i. c. guess who he really was </note><note type="footnote">10 See on xvii. 199 </note> <pb n="250"/>

          <p>" Hail, father stranger! may there be happiness for thee <lb/>
            hereafter, but now thou art possessed by many ills."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " O Amphinomus, thou seemest to me to be very prudent: <lb/>
            for [thou art] of such a sire: since I have heard his excellent <lb/>
            renown, that he is Dulichian Nisus, both brave and opulent: <lb/>
            from him they say that thou art born ; but thou art like unto <lb/>
            an eloquent man. Therefore I tell thee; and do thou con­ <lb/>
            sider it, and listen to me. The earth nourishes nothing <lb/>
            weaker than man, of all the things, whatever breathe and <lb/>
            creep upon the earth. For he says that he shall never suffer <lb/>
            any ill hereafter, while the gods give him excellence, and his <lb/>
            knees move ; but when the blessed gods bring to pass grievous <lb/>
            things also, then he bears them too, unwillingly, with a suf­ <lb/>
            fering mind. For such is the mind of men upon the earth, <lb/>
            as is the day which the father of men and of gods brings on.11 <lb/>
            For I once was prosperous amongst men, and did many infa­ <lb/>
            tuate things, yielding to violence and strength, trusting in <lb/>
            my father and my brothers. Therefore let not any man be <lb/>
            at all lawless, but let him in silence keep the gifts of the <lb/>
            gods, whatever they give him. What impious things I per­ <lb/>
            ceive the suitors devising, wasting the possessions and dis­ <lb/>
            honouring the wife of a man, whom I do not think will be <lb/>
            long absent from his friends and his paternal land; but [he <lb/>
            is] very near ! yet may the deity take thee out away homeward <lb/>
            in secret, nor mayest thou meet him, when he returns to his <lb/>
            dear paternal land ; for I do not think that the suitors and he <lb/>
            will separate without blood, when he comes under the roof."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and having poured out a libation, he drank <lb/>
            sweet wine: and again he placed the cup in the hands of the <lb/>
            leader of the people. But he went through the house, griev­ <lb/>
            ing in his dear heart, nodding with his head: for his mind <lb/>
            already foreboded. But not thus did he escape Fate; for <lb/>
            Minerva bound him, so that he should be bravely overcome <lb/>
            by the hand and spear of Telemachus. And he sat down <lb/>
            again on the throne from whence he rose. But the blue- <note type="footnote"> 11 Thus translated by Cicero apud August, de Civ. Dei, v. 8: <lb/>

            eyed goddess Minerva put it in the mind of the daughter of <lb/>
            Icarus, prudent Penelope, to appear to the suitors, that as <lb/>
            much as possible she might lay open the mind of the suitors, <lb/>
            and be more honoured by her husband and son, than she <lb/>
            was before. And she laughed feignedly, and spoke and <lb/>
            said :</p>
          <p>" Eurynome, my mind desires, though [it did not] before, <lb/>
            to appear to the suitors, however detested. But I would speak <lb/>
            a word to my son, which would be better, not altogether to <lb/>
            associate with the overbearing suitors, who speak well indeed, <lb/>
            but intend evilly afterwards."</p>
          <p>But her the housekeeper Eurynome addressed in turn : " Of <lb/>
            a truth indeed, my child, thou hast spoken all these things <lb/>
            rightly ; but go, and tell thy son, nor conceal it, having <lb/>
            washed thy body and anointed thy cheeks. Do not go thus, <lb/>
            defiled as to thy face with tears; since it is worse to grieve <lb/>
            for ever without ceasing. For now thy son is of such an age, <lb/>
            as thou especially didst pray to the immortals, when he was <lb/>
            born, that thou shouldst see him with a beard."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Penelope addressed in turn: "0 Eury­ <lb/>
            nome, do not advise me this, although anxious for me, to wash <lb/>
            my body and anoint myself with oil: for the gods who possess <lb/>
            Olympus, have destroyed my beauty, since he departed in his <lb/>
            hollow ships. But command Autonoe and Hippodamia to <lb/>
            come to me, that they may stand near me in the palace, for I <lb/>
            will not go alone amongst men ; for I am ashamed."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke; and the old woman went through out of <lb/>
            the palace, to bear word to the women, and to urge them to <lb/>
            return. Then the blue-eyed goddess Minerva meditated <lb/>
            something else; she shed sweet sleep upon the daughter of <lb/>
            Icarus, and lying down she slumbered, and all her limbs were <lb/>
            loosed there in the conch : in the mean time the divine one of <lb/>
            goddesses gave her immortal gifts, that the Grecians might <lb/>
            admire her: first she anointed her beauteous face with am­ <lb/>
            brosial loveliness, such as that with which beautiful-crowned <lb/>
            Venus is anointed, when she goes to the delightful chorus <lb/>
            of the Graces. And she made her taller and larger to look <lb/>
            upon : and she made her whiter than sawn ivory. The divine <lb/>
            one of goddesses thus having done, departed. And the white- <lb/>
            armed handmaidens came from the palace, talking as they <pb n="252"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="198-235"/> <lb/>
            came:12 but sweet sleep left her. and she wiped her cheeks <lb/>
            with her hands, and spoke:</p>
          <p>" Truly a very soft slumber has covered me who suffer <lb/>
            grievous things; would that chaste Diana would now imme­ <lb/>
            diately give me as soft a death, that no longer lamenting in <lb/>
            my mind, I might waste away my life, regretting the various <lb/>
            excellence of a dear husband: since he was conspicuous among <lb/>
            the Grecians."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, she descended from the splendid 13 <lb/>
            upper-rooms, not alone: [for] two handmaidens followed with <lb/>
            her. But when the divine one of women reached the suitors, <lb/>
            site stood near the pillar of the strong-made roof, holding up <lb/>
            a slender veil before her cheeks: and a prudent handmaiden <lb/>
            stood on each side of her. And their knees were loosed, and <lb/>
            their minds were soothed with love: and all desired to lie <lb/>
            near her on her couch.</p>
          <p>But she then addressed her dear son Telemachus: "0 <lb/>
            Telemachus, no longer is thy mind firm, nor thy counsel: <lb/>
            when thou wert still a child, thou didst even more meditate <lb/>
            what was profitable in thy mind: but now, when thou art <lb/>
            large, and hast reached the measure of youth, and a foreign <lb/>
            man would say, that thou art the offspring of a happy man, <lb/>
            looking at thy size and beauty; thy mind and thy counsel are <lb/>
            no longer proper. What a deed is this which has now been <lb/>
            done in the palace, thou who hast suffered a stranger to be <lb/>
            treated thus in an unseemly way? How now ? if any stranger <lb/>
            sitting in our house, thus suffer from terrible violence, it <lb/>
            would be a shame and disgrace to thee amongst men."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Telemachus addressed in answer: " My <lb/>
            mother, I am not indignant that thou shouldst be angry; but <lb/>
            I consider and know every thing in my mind, both what is <lb/>
            good and what is worse : (but before I was still a babe :) but I <lb/>
            cannot perceive all things that are prudent; for these astound <lb/>
            me, meditating evils, sitting one with another; and I have no <lb/>
            assistants. The conflict however between the stranger and <lb/>
            Irus was not made by the will of the suitors; but he was <lb/>
            superior in strength. Would that, O father Jove, and Mi­ <lb/>
            lIen'a, and Apollo, the suitors may now thus nod their heads, <note type="footnote"> 12 Literally, " coming with talking." </note><note type="footnote">13 See note on xvi. 445 </note> <pb n="253"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="236—280"/> <lb/>
            overcome in our palace, some in the court, and some within <lb/>
            the house, and the limbs of each were loosed; as now that <lb/>
            Irus sits at the court gates nodding with his head, like unto <lb/>
            a drunken man, nor can he stand upright on his feet, nor re­ <lb/>
            turn home, wherever he has to return: since his limbs are <lb/>
            loosed."</p>
          <p>Thus then they spoke to one another, but Eurymachus <lb/>
            addressed Penelope in words :</p>
          <p>" O prudent Penelope, daughter of Icarus, if all the Gre­ <lb/>
            cians in Iasian Argos should behold thee, more suitors would <lb/>
            feast in thine house in the morning, since thou excellest <lb/>
            women, in form and size, and equal mind within."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope then answered : " O Euryma­ <lb/>
            chus, the immortals indeed destroyed my excellence, and form, <lb/>
            and person, when the Grecians embarked for Troy: and <lb/>
            amongst them was my husband Ulysses. If he should come <lb/>
            and manage my household, so would my fame be greater and <lb/>
            more noble; but now I am grieved, for so many evils has the <lb/>
            deity made to rush upon me. When indeed he went away, <lb/>
            leaving his paternal land, taking my right hand by the wrist, <lb/>
            he addressed me: ' O lady, I think not that all the well- <lb/>
            greaved Greeks will return from Troy unharmed, for they <lb/>
            say that the Trojans are warriors, both javelin-men, and <lb/>
            drawers of arrows, and mounters on swift-footed steeds, who <lb/>
            would very soon determine the great contest of equal war. <lb/>
            Therefore I know not, whether God will let me return, or <lb/>
            whether I shall be taken there in Troy: but let all things <lb/>
            here be a care to thee. Be mindful of my father and mother <lb/>
            in the palace, as now, or still more, when I am away. But <lb/>
            when thou seest our son with a beard, marry whom thou wilt, <lb/>
            leaving him in thine house.' Thus he spoke; but all these <lb/>
            things are now accomplished. It shall be night when hate­ <lb/>
            ful marriage shall meet with me undone; from whom Jove <lb/>
            has taken away fortune. But this severe grief comes upon <lb/>
            my heart and mind: nor was this the usual custom of suitors <lb/>
            hitherto, who wish to woo a good wife, and the daughter of a <lb/>
            rich man, and contend with each other : they indeed bring <lb/>
            oxen and rich sheep, as a feast for the friends of the damsel, <lb/>
            and give glorious gifts; but do not consume the livelihood of <lb/>
            others with impunity."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke ; and much-enduring: divine Ulysses re- <pb n="254"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="281-320."/> <lb/>
            joiced, because she drew gifts from them, and soothed their <lb/>
            mind with mild words ; but his thoughts meditated other <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>But her Antinous, son of Eupithes, addressed in turn : " O <lb/>
            prudent Penelope, daughter of Icarus, receive gifts from <lb/>
            whoever of the Greeks chooses to bring them hither; for it is <lb/>
            not-well to refuse a present. But we will neither go to our <lb/>
            employments, or any where else, before thou art wedded to <lb/>
            whoever is the best of the Grecians."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Antinous, and his discourse pleased them : and <lb/>
            each sent a herald to bring presents. For Antinous indeed, <lb/>
            he brought a large, beautiful, variegated robe; and there <lb/>
            were twelve golden clasps in all upon it, fitted with well-bent <lb/>
            eyes.15 And for Eurymachus, he immediately brought a much- <lb/>
            variegated necklace of gold set with amber, like as the sun. <lb/>
            And two servants brought ear-rings for Eurydamus, set with <lb/>
            triple eye-like drops, beautifully wrought, and much beauty <lb/>
            shone from them. And the servants of Pisander, the king, son <lb/>
            of Polyctor, brought a collar, a very beautiful ornament. And <lb/>
            different of the Grecians brought different handsome gifts. <lb/>
            The divine one of women then ascended to the upper rooms; <lb/>
            and with her the handmaidens carried the very beautiful pre­ <lb/>
            sents. But they turning themselves to the dance and lovely <lb/>
            song were delighted; and they remained until evening came: <lb/>
            and black evening came over them while being delighted. <lb/>
            Immediately they placed three braziers16 in the palace, that <lb/>
            they might give light: and they put dry wood around, dried <lb/>
            some time ago, very arid, lately cleft with brass: and they <lb/>
            mixed brands with them : and the women-servants of patient <lb/>
            Ulysses lit them up by turns ; but the noble much-planning <lb/>
            Ulysses himself addressed them :</p>
          <p>" Ye women-servants of Ulysses, the long-absent king, go <lb/>
            to the house, where is the venerable queen : and near her turn <lb/>
            the distaff; and sitting in the palace, delight her, or comb the <lb/>
            wool with your hands. But I will give light to all these. <lb/>
            Fur even if they desire to wait till beautiful-throned moin, <lb/>
            they shall not overcome me : for I am able to endure much."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but they laughed, and looked at one an­ <lb/>
            other. But fair-cheeked Melantho chided him shamefully: <note type="footnote"> " It is doubtful whether the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόος</foreign> refers to Penelope or Ulysses. </note><note type="footnote"> u Set; Loewe. </note><note type="footnote">16 <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαμπτη̃ϱας. ἐσχάρας μετιωϱους</foreign>.

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="321-355"/> <lb/>
            her Dolius indeed begot, but Penelope brought her up, and <lb/>
            nurtured her as her own child, and gave her play-things to <lb/>
            delight her mind: but not even thus did she possess the grief <lb/>
            of Penelope in her breast. But she was mingled with Eury­ <lb/>
            machus and loved him; she then chided Ulysses with re­ <lb/>
            proachful words:</p>
          <p>" Wretched stranger, thou art some one stricken out of thy <lb/>
            senses : thou dost not wish to sleep, going to a brazier's house, <lb/>
            or to the public meeting-place ; but here thou [boldly speakest <lb/>
            much amongst many men; nor dost thou fear at all in thy <lb/>
            mind : either wine has laid hold of thine understanding, or <lb/>
            thou hast always such a disposition, thou who utterest vain <lb/>
            words]. Dost thou exult vainly, because thou hast con­ <lb/>
            quered the vagrant Irus ? [Take care], lest some other <lb/>
            better than Irus should soon rise up, who, cutting thee about <lb/>
            the head with his sturdy hands, will send thee out of the <lb/>
            house, besmearing thee with much blood."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses, sternly beholding, ad­ <lb/>
            dressed : " Surely I will soon go thither, impudent one, and <lb/>
            tell Telemachus, what things thou speakest, that he may forth­ <lb/>
            with cut thee up limb by limb."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he terrified 17 the women with his <lb/>
            words: and they went through the house; and the limbs of <lb/>
            each were loosed under them through fear; for they said <lb/>
            [within themselves] that he spoke truly. But he stood look­ <lb/>
            ing upon all, giving light near to the burning hearths: more­ <lb/>
            over his heart meditated in his breast things which were not <lb/>
            to be unaccomplished. But Minerva did not suffer the haughty <lb/>
            suitors altogether to refrain from their mind-paining insolence, <lb/>
            that grief might still more come upon the heart of Ulysses, <lb/>
            son of Laertes. And Eurymachus, son of Polybus, began to <lb/>
            speak to them, scoffing at Ulysses; and he caused laughter <lb/>
            amongst his companions.</p>
          <p>" Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious queen, whilst I <lb/>
            speak the things which the mind in my breast commands me. <lb/>
            This man does not come to the house of Ulysses without the <lb/>
            will of some god: to me however the flame of the torches <lb/>
            seems to be from him, and his head ; since he has no hair, not <lb/>
            even a little."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and at the same time addressed city-destroying <note type="footnote"> 17 Literally, "fluttered." </note> <pb n="256"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="356 - 392."/> <lb/>
            Ulysses : " Stranger, art thou willing to serve, if I would lake <lb/>
            thee, at the extreme part of the country, (but thon shalt have <lb/>
            sufficient pay, ) collecting heapsof stones, and planting tall trees? <lb/>
            There indeed I would supply thee with food for a whole year, <lb/>
            and would put garments on thee, and would give thee sandals <lb/>
            for thy feet. But since indeed thou hast learnt evil works, <lb/>
            thou wilt not be willing to hasten to work; but thou desirest <lb/>
            to beg through the people, until thou hast wherewith to feed <lb/>
            thine insatiable belly."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " Eurymachus, if there were to be a contention of work be­ <lb/>
            tween us in the spring season, when the days are long, in the <lb/>
            grass, and I had a well-bent sickle, and thou also hadst such <lb/>
            a one, that we might make trial of our work, fasting until <lb/>
            dark, and there was grass at hand ; or if again there were <lb/>
            oxen to drive, which are the best, sleek, large, both well fed <lb/>
            with grass, of equal age, bearing equal burdens, whose <lb/>
            strength was not weak, and there was a Held of four acres, <lb/>
            and the glebe yielded to the plough, then thou wouldst see <lb/>
            me, if I would cut through continual furrows. If again the <lb/>
            son of Saturn should to-day raise up war from any place, but <lb/>
            I had a shield and two spears, and a helmet, all brass, fitted <lb/>
            upon my temples ; then thou shouldst see me mixed amongst <lb/>
            the first fore-fighters; nor wouldst thou speak, reproaching <lb/>
            my belly. But thou insultest me very muœch, and thy mind <lb/>
            is cruel; and thou thinkest that thou art some great and <lb/>
            mighty person, because thou dost associate with few, and <lb/>
            those not excellent: but if Ulysses should come and reach his <lb/>
            paternal land, soon the gates, although they are very wide, <lb/>
            would be narrow for thee when flying out of doors through <lb/>
            the portico."</p>
          <p>Thus lie spoke ; but Eurymaehus was more wroth at heart, <lb/>
            and sternly regarding him, he addressed to him winged <lb/>
            words :</p>
          <p>"Ah ! wretched one, surely I will soon accomplish some <lb/>
            evil upon thee, such things dost thou speak boldly amongst <lb/>
            men ; nor dost thou at all fear in thy mind ; wine in truth <lb/>
            has laid hold of thine understanding, or thou hast always such <lb/>
            a disposition, thou who uttered vain words. [Dost thon <lb/>
            exult vainly, because thou hast conquered the wanderer <lb/>
            Irus ?"] <pb n="257"/>
            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="393 -427."/>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he took a stool: but Ulysses sat down <lb/>
            at the knees of Dulichian Amphinomus, fearing Euryniachus : <lb/>
            and lie struck the cup-bearer on his right hand; and the <lb/>
            bowl, falling on the ground, resounded; but he, groaning, fell <lb/>
            supine in the dust. And the suitors made a tumult in the <lb/>
            dark palace ; and thus some one said, looking to another near <lb/>
            him:</p>
          <p>" Would that the stranger, wandering, had perished else­ <lb/>
            where, before he came [here] ; then would he not have caused <lb/>
            so great a tumult. But now we are contending about a <lb/>
            beggar; nor will there be any delight in an excellent ban­ <lb/>
            quet, since the worst things prevail."</p>
          <p>Then the sacred might of Telemachus addressed them: <lb/>
            " Sirs, ye are mad, and no longer eat and drink in quiet: <lb/>
            some one of the gods irritates you. But having feasted well, <lb/>
            go home, and lie down, when your mind commands you; but <lb/>
            I drive no one away." 18</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and they all biting their lips with their <lb/>
            teeth, marvelled at Telemachus for what he boldly spoke. <lb/>
            But Amphinomus, the illustrious son of king Nisus, son of <lb/>
            Aretias, harangued and addressed them :</p>
          <p>" My friends, no one surely attacking [him] with hostile <lb/>
            words, would be angry with what has been spoken justly. <lb/>
            Neither insult the stranger any more, nor any other of the <lb/>
            servants who are In the house of divine Ulysses. But come, <lb/>
            let the cup-bearer make the first offerings with the cups, that <lb/>
            having made libations, we going home may lie down : and let <lb/>
            us leave the stranger in the palace of Ulysses for Telemachus <lb/>
            to take care of: for he has come to his kind house."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and he spoke words pleasing to all of them. <lb/>
            And the hero Mulius, the Dulichian herald, mixed a bowl for <lb/>
            them ; but he was the servant of Amphinomus ; and he dis­ <lb/>
            tributed to all in succession: and they having made libations <lb/>
            to the blessed gods, drank sweet wine. But when they had <lb/>
            made libations, and drunk as much as their mind wished, each <lb/>
            went to his own home to lie down to rest. <note type="footnote"> 16 i. c. go when you choose. </note> <note type="footnote"> 9 </note> <pb n="258"/>

          <p>BOOK XIX.</p>
          <p>ARGUMENT.</p>
          <p>During the night Ulysses and Telemachus remove the arms from the hil' <lb/>
            to an upper chamber. Ulysses then gives a feigned account of himself to <lb/>
            Penelope. Euryclea, while washing his feet, recognises him by a scar or, <lb/>
            his knee ; then follows an account of the way in which he was wounded <lb/>
            by a boar while hunting in Parnassus.</p>
          <p>BUT divine Ulysses was left in the palace, meditating destruc­ <lb/>
            tion for the suitors with Minerva. And he immediately ad­ <lb/>
            dressed to Telemachus winged words :</p>
          <p>" Telemachus, it behoves [thee] to lay up all the warlike <lb/>
            arms within ; but to deceive the suitors with mild words, when <lb/>
            desiring them they inquire of thee ; [saying], I have placed <lb/>
            them out of the smoke ; since they are no longer like unto <lb/>
            those which Ulysses once left, when going to Troy, but are <lb/>
            become soiled, as much as the vapour of fire has reached them. <lb/>
            But the deity has put this still greater matter in my mind, <lb/>
            lest by chance intoxicated, having made a quarrel amongst <lb/>
            you, ye should wound one another, and disgrace the feast, and <lb/>
            the wooing ; for the steel itself draws on a man."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and Telemachus obeyed his dear father: <lb/>
            and calling out the nurse Euryclea, he addressed her:</p>
          <p>" Nurse, come now, shut the women in the palace, whilst I <lb/>
            lay up the beautiful arms of my sire in the chamber, which <lb/>
            the smoke besmears, not taken care of in the house, whilst my <lb/>
            sire is absent: but I was yet a child ; but now I wish to lay <lb/>
            them up, where the vapour of fire will not reach them."</p>
          <p>But him the dear nurse Euryclea addressed in turn: <lb/>
            " Would that, my child, thou wouldst at length assume pru­ <lb/>
            dence to thyself, to take care of thy house, and to guard all <lb/>
            thy possessions. But come, who then going with thee, shall <lb/>
            carry a light ? Thou dost not suffer the handmaidens, who <lb/>
            would have given light, to come forward."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Telemachus answered in turn: " This <lb/>
            stranger [will]: for I will not allow him to be without em­ <lb/>
            ployment, whoever touches my food,1 although having come <lb/>
            from afar." <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χοι̃νιξ</foreign> is properly a measure containing two sextarii; and from thence <lb/>

            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="35—67."/>
          <p>Thus be spoke; but the word was unwinged :2 and she <lb/>
            shut the gates of the well-built palace. But Ulysses and his <lb/>
            glorious son hastening, carried in the helmets, and embossed <lb/>
            shields, and sharp spears: and Pallas Minerva before [them], <lb/>
            holding a golden lamp, gave a very beautiful light. Then <lb/>
            Telemachus quickly addressed his sire:</p>
          <p>" O father, truly I behold this a great marvel with mine <lb/>
            eyes: the walls of the palace, and the beautiful intercolumnia­ <lb/>
            tions,3 and the fir-tree beams, and the lofty columns, shine al­ <lb/>
            together before mine eyes, as with burning fire. Certainly <lb/>
            some god is within, [of those] who possess the wide heaven."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            "Be silent; and restrain thy thoughts, nor make inquiries: <lb/>
            this indeed is the right of the gods who possess Olympus. <lb/>
            But do thou go and lie down; and I will remain here, that I <lb/>
            may still excite the handmaidens and thy mother: but she <lb/>
            mourning will ask me concerning every thing."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and Telemachus went through out of the <lb/>
            palace to his chamber to lie down, (shining under the light of <lb/>
            torches,) where he before lay down, when sweet sleep came <lb/>
            upon him. There indeed he at that time also lay down, and <lb/>
            waited for divine morn. But divine Ulysses was left in the <lb/>
            palace meditating destruction for the suitors, with Minerva. <lb/>
            And prudent Penelope came from her chamber, like unto <lb/>
            Diana, and golden Venus: for her indeed they placed a seat <lb/>
            near the fire, upon which she sat, turned with ivory and <lb/>
            silver ; which formerly the artificer Icmalius wrought, and un­ <lb/>
            der it he put a footstool for the feet, joined to it, upon which <lb/>
            a large fleece was spread. There then prudent Penelope <lb/>
            sat down. And white-armed handmaidens came from the <lb/>
            palace: and they took away much bread, and the tables, and <lb/>
            the cups, from which the over-violent men drank. And they <lb/>
            threw the fire from the hearths upon the ground ; and heaped <lb/>
            up much other wood upon them, to be a light and to give <lb/>
            warmth. And Melantho a second time chided Ulysses:</p>
          <p>" O stranger, still wilt thou trouble us here, ranging through <lb/>
            the house in the night? and wilt thou watch the women? <note type="footnote"> 2 See on xvii. 57. </note><note type="footnote"> a I prefer this interpretation, but the student may take choice among <lb/>

            But depart out of doors, wretched one, and enjoy thy meal: <lb/>
            or soon, ay, stricken with a torch, thou shalt go out of doors."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses, sternly regarding, ad­ <lb/>
            dressed: "Impudent woman, why dost thou thus press upon <lb/>
            me with angered mind ? is it because I am squalid, and am <lb/>
            clothed on my body in bad garments ? and beg through the <lb/>
            people ? for necessity presses upon me. But such are beggars <lb/>
            and wanderers. For I also, once wealthy, inhabited an opulent <lb/>
            house amongst men, and I often gave to such a wanderer, <lb/>
            whoever he might be, and whatever he came wanting. And <lb/>
            I had innumerable servants, and many other things, by which <lb/>
            men live well and are called opulent: but Jove, the son of <lb/>
            Saturn, destroyed me; for he somehow willed [to do so]. <lb/>
            Therefore, woman, [beware] lest thou lose all thy beauty, <lb/>
            with which thou art now adorned amongst the women-serv­ <lb/>
            ants, for fear thy mistress, enraged with thee, should be wroth, <lb/>
            or Ulysses should return : for there is still some share of <lb/>
            hope. But even if he has perished, and is no longer able to <lb/>
            return, yet by the will of Apollo lie has now such a son, Te­ <lb/>
            lemachus ; and no one of the women acting impiously in the <lb/>
            palace will escape him : since he is no longer of such an age."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but prudent Penelope heard him; and she <lb/>
            chided her handmaiden, and spoke, and addressed her:</p>
          <p>"In no wise, O bold, O shameless one, shalt thou escape <lb/>
            me, doing a heinous deed, which thou shalt atone with thine <lb/>
            head. For thou knewest full well, since thou didst hear <lb/>
            from me myself, that I intend to inquire of the stranger in <lb/>
            my palace concerning my husband, since I am continually <lb/>
            grieved."</p>
          <p>She spoke, and addressed the housekeeper, Eurynome: <lb/>
            " O Eurynome, bring a seat and [spread] a skin upon it, that <lb/>
            the stranger sitting down may tell me, and hear from me ; for <lb/>
            I wish to inquire of him."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke; and she very quickly bringing a well- <lb/>
            polished seat, set it down, and spread a skin upon it: there <lb/>
            then much-enduring divine Ulysses sat down. And to them <lb/>
            prudent Penelope began discourse:</p>
          <p>" O stranger, I myself will first ask of thee, who art thou ? <lb/>
            from whence art thou amongst men ? where are thy city and <lb/>
            parents ? "</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <pb n="261"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="107—147."/> <lb/>
            " O lady, no one of mortals over the boundless earth would <lb/>
            find fault with thee; for thy fame reaches the wide heaven, <lb/>
            as of some blameless king, who, godlike, ruling over many <lb/>
            and mighty men, upholds equity : and the dark earth produces <lb/>
            wheat and barley, and the trees are heavy laden with fruit; <lb/>
            and it brings forth strong sheep, and the sea furnishes fish on <lb/>
            account of his good government; and the people are virtuous <lb/>
            under him. Now therefore inquire of me the other things <lb/>
            in thine house: but do not ask my race and paternal land, <lb/>
            lest thou shouldst the more fill my mind with pains, as I call <lb/>
            things to my recollection: but I am a man of much grief; <lb/>
            nor is it at all fit that I should sit in another person's house <lb/>
            mourning and wailing ; since it is worse to grieve for ever <lb/>
            without ceasing; for fear any one of the servants should <lb/>
            blame me, or even thou thyself; and should say that I in­ <lb/>
            crease my tears, having my mind heavy with wine."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope thus answered : " Stranger, of <lb/>
            a truth the immortals destroyed my excellence, and form, and <lb/>
            person, when the Grecians embarked for Ilium ; and amongst <lb/>
            them was my husband Ulysses. If he indeed coming should <lb/>
            manage my property, so would my fame be greater and more <lb/>
            honourable: but now I am grieved; for the deity has made <lb/>
            so many evils rush upon me. [For as many chiefs as rule <lb/>
            over the islands, Dulichium, and Samos, and woody Zacynthus, <lb/>
            and those who govern in western Ithaca itself, these woo me <lb/>
            against my will, and waste away mine house.] Therefore I <lb/>
            have no regard for strangers, or for suppliants, or at all for <lb/>
            heralds, who are public officers: but regretting Ulysses I am <lb/>
            melted away in my dear heart. And they hasten on my <lb/>
            marriage ; but I wind4 deceits: first of all the deity inspired <lb/>
            my mind to weave a large garment in the palace, having be­ <lb/>
            gun5 a large web, slender and round ; but I straightway ad­ <lb/>
            dressed them: ' Youths, my suitors, since divine Ulysses has <lb/>
            died, do ye remain, urging my marriage; until I shall finish <lb/>
            this garment, (that my threads may not perish in vain,) a <lb/>
            shroud for the hero Laertes, for the time when the destructive <lb/>
            fate of long-sleeping death shall seize on him. Lest some one <lb/>
            of the Grecian women amongst the people should be india­ <lb/>
            nant with me, if he, who having possessed many things, <note type="footnote"> 4 i. e. plan, devise. </note><note type="footnote">5 Literally, " having set up." </note> <pb n="262"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="148—150."/> <lb/>
            should lie without a shroud.' Thus I spoke ; and their haughty <lb/>
            mind was persuaded. Then during the day I wove the large <lb/>
            web, but at night, when I had set the torches near me, I un­ <lb/>
            ravelled it. Thus for three years I escaped them, and per­ <lb/>
            suaded the Grecians: but when the fourth year came, and <lb/>
            the hours advanced, [the months waning, and many days <lb/>
            were completed,] then they caught me, coming upon me <lb/>
            through means of the women servants, careless creatures ! and <lb/>
            chided me with words. So I finished it, although against my <lb/>
            will, by necessity; but now I neither can escape marriage, <lb/>
            nor do I discover any other counsel: and my parents very <lb/>
            much exhort me to marry: and my son grieves at their con­ <lb/>
            suming his property, knowing [that they are doing so] : for <lb/>
            now he is a man by all means able to take care of the house, <lb/>
            to whom Jove gives renown. But even so tell me thy race, <lb/>
            from whence thou art: for thou art not born of an old-fabled <lb/>
            oak, or from a rock."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " O venerable wife of Ulysses, son of Laertes, wilt thou not <lb/>
            yet cease inquiring my race ? But I will tell thee ; thou wilt <lb/>
            indeed give me up to more griefs, than [those] by which I <lb/>
            am already possessed: for this is the wont, when a man is ab­ <lb/>
            sent from his country so long a time, as I now am, wandering <lb/>
            over many cities of mortals, suffering griefs: but even so I <lb/>
            will tell thee that which thou askest and inquirest of me. <lb/>
            There is a certain land, Crete, in the middle of the dark sea, <lb/>
            beautiful and rich, surrounded with water ; and in it there are <lb/>
            many men, numberless, and ninety cities. And there is a <lb/>
            different language of different men, mixed together ; there are <lb/>
            in it Achaians, and magnanimous Eteocretans, and Cydonians, <lb/>
            and crest-shaking6 Dorians, and divine Pelasgians. And <lb/>
            amongst them is a large city, Cnossus: there Minos reigned, <lb/>
            who every nine years7 conversed with mighty Jove, the <lb/>
            father of my sire, magnanimous Deucalion. And Deucalion <note type="footnote"> 5 Or, " inhabiting three cities;" for some inhabited Euboea, others <lb/>

              begot me, and king Idomeneus; but he went in the crooked <lb/>
              ships to Ilium, together with the sons of Atreus: and my <lb/>
              renowned name is Æthon, the youngest in birth ; but he was <lb/>
              first and best. There I saw Ulysses, and gave him hospitable <lb/>
              gifts. For the strength of the wind drove him to Crete, as <lb/>
              he was making for Troy, making him to wander from the <lb/>
              Malearis; and placed him in Amnisus, (where too is the cave <lb/>
              of Ilytheia,) in a dangerous haven; and he scarcely escaped <lb/>
              the storms. But immediately coming up to the city, he in­ <lb/>
              quired for Idomeneus; for he said that he was a dear and <lb/>
              venerable guest of his. And he had now set out about ten <lb/>
              or eleven days with his crooked ships for Troy. I however <lb/>
              leading him to my abode, treated him well, entertaining him <lb/>
              heartily, having many things in my house : and I gave to him, <lb/>
              and to his other companions, who followed with him, meal <lb/>
              from the public stores, and dark wine, having collected it, <lb/>
              and beeves to sacrifice; that they might satiate their mind. <lb/>
              There the divine Grecians remained for twelve days; for a <lb/>
              great North wind drifted them, nor suffered them to stand <lb/>
              even on land; for some evil deity raised it; but on the thir­ <lb/>
              teenth day the wind fell; and they weighed anchor."</p>
          <p>He stopt,8 telling many falsehoods like unto truths: and <lb/>
            the tears flowed down from her, hearing it, and her body <lb/>
            wasted away. And as the snow has melted on the lofty moun­ <lb/>

            with tearful mourning, she straightway in answer addressed <lb/>
            him :</p>
          <p>" Now indeed, O stranger, I think that I will put thee to the <lb/>
            test, if in truth, as thou sayest, thou hast entertained my hus­ <lb/>
            band with his godlike companions in thy palace. Tell me what <lb/>
            kind of garments were put around his body, and himself, what <lb/>
            kind of a man lie was, and his companions who followed him."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: " O <lb/>
            lady, difficult it is to tell, when so long a time has elapsed <lb/>
            between : for it is now the twentieth year since he went <lb/>
            thence, and departed from my country; but even so I will tell <lb/>
            thee, as my heart makes it seem10 to me. Divine Ulysses had <lb/>
            a purple woollen cloak, double ; but there was a clasp of gold <lb/>
            made for it with two fastenings: 11 and in front it was va­ <lb/>
            riegated : a do- held in its fore feet a spotted fawn, enjoying <lb/>
            it panting ; and all marvelled at it, how they being of gold, <lb/>
            the one strangling the kid was enjoying it, but the other, <lb/>
            eager to escape, was convulsively struggling with its feet. <lb/>
            That beautiful garment I perceived around his body, like as <lb/>
            the rind of a slender onion. So soft was it, and it was shin­ <lb/>
            ing as the sun: many women indeed gazed upon it. But I <lb/>
            will tell thee something else, and do thou lay it up in thy <lb/>
            mind ; I know not whether Ulysses put these garments on his <lb/>
            body at home, or whether some one of his companions gave <lb/>
            them to him, as he was going in the swift ship, or perhaps <lb/>
            some stranger; since Ulysses was dear to many; for there <lb/>
            were few of the Grecians like unto him. And I gave to him <lb/>
            a brazen sword, and a beautiful, purple, double cloak, and a <lb/>
            garment reaching to his feet; and I sent him away honourably <lb/>
            on a well-benched ship. And a herald, a little older than <lb/>
            himself, followed him; and I will tell thee concerning him, <lb/>
            what kind of a man he was; round-shouldered, dark-coloured <lb/>
            with curly hair, and his name was Eurybates: but Ulysses <lb/>
            honoured him chief among his companions, because he knew <lb/>
            in his mind what was proper." <note type="footnote"> 10 lIes. '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ινδάλλεται, ὁμοιου̃ται, φαίνεται, δοκει̃, στοχάζεται</foreign>. Timæus <lb/>

          <p>Thus he spoke, and still more encouraged the desire of grief <lb/>
            in her, recognising the signs, which Ulysses told her plainly. <lb/>
            She therefore, after she was satiated with tearful mourning, <lb/>
            then indeed addressed him in answer:</p>
          <p>" Now indeed, O stranger, although thou wast before an <lb/>
            object of pity in my palace, thou shalt be dear and revered : <lb/>
            for I myself gave him these garments, which thou dost men­ <lb/>
            tion, having folded them up from my chamber: and I put the <lb/>
            shining clasp upon them, to be an ornament for him : but him <lb/>
            I shall not receive again, returning home to his dear country. <lb/>
            Therefore Ulysses went by evil fate in the hollow ship, to see <lb/>
            that ill-Troy, not to be named."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: " O <lb/>
            venerable wife of Ulysses, son of Laertes, now no longer waste <lb/>
            thy beauteous person, nor consume thy mind, mourning for <lb/>
            thy husband : however, I could not be angry with thee at all: <lb/>
            for any woman, having lost her lawful husband, (to whom <lb/>
            she has borne children, and having been mingled with him in <lb/>
            love,) though inferior to Ulysses, whom they say is like unto <lb/>
            the gods, laments for him. But cease from thy grief, and <lb/>
            attend to what I say: for I will tell thee truly, nor will I con­ <lb/>
            ceal it, that I lately heard of the return of Ulysses, of his <lb/>
            being alive, in a rich people near the Thesprotians: but he <lb/>
            brings much and excellent treasure, begging it through the <lb/>
            people : but he has lost his beloved companions and his hollow <lb/>
            ship, in the dark sea, as he was going from the island of <lb/>
            Trinacria: for Jove and the Sun were wrath with him, for <lb/>
            his companions slew the oxen [of the Sun]. All of them <lb/>
            perished in the boisterous sea; but the wave drove him up on <lb/>
            the keel of the ship to the shore, to the land of the Phæacians, <lb/>
            who are near to the gods. But him they honoured exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly, like as a god, and gave him many things, and them­ <lb/>
            selves wished to escort him home unharmed; and Ulysses <lb/>
            would have been here some time ago; but it seemed to him <lb/>
            in his mind to be better to go over much land and collect <lb/>
            possessions; since Ulysses knew many means of gain above <lb/>
            mortal men : nor would any other mortal contend with him, as <lb/>
            Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians, told me. And be swore <lb/>
            to me myself, pouring out a libation in the house, that the <lb/>
            ship was drawn down, and that companions were ready, who <pb n="266"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="290—330."/> <lb/>
            would at length escort him to his dear paternal land. But me <lb/>
            he sent away first; for a ship of the Thesprotians happened to <lb/>
            be coming to wheat-abounding Dulichium. And to me he <lb/>
            showed the possessions, whatsoever Ulysses had collected; <lb/>
            and they would support another man even to the tenth gener­ <lb/>
            ation, so many treasures of his lie in the palace of the king <lb/>
            And he said that he was gone to Dodona, that he might ask <lb/>
            the counsel of God from the lofty-tressed oak of Jove, in what <lb/>
            way he should return to his dear paternal land, having been <lb/>
            now a long time absent, whether openly or secretly. So he <lb/>
            is thus safe, and will come now very near, nor any more will he <lb/>
            for a long time be far away from his friends and paternal land ; <lb/>
            however I will plight thee an oath: now let Jove first be <lb/>
            witness, the highest and most excellent of the gods, and the <lb/>
            hearth of blameless Ulysses, to which I am come, all these <lb/>
            things shall surely be brought to pass, as I relate them: <lb/>
            Ulysses will come here in this same year, when this month <lb/>
            wanes, and the next begins."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn : "Would that, <lb/>
            O stranger, this word might be accomplished: then shouldst <lb/>
            thou soon experience my friendship, and [receive] many gifts <lb/>
            from me; so that any one who met thee would congratulate <lb/>
            thee. But thus does it appear to me in my mind, even as it <lb/>
            will be: neither will Ulysses any more come home, nor will <lb/>
            thou obtain an escort: since there are not masters in the house, <lb/>
            such as was Ulysses amongst men, (if ever he was) to send <lb/>
            away and to receive venerable strangers. But wash him, hand­ <lb/>
            maidens, and place a bed for him, couches and cloaks, and <lb/>
            beautiful rugs, that being well warmed he may reach the <lb/>
            golden-throned Morn. But very early in the morning wash <lb/>
            and anoint him, that sitting within near Telemachus he may <lb/>
            take care of his meal: but it shall be more sad for him, who­ <lb/>
            ever of them afflicting him in mind causes him sorrow, and he <lb/>
            shall no more effect any work here, although exceedingly en­ <lb/>
            raged. For how, stranger, wilt thou know of me, whether I <lb/>
            excel other women at all in thought, or prudent counsel, if <lb/>
            thou feastest in the palace, squalid, ill-clad ? but men are <lb/>
            short-lived. Whoever is himself cruel, and knows what is <lb/>
            cruel, upon him all mortals imprecate griefs hereafter when <lb/>
            alive but all scoff at him when dead: but whoever is him- <pb n="267"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="331-372."/> <lb/>
            self blameless, and knows what is blameless, his fame strangers <lb/>
            bear far and wide amongst all men: and many call him ex­ <lb/>
            cellent."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " O venerable wife of Ulysses, son of Laertes, cloaks and <lb/>
            beautiful rugs are indeed a burden to me, since I was first <lb/>
            separated from the snowy mountains of Crete, going in a long- <lb/>
            oared ship. But I will lie, as I have hitherto rested during the <lb/>
            sleepless nights. For already have I lain many nights in an <lb/>
            unseemly bed, and have waited for beautiful-throned divine <lb/>
            morning. Nor are foot-baths for my feet at all agreeable to <lb/>
            my mind; nor shall any of the women, who are servants in <lb/>
            thy house, touch my foot, unless there is some old woman, <lb/>
            who kens what is prudent, who has endured so many things <lb/>
            in her mind, as I have, I would not grudge that she should <lb/>
            touch my feet."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in answer: " Dear <lb/>
            stranger! for not yet has any foreign stranger come, thus <lb/>
            prudent, or more welcome to my house, so very skilfully dost <lb/>
            thou speak all things that are prudent: I have an old woman, <lb/>
            who possesses prudent counsels in her mind, who nurtured <lb/>
            well and brought up him, wretched one, having received him <lb/>
            in her hands, when his mother first brought him forth, she <lb/>
            will wash thy feet, although having but little strength. But <lb/>
            come now, O prudent Euryclea, rising up, wash one who is of <lb/>
            equal age with thy master: such perhaps is Ulysses now as <lb/>
            to feet and hands. For quickly do mortals grow old in mis­ <lb/>
            fortune."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke : but the old woman covered her face with <lb/>
            her hands, and shed warm tears; and she uttered a mournful <lb/>
            word:</p>
          <p>" Alas for me ! child, I know not what to do on thine ac­ <lb/>
            count ; surely Jove hates thee above men, thee who didst pos­ <lb/>
            sess a godlike mind. For no one of mortals has ever burnt <lb/>
            so many rich thighs to thunder-rejoicing Jove, nor chosen <lb/>
            hecatombs, as thou hast given him, praying that thou mightest <lb/>
            reach a quiet old age, and mightest bring up thine illustrious <lb/>
            son: but now he has thus altogether taken away from thee <lb/>
            the day of return. So perchance the women of foreign hosts <lb/>
            mock at him, when he comes under their illustrious dwell­ <lb/>
            ings, as these impudent ones all mock at thee; shunning <pb n="268"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="373-410"/> <lb/>
            whose insolence and many reproaches, thou alost not suffer <lb/>
            them to wash thee: but the daughter of lcarius, prudent Pe­ <lb/>
            nelope, desires me who am not unwilling. Therefore I will <lb/>
            wash thy feet, both for Penelope's sake and thine: since my <lb/>
            mind is troubled within with cares: but now understand the <lb/>
            word which I say, many wretched strangers have already come <lb/>
            here, but I do not think that I have ever seen any one thus <lb/>
            like, as thou art like unto Ulysses, both in body and voice and <lb/>
            feet."</p>
          <p>But her much-counselling Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " O old woman, so they say, as many as have beheld both of <lb/>
            us with their eyes, that we are very like one another; as thou <lb/>
            thyself wisely sayest."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but the old woman took a shining cauldron, <lb/>
            in which she washed his feet, and into it she poured much <lb/>
            cold water; and then she mixed warm with it: but Ulysses <lb/>
            sat on the hearth, but he quickly turned towards a dark place : <lb/>
            for he immediately reflected in his mind, that she, finding the <lb/>
            scar, would discover him, and that his deeds would become <lb/>
            manifest. And she, going near her master, washed him ; and <lb/>
            she immediately recognised the scar; which once a boar had <lb/>
            inflicted upon him with its white tusk, as he was going to <lb/>
            Parnassus with Autolycus and his sons, the excellent sire of <lb/>
            his mother, who surpassed men in deceitfulness and in oaths: <lb/>
            but to him the god Mercury himself gave [this gift]: for to <lb/>
            him he burnt the acceptable thighs of lambs and kids ; but he <lb/>
            willingly accompanied him. But Autolycus coming to the <lb/>
            rich people of Ithaca, found the son of his daughter lately <lb/>
            born ; him Euryclea placed on his dear knees when he ceased <lb/>
            from supper ; and she spoke and said :</p>
          <p>" Autolycus, do thou now thyself find out a name, which <lb/>
            thou mayest give to the dear son of thy daughter; for by many <lb/>
            prayers has he been obtained."</p>
          <p>But her Autolycus answered and addressed in turn : " Do <lb/>
            ye, my son-in-law and my daughter, give him the name <lb/>
            which I mention : since I have come hither, hated by many <lb/>
            men and women, through the many-feeding earth, therefore <lb/>
            let the name given to him be Ulysses : 13 but I, when he, being <lb/>
            grown up, comes to Parnassus, to his great maternal house, <note type="footnote"> 13 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οδυσεὺς</foreign>, from the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">όδύσσω</foreign>, to be wroth. See Eustathius. </note> <pb n="269"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="411-455."/> <lb/>
            where are my possessions, will give him some of them, and <lb/>
            will send him away rejoicing."</p>
          <p>On account of these things came Ulysses, that he might <lb/>
            give to him handsome presents. Autolycus, and the sons of <lb/>
            Autolycus, welcomed him with their hands and with mild <lb/>
            words. But his maternal grandmother Amphithea, embracing <lb/>
            Ulysses, kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes. And <lb/>
            Autolycus commanded his glorious sons to make ready a ban­ <lb/>
            quet ; and they heard him inciting them. And they immedi­ <lb/>
            ately brought a male beeve of five years old : they skinned it, <lb/>
            and handled it, and severed it all. And they cut it up skilfully, <lb/>
            and fixed it on spits, and roasted it cleverly, and divided the <lb/>
            shares. Thus then they feasted during the whole day until SUB­ <lb/>
            set ; nor did the mind at all want an equal feast. But when the <lb/>
            sun set, and darkness came on, then they lay down to rest, <lb/>
            and took the gift of sleep. But when the mother of dawn, <lb/>
            rosy-fingered morning, appeared, they set out to the hunt, both <lb/>
            the dogs, and the sons of Autolycus ; and divine Ulysses went <lb/>
            with them : and they came to the lofty mountain of Parnassus, <lb/>
            clad in wood; and they soon reached the windy heights. <lb/>
            The sun had just then struck upon the fields from the gentle- <lb/>
            flowing, deep-streamed ocean; and the huntsmen came to the <lb/>
            dell; and the dogs went before them, searching out their <lb/>
            tracks; but behind came the sons of Autolycus, and with <lb/>
            them divine Ulysses, near the dogs, brandishing a long- <lb/>
            shadowing spear. There a large boar lay down in a dense <lb/>
            thicket; which neither the force of the moist-blowing winds <lb/>
            breathed through, nor did the shining sun strike it with its <lb/>
            beams, nor did the shower penetrate through it; so thick was <lb/>
            • it, but there was a great mass of dry leaves shed in it. And <lb/>
            around him came the sound of the feet of men and dogs, as <lb/>
            they came driving on ; but he opposite, out of the woody lair, <lb/>
            bristling well his neck, and looking fire with his eyes, stood <lb/>
            near them; but Ulysses rushed on much the first, holding up <lb/>
            his long spear with his strong hand, eager to wound him ; but <lb/>
            the boar anticipating him, struck him over the knee ; and he <lb/>
            tore out much flesh with his tusk, rushing obliquely, nor did <lb/>
            he reach the bone of the man. But him Ulysses wounded, <lb/>
            hitting him on the right shoulder, and straight through him <lb/>
            the point of the shining spear passed ; and he fell groaning in <lb/>
            the dust: and life flew from him. Him however the kind <pb n="270"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="455-494."/> <lb/>
            sons of Autolycus took care of, and they skilfully bound the <lb/>
            wound of godlike blameless Ulysses: and they stopped <lb/>
            the black blood by a spell, and quickly reached the house of <lb/>
            their dear sire. Autolycus then, and the sons of Autolycus, <lb/>
            having healed him well, and having given him splendid gifts, <lb/>
            quickly rejoicing, sent him rejoicing to dear Ithaca: but on his <lb/>
            return his father and venerable mother rejoiced, and inquired <lb/>
            every thing of him, as to the scar, what he suffered: but he <lb/>
            related it well to them, how the boar struck him with his <lb/>
            white tusk as he was hunting, having come to Parnassus with <lb/>
            the sons of Autolycus.</p>
          <p>But the old woman, taking it in her hands placed flat, <lb/>
            and wiping it, recognised it: and she let his foot fall: and <lb/>
            his leg fell in the cauldron ; and the brass resounded, and was <lb/>
            turned on one side: and the water was poured out on the <lb/>
            ground. And joy and grief possessed her mind at the same <lb/>
            time ; and her eyes were filled with tears: and her warm voice <lb/>
            was choked. And touching Ulysses by the beard, she ad­ <lb/>
            dressed him:</p>
          <p>" Certainly, my dear child, thou art Ulysses: nor did I <lb/>
            know thee before I had handled my master all round."</p>
          <p>She spoke, and looked at Penelope with her eyes, wishing <lb/>
            to tell her that her dear husband was within. But she was <lb/>
            neither able to look opposite to her, nor to perceive her; for <lb/>
            Minerva turned away her thoughts : but Ulysses holding out <lb/>
            his hand, took her by the throat with his right hand; and <lb/>
            with the other he himself drew her near and addressed her :</p>
          <p>" Nurse, why dost thou wish to destroy me ? thou thyself <lb/>
            didst nourish me at thy breast, but now, having endured <lb/>
            many toils I am returned in the twentieth year to my paternal <lb/>
            land. But since thou hast perceived me, and God has put it <lb/>
            in thy mind, be silent, lest any other in the palace should hear <lb/>
            it. For thus I tell thee, and this shall be accomplished, if God <lb/>
            shall subdue the proud suitors under me, I shall not spare <lb/>
            thee, although thou art my nurse, when I slay the other women <lb/>
            servants in my palace."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Euryclea addressed in turn : " My child, <lb/>
            what word hast thou uttered ? thou knowest how firm my <lb/>
            mind is, that it does not yield; but I will keep like as some <lb/>
            hard rock, or steel: and I will tell thee something else, and <note type="footnote"> 14 i. e, the wounded foot </note> <pb n="271"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="495-532."/> <lb/>
            do thou lay ic up in thy mind ; if God shall subdue the proud <lb/>
            suitors under thee, then will I enumerate to thee the women <lb/>
            in the palace, who dishonour thee, and who are innocent."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " Nurse, why shouldst thou point them out ? it is not at all <lb/>
            requisite that thou shouldst : I myself can tell them well, <lb/>
            and shall know each one. But hold thy peace in silence, and <lb/>
            commit it to the gods."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke: and the old woman went through out of <lb/>
            the palace, to bring a foot-bath ; for all the first was poured <lb/>
            out. But when she had washed, and anointed him with the <lb/>
            smooth oil, Ulysses again drew his seat nearer the fire to <lb/>
            warm himself, but he covered the scar with rags. And pru­ <lb/>
            dent Penelope began speaking to them:</p>
          <p>" O stranger, I myself will ask this of thee for a little longer ; <lb/>
            for soon it will be time for delightful sleep, [for] whomsoever <lb/>
            sweet sleep lays hold of, although in trouble. But to me the <lb/>
            deity has given immeasurable grief; for I am delighted during <lb/>
            the days mourning, grieving, looking to my works and those <lb/>
            of my handmaidens in the house: but when night comes, and <lb/>
            bed receives all, I lie down on my couch, and constant, sharp <lb/>
            cares about my heart irritate me, lamenting continually. As <lb/>
            when the daughter of Pandarus, the swarthy nightingale, sings <lb/>
            beautifully when the spring newly begins, sitting in the thick <lb/>
            branches of trees, and she frequently changing, pours forth <lb/>
            her much-sounding voice, lamenting her dear Itylus, (whom <lb/>
            once she slew with the brass through ignorance,15) the offspring <lb/>
            of the king Zethus: so also two ways is my mind excited on <lb/>
            one side and the other, whether I should remain with my son, <lb/>
            and guard all things firmly, my property, and my servants, <lb/>
            and my large lofty-roofed house, reverencing the bed of my <lb/>
            spouse, and the voice of the people; or whether I should fol­ <lb/>
            low him that is the best of the Grecians, who woos me, in the <lb/>
            palace, and gives me infinite bridal gifts. But my son, as long <lb/>
            as he was still a child, and weak-minded, did not suffer me to <lb/>
            marry, leaving him in the house of my husband; but now <lb/>
            when he is full grown, and arrived at the age of manhood, he <note type="footnote"> 15 She intended to slay the soil of her husband's brother Amphion, in­ <lb/>

            punishment was transformed by Jupiter into a nightingale. Cowpei </note> <pb n="272"/>

            begs of me to go away from the palace, angry on account <lb/>
            of the wealth, which the Grecians are consuming for him. <lb/>
            But come, expound a dream for me, and hearken to it: twenty <lb/>
            geese in my house eat wheat out of the water, and I was de­ <lb/>
            lighted, looking at them; but a large crooked-beaked eagle <lb/>
            coming from a mountain, broke the necks of all of them, and <lb/>
            slew them: and they were strewn together in the palace, but <lb/>
            he was lifted up into the divine air. But I wept and wailed, <lb/>
            although in a dream, and the fair-haired Grecian women were <lb/>
            assembled around me complaining piteously, that the eagle <lb/>
            had killed my geese. But coming back he sat down on the <lb/>
            projecting roof; and restrained me with a mortal voice, and <lb/>
            spoke : ' Be of good cheer, O daughter of far-famed Icarius ; <lb/>
            it is not a dream, but an excellent vision,16 which shall be <lb/>
            brought to pass. The geese are the suitors ; and I before was <lb/>
            an eagle, but now am come, thy husband, who will bring un­ <lb/>
            seemly fate upon all the suitors.' Thus he spoke; and sweet <lb/>
            sleep left me. And looking about, I saw the geese in the <lb/>
            palace, eating wheat near the trough, where they before <lb/>
            [eat it]."</p>
          <p>But her much-counselling Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " O lady, it is not possible to expound the dream turning in <lb/>
            any other way ; since Ulysses himself told thee how it will be <lb/>
            performed ; but destruction has appeared to all the suitors ; <lb/>
            nor will any one escape death and fate."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn: " Stranger, <lb/>
            dreams are indeed uncertain, and speak things which cannot <lb/>
            be determined, nor are all brought to pass for men. For <lb/>
            there are two portals of unsubstantial dreams ; these are made <lb/>
            of horn, and those of ivory; whichever of them17 comes <lb/>
            through the sawn ivory, they deceive, bringing promises <lb/>
            which will never be fulfilled ; but those which come out of <lb/>
            doors through the polished horn, accomplish what is true, <lb/>
            when any one of mortals sees them. But I think not that the <lb/>
            terrible dream came to me from thence; so it would be de­ <lb/>
            lightful for me and for my son. But I will tell thee some­ <lb/>

            Ulysses ; for now I will propose as a contest the pole-axes <lb/>
            which he used to place in order in his palace, like the ribs of <lb/>
            a ship,18 twelve in all, and he, standing a great way off, shot <lb/>
            the arrow through them. Now I will propose this contest to <lb/>
            the suitors ; whoever shall most easily stretch the bow in his <lb/>
            hands, and shoot the arrow through all the twelve hatchets, <lb/>
            him will I follow, leaving this house, which I entered when <lb/>
            a virgin, very beautiful, full of wealth ; which I think I shall <lb/>
            some time or other remember, even in a dream."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer : <lb/>
            " O venerable wife of Ulysses, son of Laertes, no longer now <lb/>
            put off this contest in the house ; for much-planning Ulysses <lb/>
            will come here before they, handling this well-polished bow, <lb/>
            stretch the string, and shoot the arrow through the steel."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn : " If thou <lb/>
            wast willing, O stranger, sitting by me in the palace to delight <lb/>
            me, sleep would not be shed over my eyelids. But it is not <lb/>
            possible for men to be always without sleep ; for in every <lb/>
            thing the immortals have given their lot to mortals over the <lb/>
            fruitful plain. But I indeed, going to the upper room, will lie <lb/>
            down on my bed, which has become sad to me, ever moistened <lb/>
            with my tears, from the time when Ulysses went to behold <lb/>
            ill-Troy, which ought not to be named. There will I lie <lb/>
            down ; but do thou lie in this house, either strewing [a bed] <lb/>
            upon the ground, or let them lay down a couch for thee."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, she ascended to the beautiful upper <lb/>
            rooms, not alone: [for] other handmaidens also went with <lb/>
            her. And having ascended to the upper room with her women <lb/>
            attendants, she then wept for Ulysses, her dear husband ; <lb/>
            until blue-eyed Minerva cast sweet sleep upon her eye-lids. <note type="footnote"> 18 Twelve stakes (rather, pole-axes) were fixed in the earth, each <lb/>

          <p>Ulysses is reassured by a vision of Minerva, but upon waking he hesitates <lb/>
            whether or not to destroy the women servants, he however resolves to <lb/>
            spare them for the present. The suitors, who had been meditating fresh <lb/>
            plots against Telemachus, while feasting are struck by a panic; from <lb/>
            whence Theoclymenus foretells their ruin, but they deride his prophecy</p>
          <p>BUT divine Ulysses slept in the vestibule; he strewed upon <lb/>
            the ground an undressed bull's hide, but above it many skins <lb/>
            of sheep, which the Grecians had sacrificed. And Eurynome <lb/>
            threw a cloak over him when he lay down. There Ulysses <lb/>
            meditating evil in his mind against the suitors, lay awake; <lb/>
            and the women, who were before mingled with the suitors, <lb/>
            went out of the palace, furnishing laughter and merriment to <lb/>
            each other. And his mind was excited in his breast; and <lb/>
            much he meditated in his soul and in his mind, whether, rush­ <lb/>
            ing upon them, lie should cause death to each of them, or <lb/>
            should still suffer them to be mingled with the overbearing <lb/>
            suitors for the last and latest time: and his heart was greatly <lb/>
            disturbed1 within him. And as a bitch going about her ten­ <lb/>
            der whelps, growls at a man when she knows [him] not, and <lb/>
            is eager to fight with him; so his heart growled within him, <lb/>
            marvelling at their evil deeds. And smiting his breast, he <lb/>
            chided his heart in words :</p>
          <p>" Endure it now, my heart; thou once didst endure some­ <lb/>
            thing else even more severe, in that day when the Cyclops, <lb/>
            intolerable in might, eat thy stout companions, but thou didst <lb/>
            endure it, until stratagem took thee out of the cave, when thou <lb/>
            thoughtest that thou wonldst die."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, rebuking the dear heart in his breast: and <lb/>
            his heart remained at rest,2 unceasingly enduring it; but he <lb/>
            turned himself on one side and the other. As when a mail, <lb/>
            while a large fire is blazing, turns a paunch full of fat and <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally, " barked." Cf. Stat. Sylv. ii. 1, 12. " stat pectore demens <lb/>

            blood, from side to side, and is anxious that it should be roasted <lb/>
            very quickly; so did he roll himself on one side and the other, <lb/>
            meditating how he might lay his hands upon the shameless <lb/>
            suitors, being alone amongst many; but Minerva came near <lb/>
            to him, descending from heaven : and in her person she was <lb/>
            like unto a woman, and she stood over his head, and addressed <lb/>
            him in words:</p>
          <p>" Why dost thou still watch, thou who art ill-fated above <lb/>
            all mortals ? this is thy house, and this is thy wife in the <lb/>
            house, and thy son, such a one as any one desires his son <lb/>
            to be."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            " Of a truth, O goddess, thou hast rightly spoken all these <lb/>
            things. But my mind meditates this in my breast, in what <lb/>
            way I, being alone, shall lay my hands upon the shameless <lb/>
            suitors ; but they are always collected together within. And <lb/>
            besides I meditate this also a greater thing in my mind, if I <lb/>
            should slay them, by Jove's and thy will, how should 1 escape <lb/>
            out of the way ? I entreat thee to consider this."</p>
          <p>But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva in turn addressed: <lb/>
            " Wretched one, a person would obey even a worse companion, <lb/>
            who is even a mortal, and who kens not so many counsels: <lb/>
            but I am a deity, who guard thee throughout in all thy la­ <lb/>
            bours ; and I will tell thee openly; even if fifty bands of <lb/>
            articulately-speaking men should surround us, anxious to slay <lb/>
            us in the fight, even so shouldst thou drive away their beeves <lb/>
            and rich sheep. But let sleep take hold of thee: even to <lb/>
            watch all night awake is a sorrow; but thou wilt soon escape <lb/>
            from misfortunes."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke and shed sleep over his eyelids; and the <lb/>
            divine one of goddesses herself went back to Olympus, when <lb/>
            sleep seized upon him, loosing the cares of his mind, relaxing <lb/>
            his limbs: but his wife knowing prudent things was awake: <lb/>
            and sitting on her soft couch, she wept; but when she was <lb/>
            satiated in her mind with weeping, the divine one of women <lb/>
            first of all prayed to Diana:</p>
          <p>" O Diana, venerable goddess, daughter of Jove, would that <lb/>
            thou, now striking an arrow into my breast, wouldst take away <lb/>
            my life immediately: or that a tempest snatching me away <lb/>
            would speedily go, and bear me to the dark ways, and east <lb/>
            me in the mouths of the back-flowing ocean. As when the <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="66—107."/> <lb/>
            tempests took away the daughters of Pandamus, whose parents <lb/>
            the gods had destroyed: but they were left orphans in the <lb/>
            palace, and divine Venus nurtured them with cheese, and <lb/>
            sweet honey, and pleasant wine: and Juno gave them beauty <lb/>
            and prudence above all women, and chaste Diana gave them <lb/>
            stature, and Minerva taught them to work excellent works. <lb/>
            When divine Venus went to high Olympus, to be- for the <lb/>
            damsels the accomplishment of flourishing marriage, to thun­ <lb/>
            der-rejoicing Jove; (for he well kens every thing, the happi­ <lb/>
            ness and unhappiness of mortal men :) in the mean time the <lb/>
            Harpies snatched away the damsels, and gave them to the <lb/>
            hateful Furies, to serve them: so may those who possess the <lb/>
            Olympian dwellings destroy me, or may fair-haired Diana <lb/>
            strike me, that eyeing Ulysses, I may even come under the <lb/>
            hateful earth, nor may I at all delight the mind of a worse <lb/>
            man. But this evil is even to be borne, when any one weeps <lb/>
            during the day, continually sorrowing in his heart, and sleep <lb/>
            possesses him during the nights : (for he becomes unmindful <lb/>
            of all things, good and evil, when it covers his eyelids around :) <lb/>
            but upon me the deity has also made evil dreams rush. For <lb/>
            during this night one lay near to me like unto him, such as <lb/>
            he was when he went with the army; but my heart rejoiced, <lb/>
            since I did not think it was a dream, but now a real vision."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke ; and golden-throned Morn immediately <lb/>
            came. And divine Ulysses heard the voice of her weeping ; <lb/>
            then he doubted, for she seemed to him in his mind, now <lb/>
            knowing him, to stand near his head. Then taking up the <lb/>
            cloak and skins on which he slept, he placed them on a throne <lb/>
            in the palace; but taking the bull's hide, he put it out of <lb/>
            doors: and holding up his hands he prayed to Jove:</p>
          <p>" O father Jove, thou hast brought me willingly over the <lb/>
            dry and the moist to mine own land, since thou hast afflicted <lb/>
            me very much, let some one of the men who are awake within <lb/>
            speak an omen to me: and let some other sign appear from <lb/>
            without from Jove."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke praying ; and provident Jupiter heard him : <lb/>
            and he immediately thundered from shining Olympus, on high <lb/>
            from the clouds: and divine Ulysses rejoiced. And a mill­ <lb/>
            woman near [him] uttered a word of good omen from the <lb/>
            house, where were the mills of the shepherd of the people; <lb/>
            and twelve women in all were constantly working at them, <pb n="277"/>

            making meal of barley and wheat, the marrow of men. The <lb/>
            rest indeed were sleeping, when they had ground their wheat: <lb/>
            but she alone had not yet ceased, for she was the weakest: <lb/>
            she then, stopping the mill, spoke a word, a sign to her <lb/>
            master:</p>
          <p>" O father Jove, who rulest over gods and men, thou indeed <lb/>
            hast thundered very loudly from the starny heaven, nor is <lb/>
            there a cloud any where: thou showest this as a sign to some <lb/>
            one : perform even now for wretched me a request, which I <lb/>
            crave: may the suitors for the last and latest time on this day <lb/>
            take a delightful banquet in the palace of Ulysses: they who <lb/>
            have now loosed my knees with grievous toil, grinding their <lb/>
            meal; now may they feast for the last time."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke, and divine Ulysses rejoiced in the omen, <lb/>
            and in the thunder of Jove ; for he thought that he should be <lb/>
            revenged on the sinners. But the other handmaidens in the <lb/>
            beautiful house of Ulysses waking, lighted an unwearied fire <lb/>
            upon the hearth. And Telemachus, godlike man, arose from <lb/>
            his bed, having put on his garments ; and around his shoulder <lb/>
            he girt a sharp sword: and he bound beautiful sandals under <lb/>
            his smooth feet, and he took a strong spear tipt with sharp <lb/>
            brass. And going to the threshold he stood there, and ad­ <lb/>
            dressed Euryclea:</p>
          <p>" Dear nurse, how hast thou honoured the stranger in the <lb/>
            house with a bed and food ? or does he lie where he can, uu­ <lb/>
            cared for? for such is my mother, although prudent; she <lb/>
            foolishly honours one of articulately-speaking men, who is <lb/>
            worse, and sends away a better, having neglected [him]."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Euryclea addressed in turn: " Thou <lb/>
            shouldst not, my child, blame one that is blameless. For sit­ <lb/>
            ting down he drank wine, as long as he listed; and he said <lb/>
            that he no longer hungered for bread; for it was asked of <lb/>
            him. But when she was now mindful of rest and sleep, she <lb/>
            desired the handmaidens to strew a couch [for him]; but he, <lb/>
            as one altogether overcome with toil, and ill-fated, did not wish <lb/>
            to sleep on a bed and in rugs, but lay down in the vestibule <lb/>
            on an undressed bull's hide and skins of sheep: and we put <lb/>
            a cloak over him."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke; and Telemachus went through out of the <lb/>
            palace, holding his spear: and swift-footed dogs followed him. <lb/>
            And he went to the forum amongst the well-greaved Grecians. <pb n="278"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="146—181"/> <lb/>
            and the divine one of women, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, son <lb/>
            of Pisenor, exhorted the handmaidens :</p>
          <p>" Assemble yourselves together, do some of you, busying <lb/>
            yourselves, sweep the house, and sprinkle it; and lay the <lb/>
            purple tapestry on the well-made thrones ; and do others wipe <lb/>
            all the tables with sponges, and clean the cups, and the em­ <lb/>
            bossed round bowls: and others of you going to the fountain <lb/>
            for water, bring it quickly : for the suitors will not be a long <lb/>
            time away from the palace, but they return very early, since <lb/>
            there is a feast for all."3</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke ; and they heard her very well, and obeyed <lb/>
            her. Twenty went to the black-water fountain ; and others <lb/>
            laboured skilfully there in the house. And the servants of <lb/>
            the Greeks came; they then cleft wood well and skilfully; <lb/>
            and the women came from the fountain ; and the swineherd <lb/>
            came to them, bringing three fatted swine, which were the <lb/>
            best amongst all. And them he left to pasture in the beauti­ <lb/>
            ful courts, and himself addressed Ulysses in mild [words]:</p>
          <p>" Stranger, do the Grecians now regard thee more, or do <lb/>
            they dishonour thee in the palace, even as before?"</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer: <lb/>
            "Would that indeed, O Eumæus, the gods would revenge the <lb/>
            insolence with which they, insulting, contrive disgraceful <lb/>
            things in another man's house, nor have they a particle of <lb/>
            shame."</p>
          <p>Thus they discoursed to one another. And near them <lb/>
            came Melanthius the goatherd, bringing goats, which sur­ <lb/>
            passed all the flocks, as a feast for the suitors; and two <lb/>
            attendants followed him, and he bound them4 under the re­ <lb/>
            sounding portico, and himself then addressed Ulysses with <lb/>
            scofling words:</p>
          <p>" Stranger, wilt thou still now give trouble here in the <lb/>
            house, begging alms of the men ? and wilt not thou go out <lb/>
            of doors ? I no longer think that we shall at all settle our <lb/>
            quarrel, before we try our hands; since thou beggest not <lb/>
            rightly; there are also other feasts of the Grecians."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but much-planning Ulysses did not ad­ <lb/>
            dress him at all, but moved his head in silence, deeply de­ <lb/>
            vising evils. And after them Philætius, chief of men, came <note type="footnote"> i. e. a public feast to Apollo. See Scholiast. </note><note type="footnote">* The goals. </note> <pb n="279"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="186—227."/> <lb/>
            third, bringing a heifer and fat goats for the suitors. (But <lb/>
            ferrymen brought them over, who also conduct other men, <lb/>
            whoever comes to them:) and he bound them safely under <lb/>
            the resounding portico, and himself then inquired of the <lb/>
            swineherd, standing near himin</p>
          <p>" What stranger is this, O swineherd, that has lately come <lb/>
            to our house ? from what men does he boast himself to be ? <lb/>
            where are his race and paternal country ? unhappy one, he is <lb/>
            indeed in his person like unto a king. But the gods inflict <lb/>
            much-wandering men with woe; when they destine toil even <lb/>
            for kings."</p>
          <p>He spoke; and standing near him, welcomed him with his <lb/>
            hand, and addressing him spoke winged words: " Hail, O <lb/>
            father stranger, mayest thou have happiness hereafter: but <lb/>
            now thou art possessed with many ills. O father Jove, no <lb/>
            other one of the gods is more destructive than thou ; thou <lb/>
            pitiest not men, when thou hast begotten them thyself, but <lb/>
            dost mix them up in misfortune and sad griefs. I sweat when <lb/>
            I behold him, and mine eyes wept as I remembered Ulysses; <lb/>
            since I think that he, having such garments, is wandering, <lb/>
            amongst men, if he is any where still alive, and beholds the <lb/>
            light of the sun. But if he is now dead, and in the house of <lb/>
            Pluto, alas ! then for blameless Ulysses, who set me over his <lb/>
            beeves when I was still little, in the people of the Cephale­ <lb/>
            nians : but now they are numberless, nor in any other way <lb/>
            would the race of broad-foreheaded beeves increase under a <lb/>
            man: them others desire me to bring for themselves to eat: <lb/>
            nor care they at all for his son in the palace, nor do they fear <lb/>
            the vengeance of the gods ; for they are now anxious to divide <lb/>
            the possessions of the long-absent king. But my mind often <lb/>
            revolves this in my dear breast: it is very wicked, when the <lb/>
            son is alive, going to another people with the cattle them­ <lb/>
            selves, to take them to foreign men : but this is more sad, re­ <lb/>
            maining here and sitting over another man's beeves, to suffer <lb/>
            griefs. I indeed would long ago have fled and gone to some <lb/>
            other proud king; since these things are no longer to be <lb/>
            borne, but still I think of him, wretched one, if coming from <lb/>
            any where he should make a dispersing of the suitors to their <lb/>
            houses."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses addressed in answer; <lb/>
            ' O herdsman, since thou art not like unto an evil or a foolish <pb n="280"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="228—237."/> <lb/>
            but I myself also know that prudence reaches thy mind, <lb/>
            therefore I will tell thee, and swear a great oath besides. Now <lb/>
            let Jove, first of the gods, be witness, and the hospitable table, <lb/>
            and the hearth of blameless Ulysses, to which I am come, <lb/>
            Ulysses will certainly come home while thou art here; and it <lb/>
            thou desirest, thou wilt with thine eyes behold the suitors <lb/>
            being slain, who reign here."</p>
          <p>But him the man, herdsman over the oxen, addressed in <lb/>
            turn: " Would that, O stranger, the son of Saturn may bring <lb/>
            this word to pass: thou shouldst know what my power and <lb/>
            hands are."</p>
          <p>In like manner Eumæus prayed to all the gods, that wise <lb/>
            Ulysses should return to his own home.</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke such things to one another. But the <lb/>
            suitors were preparing death and fate for Telemachus; but a <lb/>
            bird flew on their left hand, a high-flying eagle, and it held a <lb/>
            timid dove. But Amphinomus harangued and addressed <lb/>
            them :</p>
          <p>" O friends, this plan, the death of Telemachus, will not <lb/>
            succeed for us; but let us be mindful of the feast."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Amphinomus; and his words pleased them. <lb/>
            But coming to the house of divine Ulysses, they spread cloaks <lb/>
            upon the benches and the thrones: and they sacrificed large <lb/>
            sheep and fat goats, and they sacrificed fatted swine and a <lb/>
            cow from the herd : and having roasted the entrails, they dis­ <lb/>
            tributed them: but they mixed wine in the bowls; and the <lb/>
            swineherd distributed the cups. Then Philætius. chief of <lb/>
            men, distributed bread to them in beautiful baskets; and <lb/>
            Melanthius poured out wine. But they stretched forth their <lb/>
            hands to the food lying ready before them. And Telemachus, <lb/>
            considering what was profitable, placed Ulysses within the <lb/>
            well-built palace, near the stone threshold, putting an un­ <lb/>
            seemly seat near, and a small table; and near him he placed <lb/>
            a share of the entrails, and poured wine in a golden cup, and <lb/>
            addressed discourse to him :</p>
          <p>" Sit here now, drinking wine amongst the men ; but <lb/>
            will ward off from thee the scoffings and the hands of all the <lb/>
            suitors; since this house is by no means public, but belonging <lb/>
            to Ulysses: and he obtained it for me. But do ye, O suitors, <lb/>
            restrain your mind and hands from offending lest some strife <lb/>
            and contention should arise."</p><pb n="281"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="268-306."/>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but they all gnashing with their teeth in <lb/>
            their lips, marvelled at Telemachus, for that he boldly spoke. <lb/>
            And Antinous, son of Eupithes, addressed them:</p>
          <p>" Let us put up with the language of Telemachus, O Gre­ <lb/>
            cians, although it is severe: he speaks, threatening us very <lb/>
            much. For Jove, the son of Saturn, did not suffer us, other­ <lb/>
            wise we should already have stopped him in the palace, al­ <lb/>
            though he is a sharp speaker."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Antinous ; but he did not regard his words. <lb/>
            And the heralds brought a sacred hecatomb of the gods <lb/>
            through the city; and the long-haired Grecians were as­ <lb/>
            sembled under the shady grove of far-darting Apollo: but <lb/>
            when they had roasted the upper flesh, and had drawn it out, <lb/>
            having divided the shares they made a most delightful feast. <lb/>
            And those who served, set an equal share near to Ulysses, <lb/>
            as they themselves were allotted: for so Telemachus, dear <lb/>
            son of divine Ulysses, commanded them. But Minerva did <lb/>
            not suffer the haughty suitors altogether to refrain from <lb/>
            mind-grieving insolence: that sorrow might still more come <lb/>
            upon Ulysses, son of Laertes, in his heart. And there was a <lb/>
            certain man amongst the suitors, who was acquainted with <lb/>
            lawless deeds, his name was Ctesippus, and he inhabited a <lb/>
            house in Samos; who, trusting in the possessions of his <lb/>
            father, wooed the wife of long-absent Ulysses: he then ad­ <lb/>
            dressed the overbearing suitors:</p>
          <p>Hear me, noble suitors, whilst I speak something: the <lb/>
            stranger, forsooth, of old has an equal share, as it seems; <lb/>
            for it is not honourable or just to sadden the guests of Tele­ <lb/>
            machus, whoever comes to this house. But come, I also will <lb/>
            give him a hospitable present; that he himself also may give <lb/>
            a reward either to the bath-keeper, or to any other of the serv­ <lb/>
            ants, who are in the house of divine Ulysses."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, with his strong hand he threw the <lb/>
            foot of an ox, which was lying near, taking it from the <lb/>
            basket: but Ulysses avoided it, gently bending his head: and <lb/>
            he smiled in his mind with a very Sardonic smile; but he <lb/>
            struck the well-built wall: and Telemachus chided Ctesippus <lb/>
            in words:</p>
          <p>" O Ctesippus, truly this was very much better for thee, in <lb/>
            thy mind ; [that] thou didst not hit the stranger: for be <lb/>
            avoided the blow; for I would certainly have struck thee in <pb n="282"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="306-345."/> <lb/>
            the middle with a sharp spear. and thy father would have <lb/>
            been occupied about burial here for thee instead of marriage: <lb/>
            therefore let not any one show unseemly behaviour to me in <lb/>
            mine house; for I now understand and know every thing, <lb/>
            both good and bad : but before I was still a child. But, how­ <lb/>
            ever we have endured to see these things, when our sheep <lb/>
            were killed, and our wine drunk, and our bread [eat]:5 for <lb/>
            it is difficult for one to hinder many. But come, no more do <lb/>
            evil things to me, being hostile to me; but if thou now de­ <lb/>
            sirest to slay me myself with the brass, I would even wish it, <lb/>
            and it would be much better to die, than for ever to behold <lb/>
            these unseemly deeds, strangers treated disgracefully, and men <lb/>
            dragging women-servants in an unseemly way through the <lb/>
            beautiful palace."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but they were all mute in silence. But <lb/>
            Agelaus, son of Damastor, at length addressed them:</p>
          <p>" My friends, no one surely, chiding with opposing words, <lb/>
            would be angry with what has been justly spoken. Neither <lb/>
            insult the stranger any more, nor any other of the servants, who <lb/>
            are in the house of divine Ulysses. But I would fain speak <lb/>
            a kind word to Telemachus and his mother, if it would please <lb/>
            them both in their hearts. As long as our mind expected in our <lb/>
            breasts that wise Ulysses would return to his own home, so <lb/>
            long there was no blame for her to remain, and restrain the <lb/>
            suitors in the house: (since this was better, if Ulysses re­ <lb/>
            turned, and on his return reached his house:) but this is now <lb/>
            evident, that he is no longer able to return. But come, sit­ <lb/>
            ting near thy mother, tell her this, to marry whatsoever man <lb/>
            is best, and will give her the most [bridal presents] : that thou <lb/>
            rejoicing mayest manage all thy paternal property, eating and <lb/>
            drinking : and she may come to the house of another."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn: "No, by <lb/>
            Jove, O Agelaus, and the griefs of my father, who has either <lb/>
            perished or is wandering some where far away from Ithaca, I <lb/>
            do not delay the marriage of my mother; but I order her to <lb/>
            marry whomsoever she chooses, and who gives her abundant <lb/>
            presents. But I am ashamed to thrust her from the palace <lb/>
            against her will with a violent word ; may not God bring this <lb/>
            to pass."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Telemachus; but Pallas Minerva raised in­ <note type="footnote"> * Observe the zeugma. </note> <pb n="283"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="346-380."/> <lb/>
            extinguishable laughter amongst the suitors, and made their <lb/>
            thoughts wander. And they now laughed with other men's <lb/>
            jaws ;6 and they eat meat polluted with blood: and their eyes <lb/>
            were filled with tears ; and their mind thought of grief. And <lb/>
            godlike Theoclymenus addressed them:</p>
          <p>" Ah wretched ones; what evil is this ye are suffering ? <lb/>
            your heads and faces and knees below are involved in night. <lb/>
            And mourning has burst forth ; and your cheeks are wet with <lb/>
            tears: and the walls and beautiful intercolumniations are be­ <lb/>
            sprinkled with blood. And the portico is full, and the hall <lb/>
            also is full of images, that are going under darkness to Ere­ <lb/>
            bus : and the sun has died away from heaven, and evil <lb/>
            murkiness has run around us."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but they all laughed pleasantly at him, but <lb/>
            Eurymachus, son of Polybus, began to address them :</p>
          <p>" The stranger is silly, having lately come from elsewhere : <lb/>
            but, O youths, send him quickly out of the house through the <lb/>
            door to go to the forum; since he likens these things to the <lb/>
            night," 7</p>
          <p>But him godlike Theoclymenus addressed in turn: " O <lb/>
            Eurymachus, I by no means desire thee to give me conductors: <lb/>
            I have eyes, and ears, and both my feet, and a mind made not <lb/>
            at all unseemly in my breast: with these will I go out of <lb/>
            doors, since I perceive that evil is coming on you, which no <lb/>
            one of the suitors will escape or avoid, [of you,] who insult­ <lb/>
            in- men, in the house of godlike Ulysses, are contriving im­ <lb/>
            pious things."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he went out of the well-built house: <lb/>
            and he came to Piræus, who willingly received him. But all <lb/>
            the suitors, looking at one another, irritated Telemachus, <lb/>
            laughing at the strangers; and thus some one of the haughty <lb/>
            youths spoke:</p>
          <p>" O Telemachus, there is no one else that has worse guests <lb/>
            than thou: what a begging8 vagabond this is whom thou hast, <lb/>
            in want of bread and wine: not at all skilled in works, nor <lb/>
            strong, and to no purpose a burden of the earth. This other <note type="footnote"> 6 i. e. not with an honest, hearty laugh, but with a laugh that seemed <lb/>

          <p>Thus spoke the suitors ; but he did not regard their words; <lb/>
            but silently looked towards his father, always expecting, when <lb/>
            he should at length lay his hands upon the shameless suitors. <lb/>
            But prudent Penelope, daughter of Icarus, placing a very <lb/>
            beautiful seat opposite, heard the words of each of the men <lb/>
            in the palace. They however laughing, prepared a feast, <lb/>
            pleasant, and gratifying to the mind, since they had sacrificed <lb/>
            very many things : but there could not be another more un­ <lb/>
            grateful feast, [than that] which the goddess and the noble <lb/>
            man were soon about to make ; for they first contrived un­ <lb/>
            seemly things.</p>

          <p>Penelope proposes to the suitors to contend for her hand with the bow and <lb/>
            arrows of Ulysses. They make vain attempts to bend the bow, but <lb/>
            Ulysses, calling Eumæus and Philætius aside, orders them to shut the <lb/>
            doors, and desires Eumæus to give the bow to him. After some opposi­ <lb/>
            tion from the suitors, he obtains it, and shoots an arrow through the <lb/>
            twelve rings erected for the occasion.</p>
          <p>AND then the blue-eyed goddess Minerva put it in the mind <lb/>
            of prudent Penelope, daughter of Icarus, to place the bow <lb/>
            and the hoary steel for the suitors in the palace of Ulysses <lb/>
            as a subject of contest and a beginning of slaughter.1 And <lb/>
            she ascended the lofty stairs of the house; and in her plump2 <lb/>
            hand took a well-bent key, beautiful, of brass: and upon it <lb/>
            was a handle of ivory: and she hastened to the farthest <lb/>
            chamber with her women attendants ; where lay the treasures <lb/>
            of the king, both brass, and gold, and much-wrought steel. <lb/>
            There lay the unstrung3 bow, and an arrow-containing quiver, <note type="footnote"> I " Not so from the design of Penelope, but of Minerva, ut inde fieret <lb/>

            and there were many grievous shafts in it: presents, which a <lb/>
            stranger meeting him in Lacedæmon gave him, Iphitus, son <lb/>
            of Eurytus, like unto the immortals. But they met one an­ <lb/>
            other in Messene, in the house of warlike Orsilochus: Ulysses <lb/>
            indeed came after a debt, which the whole people owed to <lb/>
            him: for Messenian men had taken away from Ithaca three <lb/>
            hundred sheep, and their shepherds, in many-benched ships. <lb/>
            On account of these Ulysses came a long voyage, on a public <lb/>
            mission being yet a boy: for his father and the other chiefs <lb/>
            sent him on. But Iphitus [came] to seek the horses which <lb/>
            he had. lost, twelve mares, and under them hard-working <lb/>
            mules, which soon became death and fate for him: since he <lb/>
            came to the noble-minded son of Jove, the hero Hercules, <lb/>
            skilled in mighty deeds; who slew him, although being his <lb/>
            guest in his own house; wretched one, nor did he reverence <lb/>
            the anger of the gods, nor the table, which he placed near <lb/>
            him : but afterwards he also killed himself: and himself kept <lb/>
            the solid-hoofed steeds in his palace. Asking for them lie <lb/>
            met Ulysses, and gave him a bow which mighty Eurytus be­ <lb/>
            fore bore, but he, dying in his lofty house, left it to his son. <lb/>
            But to him Ulysses gave a sharp sword and a strong spear, <lb/>
            a beginning of kindly hospitality, nor did they know one an­ <lb/>
            other's table: for the son of Jove first slew Iphitus, son of <lb/>
            Eurytus, like unto the immortals; he gave him the bow; but <lb/>
            divine Ulysses did not take it, when going to the war on the <lb/>
            black ships; but there it lay as a memorial of the kind <lb/>
            stranger in the palace: and he carried it over his own land.</p>
          <p>But when the divine one of women now reached the cham­ <lb/>
            ber, and came to the oaken threshold, which once an artificer <lb/>
            polished skilfully, and made straight according to the rule, <lb/>
            and in it fitted pillars, and upon it placed shining doors: im­ <lb/>
            mediately then she quickly loosed the thong of the ring, and <lb/>
            put in the key, and struck back the bolts of the door, taking <lb/>
            aim opposite to them: and they resounded, like as a bull pas­ <lb/>
            turing in a meadow : so many beautiful doors stricken with <lb/>
            the key resounded, and they were quickly opened to her. And <lb/>
            she then went upon the lofty floor, where stood the chests, <lb/>
            and in them lay perfumed garments. From thence stretching <lb/>
            out, she took down the bow from the peg, with the bow-case <note type="footnote"> 4 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξεσία, ἡ δημοσια πϱεσβεία</foreign>, Eustathius, who compares <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξεσις</foreign> in He­ <lb/>

            itself, which shining surrounded it. And then sitting down <lb/>
            there, placing it on her knees, she wept very shrilly; and she <lb/>
            took out the bow of the king. But when she was satiated <lb/>
            with tearful grief, she proceeded to the palace, to the illustri­ <lb/>
            ous suitors, holding the unstrung bow in her hand, and the <lb/>
            arrow-containing quiver ; and in it there were many grievous <lb/>
            shafts. And her handmaidens brought a chest with her; where­ <lb/>
            in lay much steel and brass, prizes of her king. But when <lb/>
            the divine one of women came to the suitors, she stood near <lb/>
            the pillar of the stoutly-made roof, holding up a slender veil <lb/>
            before her cheeks : [and a prudent handmaiden stood near her <lb/>
            on each side :] and she immediately addressed the suitors, and <lb/>
            spoke:</p>
          <p>" Hear me, ye noble suitors, who press heavily upon this <lb/>
            house to eat and drink without ceasing, my husband being ab­ <lb/>
            sent for a long time ; nor have ye been able to make any other <lb/>
            pretext for your sedition,5 but as desiring to marry me, and <lb/>
            make me your wife. But come, suitors, since this contest has <lb/>
            appeared ; for I will put down the great bow of divine <lb/>
            Ulysses, and whoever shall most easily stretch the bow in his <lb/>
            hands, and shall dart an arrow through the whole twelve <lb/>
            hatchets, him will I follow, leaving this house which I entered <lb/>
            when a virgin, very beautiful, full of the means of liveli­ <lb/>
            hood: which I think I shall sometime remember, even in a <lb/>
            dream."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke; and she ordered the divine swineherd, <lb/>
            Eurnæus, to place the bow and the hoary steel for the suitors. <lb/>
            But weeping Eumæus received it and laid it down: and the <lb/>
            herdsman wept from the other side, when he beheld the bow <lb/>
            of his master, but Antinous chided [them], and spoke and ad­ <lb/>
            dressed them:</p>
          <p>" Foolish countrymen, who think upon things of a day, ye <lb/>
            wretched pair, why now do ye shed a tear, and excite the <lb/>
            lady's mind in her breast? whose mind even otherwise lies in <lb/>
            grief, since she has lost her dear husband. But feast in silence, <note type="footnote"> 5 I am unwilling to desert the authority of Eustathius, A poll. Lex. p. 464, <lb/>

            sitting down, or going out of doors, weep, leaving the bow <lb/>
            there, no despicable6 contest for the suitors: for I do not think <lb/>
            they will easily stretch this well-polished bow. For there <lb/>
            is not such a man amongst all these, as Ulysses was; and I <lb/>
            myself saw him,—for I am able to remember,—but I was <lb/>
            still a child."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but his mind hoped in his breast, that he <lb/>
            would [be able to] stretch the string, and dart an arrow <lb/>
            through the steel. He however was the first to taste the <lb/>
            arrow from the hands of blameless Ulysses, whom he once <lb/>
            dishonoured, sitting in the palace, and excited all his com­ <lb/>
            panions against him. And the sacred might of Telemachus <lb/>
            addressed them:</p>
          <p>" Alas ! truly bath Jove, the son of Saturn, made me fool­ <lb/>
            ish. My dear mother, although she is prudent, says, that she <lb/>
            will follow another, leaving this house: but I laugh, and am <lb/>
            delighted in my foolish mind. But come, suitors, since this <lb/>
            contest has appeared, there is not such a woman now in the <lb/>
            Grecian land, nor in sacred Pylos, nor in Argos, nor Mycene, <lb/>
            [nor Ithaca itself, nor black Epirus,] and ye yourselves know <lb/>
            this ; why need I praise my mother ? But come, do not draw <lb/>
            aside with pretext, nor turn any more away a long time from <lb/>
            the stretching of the bow, that we may see you. And I my­ <lb/>
            self would try the bow ; but if I shall stretch it, and dart an <lb/>
            arrow through the steel, my venerable mother, going with <lb/>
            another, should not leave this house for me sorrowing, when <lb/>
            I am left behind, able even now to obtain the glorious prizes <lb/>
            of my sire."</p>
          <p>He spoke ; and rushing upright, he put his purple cloak off <lb/>
            his shoulders ; and put his sharp sword from off his shoulders. <lb/>
            First indeed he placed the hatchets, digging one long trench <lb/>
            for all, and he directed it according to a rule; and he stamped <lb/>
            in the earth about them: but astonishment possessed all, <lb/>
            seeing how orderly he placed them; and be never before had <lb/>
            seen them. And he stood, going upon the threshold, and <lb/>
            tried the bow : thrice he bent it, anxious to draw it, but thrice <lb/>
            he let go the bow, hoping this in his mind, that he would [be <lb/>
            able to] stretch the string, and dart an arrow through the <note type="footnote"> 6 I have followed Buttmann, Lexil. p. 4, 7, whose discussion of the <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="128-167"/> <lb/>
            steel. And now he would have stretched it by force, drawing <lb/>
            it a fourth time, but Ulysses nodded to restrain him, although <lb/>
            eager. And the sacred might of Telemachus addressed them :</p>
          <p>" Alas ! I shall either hereafter be a coward and weak, or <lb/>
            I am younger, and do not yet trust in my hands to ward off a <lb/>
            man, when any one first provokes me. But come, you who <lb/>
            are better than me in strength, try the bow, and let us end the <lb/>
            contest."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he laid the bow from him upon the <lb/>
            ground, reclining it against the well-polished glued panels : <lb/>
            and he reclined the swift weapon there against its beautiful <lb/>
            tip.8 And he sat down again on the throne, from whence he <lb/>
            arose. But Antinous, son of Eupithes, addressed them :</p>
          <p>"Rise in order to the right, all of you, beginning from the <lb/>
            place from whence the wine-pourer begins."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Antinous, and his words pleased them. But <lb/>
            Leiodes, son of Ænops, rose first, who was their soothsayer, <lb/>
            and sat always inmost near the golden bowl : but wicked <lb/>
            deeds were hateful to him alone, and he was indignant at all <lb/>
            the suitors : he then first took the bow and the sharp shaft ; <lb/>
            and he stood, going on the threshold, and tried the bow ; nor <lb/>
            did he stretch it ; for he first wearied his hands, drawing it, <lb/>
            they being unpractised and tender, and he addressed the <lb/>
            suitors :</p>
          <p>" O friends, I cannot stretch it ; but let another also take <lb/>
            it ; for this bow will deprive many chieftains of their mind <lb/>
            and soul : since it is much better to die, than living to fail of <lb/>
            [the prize], on account of which we are always assembled <lb/>
            here, waiting all our days. Now indeed some one hopes in <lb/>
            his mind and meditates to marry Penelope, the wife of Ulysses, <lb/>
            but when he shall try the bow, and see it, then let him woo <lb/>
            some other of the well-clad Grecian women, seeking her with <lb/>
            bridal gifts ; and let her then marry whoever gives her most <lb/>
            [bridal gifts], and comes destined to her."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, and placed the bow from him, reclining it <lb/>
            against the well-polished glued panels, and he reclined the <lb/>
            swift weapon there against its beautiful tip ; and he sat down <lb/>
            again on his seat, from whence he arose. But Antinous chided <lb/>
            him, and spoke a word and addressed him : <note type="footnote"> <unclear>I</unclear> Enstathius interprets <foreign xml:lang="grc">κϱώνη</foreign>, either by rb <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ τόξου ἄκϱον</foreign>, or TO rij( <lb/>

          <p>" O Leiodes, what word has escaped thy lips, terrible and <lb/>
            grievous? I am indignant at hearing it, if this bow shall in <lb/>
            truth deprive the chieftains of their mind and soul; since thou <lb/>
            canst not stretch it. For thy venerable mother did not bring <lb/>
            thee forth such a one as to be a drawer of the bow and arrows ; <lb/>
            but other noble suitors will soon stretch it."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and he commanded Melanthius the goat­ <lb/>
            herd: " Hasten now, light a fire in the palace, O Melanthius, <lb/>
            and near it place both a large seat, and skins upon it, and <lb/>
            bring out a large roll of suet, which is within, that we young <lb/>
            men, warming it,9 anointing it with fat, may try the bow, and <lb/>
            end the contest.</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and Melanthius immediately lighted the <lb/>
            unwearied fire; and bringing a seat, he placed it near, and <lb/>
            skins upon it, and he brought out a large roll of suet, which <lb/>
            was within, with which the young men, having warmed it, <lb/>
            tried it: nor could they stretch it, for they were very deficient <lb/>
            in strength. But Antinous still persisted, and godlike Eury­ <lb/>
            machus, chiefs among the suitors: and they were far the best <lb/>
            in excellence. But the herdsman and the swineherd of divine <lb/>
            Ulysses went out of the house, both going together. And <lb/>
            after them divine Ulysses went out of the house. But when <lb/>
            they were now out of the gates, and the court, addressing them <lb/>
            he spoke to them in mild words :</p>
          <p>" O herdsman, and thou, swineherd, shall I tell some news, <lb/>
            or shall I myself conceal it ? but my mind incites me to speak. <lb/>
            What kind of men would ye be to defend Ulysses, if he should <lb/>
            come from any where very suddenly, and some god should <lb/>
            bring him ? would ye assist the suitors of Ulysses ? Tell me, <lb/>
            in what way your heart and mind commands you.''</p>
          <p>But him the herdsman of oxen addressed in turn : " C <lb/>
            father Jove, would that thou wouldst accomplish this wish, <lb/>
            so should that man come, and the deity should bring him <lb/>
            thou shouldst know what my power and hands are."</p>
          <p>In like manner Eumæus prayed to all the gods, that wise <lb/>
            Ulysses should return to his own home. But when he knew <lb/>
            their true disposition, immediately answering them with words, <lb/>
            he addressed them:</p>
          <p>" Within indeed here am I myself, having suffered many <lb/>
            evils, I have come in the twentieth year to my paternal land. <note type="footnote"> 9 i. e. the bow </note> <note type="footnote"> U </note> <pb n="290"/>

            And I know how I am come welcome to you only of the serv­ <lb/>
            ants : but I have not heard any one of the others praying that <lb/>
            I should again come returning home. But TO you I will tell <lb/>
            the truth, how it shall be. If God subdues the noble suitors <lb/>
            under me, I will bring wives for both of you, and will bestow <lb/>
            possessions, and houses built near mine ; and afterwards ye <lb/>
            shall be the two companions and brothers of Telemachus. <lb/>
            Come, I will now show you some other plain sign, (that ye <lb/>
            may know me well, and be confirmed by a testimony in your <lb/>
            mind,) the scar which once a boar inflicted on me with its <lb/>
            white tusk, when I went to Parnassus, with the sons of Au­ <lb/>
            tolychus."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he drew back the rags from the great <lb/>
            scar. But they, when they had beheld it, and had well ascer­ <lb/>
            tained every thing, wept, throwing their hands around wise <lb/>
            Ulysses, and embracing him, they kissed both his head and <lb/>
            shoulders. In like manner Ulysses kissed their heads and <lb/>
            hands. And the sun would have set whilst they were weep­ <lb/>
            ing, had not Ulysses himself restrained them and spoke:</p>
          <p>" Cease from weeping and mourning; lest any one coming <lb/>
            out of the palace should see us, and should tell it also within. <lb/>
            But enter one after another, not all together; first I, and <lb/>
            afterwards you: but let this sign be made; all the others <lb/>
            indeed, as many as are noble suitors, will not suffer you to <lb/>
            give me the bow and quiver; but do thou, O divine Eu­ <lb/>
            mæus, bringing the bow through the palace, place it for me <lb/>
            in my hands: and tell the women to lock the closely-fitted <lb/>
            doors of the palace. But if any one should hear either a <lb/>
            groaning or a noise within, of the men in our courts, let them <lb/>
            not advance out of doors, but remain there in silence at their <lb/>
            work. But to thee, O divine Philætius, I give in charge to <lb/>
            lock with a key the gates of the court, and quickly put the <lb/>
            chain over it." 10</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he entered the well-built house : then he <lb/>
            went and sat down upon the seat, from whence he had arisen : <lb/>
            and the servants of divine Ulysses also went in. But Eury­ <lb/>
            machus was now moving the bow about in his hands, warm­ <lb/>
            ing it on both sides with the flame of fire; but even so lie <note type="footnote"> 10 " The <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεσμὸς</foreign> seems to have been a strap designed to close the only <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="247—286."/> <lb/>
            could not stretch it; and his glory-seeking heart groaned <lb/>
            greatly, and mourning he then spoke and said :</p>
          <p>" Alas! truly there is grief for me both about myself, and <lb/>
            ab.out all: I do not so much lament concerning the marriage, <lb/>
            although sorrowing: there are also many other Grecian <lb/>
            women, both in sea-girt Ithaca itself, and in other cities; but <lb/>
            if we are indeed so much inferior in strength to godlike <lb/>
            Ulysses, that we cannot stretch the bow ; a disgrace even for <lb/>
            posterity to hear."</p>
          <p>But him Antinous, son of Eupithes, addressed in turn : " O <lb/>
            Eurymachus, it will not be so ; and thou thyself also knowest <lb/>
            it. For now there is a holy feast of the god" amongst <lb/>
            the people; and who could stretch the bow? but lay it aside <lb/>
            quietly: and let us also suffer all the hatchets to stand, for I <lb/>
            think not that any one will take them away, entering the <lb/>
            palace of Ulysses, son of Laertes. But come, let the wine- <lb/>
            pourer make the first offerings with the cups, that having <lb/>
            made libations we may lay aside the crooked bow. But in <lb/>
            the morning desire Melanthius the goatherd, to bring goats, <lb/>
            far the best in all the flocks, that offering thighs to bow­ <lb/>
            renowned Apollo, we may try the bow, and end the contest."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Antinous ; and his discourse pleased them. <lb/>
            And the heralds poured water upon their hands, and youths <lb/>
            crowned the bowls with wine; and they distributed to all, <lb/>
            having made the first offerings with the cups. But when <lb/>
            they had made libations, and drunk as much as their mind <lb/>
            wished, much-planning Ulysses, devising a stratagem, ad­ <lb/>
            dressed them:</p>
          <p>" Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious queen, [while I <lb/>
            speak the things which the mind in my breast desires mel. <lb/>
            But I especially beseech Eurymachus and godlike Antinous, <lb/>
            since he has spoken this word rightly : now indeed cease <lb/>
            from the bow, and commit it to the gods: but in the morn­ <lb/>
            ing the deity will give strength to whom he is willing. But <lb/>
            come, give me the well-polished bow, that I may try my <lb/>
            hands and strength with you, if I have still the strength, <lb/>
            such as I before had in my bending limbs, or whether now <lb/>
            my wandering and want of care has destroyed it for me."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but they all were exceedingly indignant, <lb/>
            dreading lest he should stretch the well-polished bow. And <note type="footnote"> 11 Apollo. </note> <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <pb n="292"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="287—825"/> <lb/>
            Antinous chided him, and spoke a word, and addressed <lb/>
            him:</p>
          <p>"Ah wretched one of strangers ! thou hast not even a little <lb/>
            understanding ; art thou not content, that thou feastest quietly <lb/>
            amongst us most12 noble men ? nor art thou at all deprived of <lb/>
            the banquet, but thou hearest our words and conversation : <lb/>
            nor does any other stranger and beggar hear our discourse. <lb/>
            Sweet wine hurts thee, which harms others also, whoever <lb/>
            takes it too abundantly, nor drinks properly. Wine also in­ <lb/>
            spired the illustrious Centaur Eurytion in the palace of <lb/>
            magnanimous Pirithous, when he came to the Lapithæ : but <lb/>
            he, when he had injured his mind with wine, in madness did <lb/>
            wicked deeds in the house of Pirithous : but grief seized upon <lb/>
            the heroes, and rushing upon them, they dragged them out of <lb/>
            doors through the vestibule, having cut off their ears and <lb/>
            nostrils with the sharp brass; but he, injured in his feelings, <lb/>
            went about, enduring that calamity with a frantic mind, <lb/>
            from whence there was strife between the Centaurs and men, <lb/>
            for overcome with wine he brought the evil upon himself <lb/>
            first. So also I declare great mischief to thee, if thou stretch­ <lb/>
            est the bow: for thou wilt not meet with any defence in our <lb/>
            house, but we will soon send thee in a black ship to king <lb/>
            Echetus, who injures all mortals ; and thou wilt not be saved <lb/>
            from thence. But drink quietly, nor contend with younger <lb/>
            men."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn: " O Anti­ <lb/>
            nons, it is not indeed honourable or just to vex the guests of <lb/>
            Telemachus, whoever comes to this house. Dost thou expect, <lb/>
            if the stranger should bend the great bow of Ulysses, trusting <lb/>
            in his hands and his own might, that he would lead me home, <lb/>
            and make me his wife? He did not himself ever hope this in <lb/>
            his breast. Nor let any one of you, on that account grieving <lb/>
            his mind, banquet here; since indeed it is not fit.,,</p>
          <p>But her Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered in turn: <lb/>
            " O prudent Penelope, daughter of Icarus, we do not think <lb/>
            that he will carry thee home; nor is it likely: but being <lb/>
            ashamed of the rumour of men and women, lest at some <lb/>
            time some other of the Grecians who is worse should say, <lb/>
            Very inferior men indeed woo the wife of a blameless man; <note type="footnote"> 12 Observe this sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερφιάλοισι</foreign>. See Buttm Lex. p. 414 </note> <pb n="293"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="326—364."/> <lb/>
            since they cannot bend the well-polished bow. But some <lb/>
            other beggar man coming as a wanderer, easily bent the bow, <lb/>
            and sent [the arrow] through the steel. Thus they will <lb/>
            speak ; but these things would be reproaches to us."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn : " O Eury­ <lb/>
            machus, it is not possible that they should be glorious amongst <lb/>
            the people, who consume the property of an excellent man, <lb/>
            doing him wrong. Why do ye bring these reproaches upon <lb/>
            yourselves ? But this stranger is very mighty [in stature] and <lb/>
            well-compacted, and in race he boasts himself to be the son or <lb/>
            a good man. But come, give to him the well-polished bow, <lb/>
            that we may see: for thus I tell you, and this shall be per­ <lb/>
            formed ; if he should bend it, and Apollo should give him <lb/>
            glory, I will put a cloak on him, and a tunic, beautiful <lb/>
            garments. And I will give to him a sharp javelin, to ward <lb/>
            off dogs and men, and a double-edged sword: and I will give <lb/>
            him sandals under his feet, and will send him, wherever his <lb/>
            heart and mind desires him."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Telemachus answered in turn; " O my <lb/>
            mother, no one of the Grecians i3 better than me, to give and <lb/>
            refuse the bow, to whom I am willing: neither as many as <lb/>
            rule over rugged Ithaca, nor as many as [rule] in the islands <lb/>
            of horse-feeding Elis. Of these no one shall force me <lb/>
            against my will, if I choose even to give the bow altogether <lb/>
            to the stranger, to take away. But going into the house, <lb/>
            take care of thine own works, the web, and the distaff, and <lb/>
            desire thy handmaidens to hasten their work: but the bow <lb/>
            shall be a care to all men, but especially mine: for the power <lb/>
            in the house is mine."</p>
          <p>She indeed astonished went back again into the house; for <lb/>
            she laid up in her mind the prudent discourse of her son. <lb/>
            And ascending to the upper room, with her women attend­ <lb/>
            ants, she then bewailed Ulysses, her dear husband; until <lb/>
            blue-eyed Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eye-lids. But <lb/>
            the divine swineherd taking the bow, carried it; and all the <lb/>
            suitors in the palace chided him ; and thus some one of the <lb/>
            proud youths spoke:</p>
          <p>" Where now art thou bearing the crooked bow, O un­ <lb/>
            enviable swineherd, wandering fellow ? The swift dogs which <lb/>
            thou hast nourished over thy swine shall soon consume thee <pb n="294"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="365—401."/> <lb/>
            away from men, if Apollo and the other immortal gods are <lb/>
            propitious to us."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke; but he taking them, laid them in their <lb/>
            place, fearing, because many in the palace chided him. But <lb/>
            Telemachus from the other side cried out threatening:</p>
          <p>" Friend, bear the bow forward ; (perchance thou wilt not <lb/>
            obey all with advantage;) lest I, although younger, should <lb/>
            drive you to the country, pelting thee with stones; for I <lb/>
            Rill thy superior in strength. For would that I were so much <lb/>
            superior to all the suitors, as many as are in the house, in my <lb/>
            hands and strength; then would I soon send some one in a <lb/>
            sad way to depart from my house; since they devise evil <lb/>
            things."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, but all the suitors laughed pleasantly at him ; <lb/>
            and relaxed their severe anger against Telemachus: but the <lb/>
            swineherd taking the bow through the house, standing near to <lb/>
            warlike Ulysses, placed it in his hands. And calling her <lb/>
            aside he addressed the nurse Euryclea:</p>
          <p>" Telemachus desires thee, O prudent Euryclea, to lock the <lb/>
            closely-fitted doors of the palace. And if any one should <lb/>
            hear a groaning or a noise within in our courts, let them <lb/>
            not advance out of doors, but keep there in silence at their <lb/>
            work."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but the word was unwinged: and she <lb/>
            locked the doors of the well-built palace. And Philætius <lb/>
            leaped out of doors in silence from the house, and then he <lb/>
            locked the gates of the well-enclosed court. But there lay <lb/>
            under the portico a rope of a ship rowed on both sides, made <lb/>
            of the tree Byblos, with which he secured the gates, and him­ <lb/>
            self went in. Then going he sat down upon the seat from <lb/>
            whence he had arisen, looking at Ulysses: but he was now <lb/>
            handling the bow, turning it up on all sides, trying it on one <lb/>
            side and the other, for fear worms had eaten the horn, whilst <lb/>
            the king was absent. And thus some one said, looking at <lb/>
            another near him:</p>
          <p>" Surely he is some admirer or stealer of bows, or he has <lb/>
            such a one of his own at home, or he desires to make it: so <lb/>
            much does the wanderer, skilled in evils, turn it in his hands <lb/>
            on this side and that."</p>
          <p>But another of the proud youths spoke in turn: " Would <pb n="295"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="402-434."/> <lb/>
            that he may meet with so much profit, as lie will some time <lb/>
            or other be able to bend this." 13</p>
          <p>Thus spoke the suitors ; but much-planning Ulysses, as soon <lb/>
            as he handled the large bow, and looked at it upon all sides, <lb/>
            as when a man skilled in the harp and in song easily stretches <lb/>
            a cord upon a new pin, joining on both sides the well-twisted <lb/>
            entrail of a sheep; so did Ulysses bend the great bow without <lb/>
            difficulty. But with his right he laid hold of the string and <lb/>
            tried it; and it twanged beautifully, like unto a swallow In <lb/>
            voice. But great grief came upon the suitors, and the colour <lb/>
            of all changed: but Jove thundered loudly, showing fortl <lb/>
            signs. Then much-enduring divine Ulysses rejoiced, because <lb/>
            the son of wily-counselling Saturn had sent him an omen. And <lb/>
            he took a swift arrow, which lay near him on the table, naked : <lb/>
            but the others lay within the hollow quiver, which the Gre­ <lb/>
            cians were soon about to experience. Taking it upon his <lb/>
            elbow, he drew the string, and the notch [of the arrow], from <lb/>
            thence, sitting on his seat; and he sent forth the arrow, aim­ <lb/>
            ing opposite; but he did not miss all the hatchets from the <lb/>
            first ring,14 and the brass-tipped arrow came entirely through <lb/>
            the door ; but he addressed Telemachus :</p>
          <p>" O Telemachus, the stranger sitting in the palace does not <lb/>
            disgrace thee; I have not at all missed the mark, nor did I <lb/>
            labour for along time stretching the bow: still is my strength <lb/>
            firm ; not even thus do the suitors, dishonouring me, blame me. <lb/>
            But now it is time for the Grecians to prepare a supper in the <lb/>
            light, but then also to be otherwise rejoiced15 with the song <lb/>
            and harp: for these are the adornments of a feast."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and nodded with his brows ; but Telemachus, the <lb/>
            dear son of divine Ulysses, girt his sharp sword around him: <lb/>
            and he threw his hand round his spear; and stood by him near <lb/>
            his seat, armed with shining brass. <note type="footnote"> 13 i. e. as there is chance of his doing so, spoken ironically. </note><note type="footnote"> 14 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Στειλειὴ</foreign> signifies that part of a hatchet in which the handle is in­ <lb/>

          <p>Ulysses, with the aid of Telemachus, Eumæus and Philætius, slays all the <lb/>
            suitors: and twelve of the female servants who had had intercourse with <lb/>
            the suitors, are hanged by Telemachus and the herdsman. Melanthius <lb/>
            is also killed with greater torments. The herald Medon and the bard <lb/>
            Phemius only are saved.</p>
          <p>BUT much-planning Ulysses stripped himself of his rags, 1 <lb/>
            and leaped upon the large threshold, holding the bow, and the <lb/>
            quiver full of arrows: and he poured out the swift arrows <lb/>
            there before his feet; and addressed the suitors:</p>
          <p>" This decisive2 contest has at length been accomplished: <lb/>
            but now I will see whether I can hit3 another mark, which no <lb/>
            man as yet has struck, but may Apollo give me glory."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and directed the bitter arrow against Antinous. <lb/>
            He indeed was about to take up a beautiful cup, golden, with <lb/>
            two ears ; and he was now handling it with his hands, that he <lb/>
            might drink of wine: but slaughter was not a care to him in <lb/>
            his mind ; (who, forsooth, would think amongst men banquet­ <lb/>
            in-, that one alone amongst greater numbers, although very <lb/>
            strong, would prepare evil death and black fate for him ?) <lb/>
            But Ulysses catching him on the throat, struck him with the <lb/>
            shaft: and the point came right through his tender neck. <lb/>
            And he was rolled to the other side, and the cup fell from the <lb/>
            hand of him stricken : and immediately a thick channel of hu­ <lb/>
            man gore came through his nostrils ; and quickly he thrust the <lb/>
            table from him, striking it with his foot, and he poured the <lb/>
            viands to the ground: both bread and roasted flesh were pol­ <lb/>
            luted. But the suitors made a tumult in the house, when they <lb/>
            beheld the man fallen. And they leaped out of their thrones, <lb/>
            aroused throughout the house, looking about on all sides to the <lb/>
            well-built walls: nor was there any where a shield, or doughty <lb/>
            spear, to lay hold of. And they chided Ulysses with wrathful <lb/>
            words: <note type="footnote"> 1 It is most easy to translate <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυμνώθη</foreign> as if it were the middle voice. </note><note type="footnote"> * See Fishlake on Buttm.

            more wilt thou meet with other contests ; now bitter destruc­ <lb/>
            tion is safe for thee. For thou hast just now slain a man, <lb/>
            who is far the best of the youths in Ithaca; therefore shall the <lb/>
            vultures eat thee here."</p>
          <p>Each man reflected,4 since they said that he did not will­ <lb/>
            ingly slay the man ; but this, fools ! they did not perceive, how <lb/>
            the limits of destruction were closely touching them, even <lb/>
            all [of them]. But much-planning Ulysses regarding them <lb/>
            sternly, addressed them:</p>
          <p>" O dogs, you no longer thought that I should come return­ <lb/>
            ing home from the people of the Trojans, wherefore ye con- <lb/>
            Slime my property, and lie perforce with my women-servants, <lb/>
            and woo my wife, I myself being alive, neither dreading the <lb/>
            gods, who possess the wide heaven, nor [fearing] that there <lb/>
            will be any vengeance from men hereafter. Now the limits of <lb/>
            destruction have closely touched you, even all [of you]."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and pale fear seized all of them ; [and each <lb/>
            looked about, where he might escape bitter destruction.] But <lb/>
            Eurymachus alone answering addressed him:</p>
          <p>" If indeed thou, the Ithacan Ulysses, hast come, thou hast <lb/>
            spoken these things rightly, how many things the Greeks have <lb/>
            done, many wicked deeds in the palace, and many in the <lb/>
            country. But he now lies down, who was the cause of all, <lb/>
            Antinous : for he brought together these deeds ; by no means <lb/>
            so much desiring or craving marriage, but thinking of other <lb/>
            things, which the son of Saturn has not accomplished: that <lb/>
            he might himself reign over the people of well-inhabited <lb/>
            Ithaca, and having in snared thy son he would have slain him. <lb/>
            But lie is now slain in fate; and do thou spare thy people: <lb/>
            but we afterwards appeasing thee throughout the people, [as <lb/>
            to] whatever .has been drunk and eaten in the palace, each <lb/>
            bringing as payment twenty beeves, will give both brass and <lb/>
            gold, until thy heart is glad: but before there was no cause <lb/>
            of reproach for thy being angry."</p>
          <p>But him much-counselling Ulysses sternly regarding, ad­ <lb/>
            dressed : " O Eurymachus, even if thou wouldst give me all <lb/>
            your paternal property, whatever thou now hast, and should <lb/>
            add other things from any where, not even thus would I stop <note type="footnote"> 4 See Buttm. Lexil. p. 276, sqq. The interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίσκε</foreign> is very <lb/>

            mine hands from slaughter, before I had revenged all their <lb/>
            overbearing conduct upon the suitors. Ye now have the <lb/>
            choice, either to fight against me, or to fly, whoever can escape <lb/>
            death and the Fates. But I do not think any one will escape <lb/>
            bitter destruction."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and there their knees and heart were <lb/>
            loosed. But Eurymachus again a second time addressed <lb/>
            them:</p>
          <p>"0 friends, for5 this man will not restrain his invincible <lb/>
            hands; but since he has taken the well-polished bow, and <lb/>
            the quiver, he will shoot arrows from the polished threshold, <lb/>
            until he has slain all of us: but let us be mindful of battle: <lb/>
            and do ye draw your swords, and hold up the tables against <lb/>
            the quick-fated arrows; and let us all hold together against <lb/>
            him, if we can thrust him out from the threshold and the door. <lb/>
            But let us go through the city, and let an alarm be raised as <lb/>
            quickly as possible. Then will this man soon shoot an arrow <lb/>
            for the last time."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he drew his sharp sword of brass, <lb/>
            sharpened on both sides ; and he leaped against him, shouting <lb/>
            dreadfully: but at the same time divine Ulysses sending forth a <lb/>
            shaft, struck him upon the breast, near the nipple, and he fixed <lb/>
            the swift weapon in his liver; and he threw his sword upon <lb/>
            the ground from his hand, and rushing round the table6 he <lb/>
            fell staggering; and he poured the viands on the ground, and <lb/>
            the round cup: and he smote the ground with his forehead, <lb/>
            sorrowing in mind; and he shook his throne, kicking it with <lb/>
            both his feet: and darkness was shed over his eyes. And <lb/>
            Amphinomus came against glorious Ulysses rushing upon <lb/>
            him: and he drew his sharp sword, in case he might give <lb/>
            way from the door: but Telemachus anticipated him, striking <lb/>
            him from behind with a brass-pointed spear between the <lb/>
            shoulders, and he drove it through his breast: and he re­ <lb/>
            sounded as he fell, and struck the ground with his whole fore­ <lb/>
            head. But Telemachus rushed away, leaving the long spear <lb/>
            there in Amphinomus; for he very much feared, that some <note type="footnote"> 5 It is somewhat difficult to express the force of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰϱ</foreign> in this passage. <lb/>

            one of the Grecians, as he was drawing out the long spear, <lb/>
            would either rush upon him and pierce him with a sword, or <lb/>
            strike him with a downward [blow].7 But he went running ; <lb/>
            and quickly came to his dear father: and standing near him <lb/>
            he addressed to him winged words :</p>
          <p>" O my father, now will I bring thee a shield and two <lb/>
            spears, and a brazen helmet, fitted to thy temples, and I my­ <lb/>
            self will go and clothe myself; and I will give others to the <lb/>
            swineherd and to the herdsman ; for it is better to be armed."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses answering addressed : <lb/>
            " Run, bring them, while I have arrows to defend myself, lest <lb/>
            they move me, being alone, away from the door."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and Telemachus obeyed his dear father. <lb/>
            And he went to the chamber, where his illustrious arms lay. <lb/>
            From thence he took out four shields, and eight spears, and <lb/>
            four brazen helmets dense with horse-hair plumes; and he <lb/>
            went, carrying them, and very quickly he came to his dear <lb/>
            father. But he first of all put on brass around his body; and <lb/>
            in like manner the two servants put on beautiful arms, and stood <lb/>
            around wise, various-planning Ulysses. But he, as long as <lb/>
            he had arrows to ward them off, so long did he still strike one <lb/>
            of the suitors in his own house, aiming at him, and they fell <lb/>
            near to each other. But when the arrows failed the king <lb/>
            shooting, he reclined his bow to stand against a pillar of the <lb/>
            well-built palace, against the all-shining walls: and he girt a <lb/>
            four-fold shield around his shoulders, and on his illustrious <lb/>
            head he placed a well-made helmet with a horse-hair plume, <lb/>
            and a terrible crest nodded from above; and he took two <lb/>
            strong spears tipt with brass.</p>
          <p>Now there was a certain high-raised doors in the well-built <note type="footnote"> 7 Supply a cognate substantive from <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύψας</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Few passages in the Odyssey present greater difficulties than the <lb/>
            present one. The ancient critics were quite uncertain, as will be evi <lb/>
            dent from the following remarks. Eustathius observes, " '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ορσοθύρη</foreign> here <lb/>
            signifies some conspicuous entrance, having a high approach, which <lb/>
            no one could reach without using a ladder, or jumping and leaping up <lb/>
            to it, whence it was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">όρσοθύρη</foreign>, i. e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύρα είς ήν όρνυταί τις</foreign>, wish­ <lb/>
            ing to see out from thence." The same etymology is given in Etym. <lb/>
            Magn. s. v. fol. 136, A. 2, Hesych. t. ii. p. 789, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι' ής έστιν όροῡσαι κα­ <lb/>
            ταβαίνοντα</foreign>, and Apoll. Lex. Horn. s. v. Pollux, i. 8, 2, makes the <foreign xml:lang="grc">όρσο­ <lb/>

            wall: and near the farthest threshold of the well-reared palace <lb/>
            was a way to a narrow street, but well-fitted doors enclosed <lb/>
            it: this Ulysses desired the swineherd to guard, standing near <lb/>
            it; for it was the only approach. But Agelaus addressed <lb/>
            them, speaking the word to all:</p>
          <p>" O friends, will not some one go up to the high-raised <lb/>
            door, and tell the people? and there would very quickly be an <lb/>
            alarm: then perchance this man will shoot an arrow for the <lb/>
            last time."</p>
          <p>But him Melanthius, the goatherd, addressed in turn: "It <lb/>
            is not possible, O Jove-nurtured Agelaus; for very near are <lb/>
            the beautiful doors of the hall, and difficult is the mouth of the <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν τὴν αύθεντικὴν, έτέραν δὲ, ήν "Ομηρος λέγει όρσοθύρην</foreign>. As none of <lb/>
            the commentators appear satisfied on the point, I will propose my own <lb/>
            explanation. The particle <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ</foreign> in vs. 127, is used adversatively, and shows <lb/>
            that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">όδὸς είς λαύρην</foreign>, was distinct from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">όρσοθύρη</foreign>. Eumæus (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δίος <lb/>
            ύφορβὸς</foreign> in vs. 129) is ordered to guard the former way, while the <lb/>
            suitors, especially Agelaus, sought to reach the <foreign xml:lang="grc">όρσοθύρη</foreign>, which led to <lb/>
            the armoury-chamber, to which Melanthius afterwards ascended, (vs. <lb/>
            142,) and there met his death (174, sqq.). The expression pwyag <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγά­ <lb/>
            ροιο</foreign>, in vs. 143, appears to be identical with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">όρσοθύρη</foreign>, especially if we <lb/>
            compare <foreign xml:lang="grc">άνέβαινε</foreign> in vs. 142, with av' <foreign xml:lang="grc">όρσοθύρην άναβαίη</foreign> in vs. 132. <lb/>
            Now, although the alarm might be given from the chamber, to which the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">όρσοθύρη</foreign> led, (vss. 133, sq.,) yet there was but one entrance, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μία έφορμὴ</foreign>, <lb/>
            vs. 130,) by which the people could have rushed to the assistance of the <lb/>
            suitors, and defeated the purpose of Ulysses (vs. 134). But Melanthius <lb/>
            objects that it was no use to give the alarm, because the door of the hall <lb/>
            was close by, and the entrance to the Xavpa was difficult (i. e. narrow, <lb/>
            hard of access). It appears to me that the chief difficulty arises from <lb/>
            misunderstanding the sense of Xavpa, which the grammarians (see Alberti <lb/>
            on IIesych. t. ii. p. 434, and Pollux, ix. 5) unite in interpreting "a nar­ <lb/>
            row street," <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι' ής ό λαὸς είσέχεται</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">στενωπός</foreign>. Hesychius is perhaps <lb/>
            nearest the truth, when he also says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόπος πρὸς ύποχώρησιν άνείμενος</foreign>, <lb/>
            the exedra of the Latins, (cf. Vitruv. v. 11,) or the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραστάδες</foreign> of Pollux, <lb/>
            vii. 27. But I believe that <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαύρην</foreign> here =<foreign xml:lang="grc">κοπρω̄να</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίπνον</foreign>, (cf. Pollux, <lb/>
            v. 14,) "a jakes" or "draught." So it is used by Aristoph. Pac. 157, <lb/>
            roi <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρακλίνεις Τοὺς μυκτη̄ρας πρὸς τὰς λαύρας</foreign>. Nor am I quite <lb/>
            without ancient authority for this supposition; for Hipponax, according <lb/>
            to the Etym. Magn. s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">όδὸς</foreign>, fol. 132, A. 2, understood it in the same <lb/>
            sense. If we compare the house of Sallust discovered at Pompeii, (see <lb/>
            Library of Entertaining Knowledge, Pompeii, vol. ii. pp. 109, 121,) we <lb/>
            shall find that the Xavpa was situated very near the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αύλὴ</foreign>, as well as that <lb/>
            it was closely connected with the private apartments; we may therefore <lb/>
            fairly understand the mention of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αύλὴ</foreign> in vs. 137, as well as the diffi­ <lb/>
            culty of entrance, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άργαλέον στόμα λαύρης</foreign>,) of which Melanthius speaks. <lb/>
            I have however translated the passage according to the old interpretation, <lb/>
            leaving this new explanation to the consideration of other scholars. </note> <pb n="301"/>

            narrow road; and even one man, who is valiant, would <lb/>
            binder us all. But come, I will bring you arms from the <lb/>
            chamber wherewith to be equipped: for within, I think, nor <lb/>
            anywhere else have Ulysses and his illustrious son laid up the <lb/>
            arms."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, Melanthius the goatherd ascended to <lb/>
            the chambers of Ulysses, through the narrow parts of the <lb/>
            palace: from thence he took out twelve shields, and so many <lb/>
            spears, and so many brazen helmets, dense with horse-hair: <lb/>
            and he went, and quickly carrying them, gave them to the <lb/>
            suitors. Then the knees and heart of Ulysses were loosed, <lb/>
            when he beheld them putting on the arms, and shaking the <lb/>
            long spears in their hands ; but it appeared to him a dreadful <lb/>
            deed. And quickly he addressed to Telemachus winged <lb/>
            words:</p>
          <p>" O Telemachus, certainly some one of the women in the <lb/>
            palace, or Melanthius, excites an evil war against us."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn : " O father, <lb/>
            I myself erred in this, (nor is any one else the cause,) who <lb/>
            having opened the closely-fitted door of the chamber left it: <lb/>
            but their spy was better. But come, divine Eumæus, shut <lb/>
            the door of the chamber, and see if it is any one of the women <lb/>
            who does these things, or Melanthius, son of Dolius, whom I <lb/>
            think [it is]."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke to one another. But Melanthius the <lb/>
            goatherd went again to the chamber, to bring the beautiful <lb/>
            arms: but the divine swineherd perceived him, and imme­ <lb/>
            diately addressed Ulysses being near:</p>
          <p>" O noble son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses, again <lb/>
            is that wicked9 man, whom we ourselves suspected, going to <lb/>
            the chamber : but do thou tell me plainly, whether I shall kill <lb/>
            him, if indeed I should be superior [to him] ; or bring him <lb/>
            here for thee, that thou mayest be revenged for the many over­ <lb/>
            bearing deeds which he has devised in thine house."</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            "I myself and Telemachus will keep off the noble suitors <lb/>
            within the palace, elthough very eager: but do ye two turn­ <lb/>
            ing back his feet and hands above, throw him into the cham­ <lb/>
            ber, and fasten the doors behind you; and binding a twisted <lb/>
            rope from him, draw him up a lofty pillar, and make him <note type="footnote"> ' On <foreign xml:lang="grc">άίδηλος</foreign> see Buttm. Lexil. p. 47, sqq. </note> <pb n="302"/>

            draw nigh to the rafters, that for a long time, being alive, he <lb/>
            may suffer severe griefs."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but they indeed heard him, and obeyed. <lb/>
            and they went to the chamber; and they escaped the notice <lb/>
            of him who was within. He indeed was searching for arms <lb/>
            in the recess of the chamber: but they stood on each side re­ <lb/>
            maining near to the pillars. When Melanthius, the goatherd, <lb/>
            came over the threshold, in one hand indeed bearing a beauti­ <lb/>
            ful helmet, but in the other a wide shield, old, spoiled with <lb/>
            dryness, belonging to the hero Laertes, which he had carried <lb/>
            when a youth: at that time it lay aside, and the sewings of <lb/>
            the thongs were loosed. But they rushing upon him seized <lb/>
            him, and dragged him within by the hair : and they cast him <lb/>
            down on the pavement sorrowing in his heart. And they <lb/>
            bound his hands and feet together with a mind-grieving bond, <lb/>
            having turned them very well entirely back, as the much- <lb/>
            enduring son of Laertes, divine Ulysses, had commanded <lb/>
            them. And binding a twisted rope from him, they drew him <lb/>
            up a lofty pillar, and made him draw near to the rafters. But <lb/>
            him thou didst with gibing address, O swineherd Eumæus:</p>
          <p>"Now, O Melanthius, shalt thou watch during the whole <lb/>
            night, lying down upon a soft bed, as becomes thee: nor will <lb/>
            the mother of dawn coming upon thee in her golden throne, <lb/>
            from the streams of the ocean, escape thee, when thou drivest <lb/>
            goats for the suitors to the house, to get ready a feast."</p>
          <p>Thus was he left there, stretched in a woeful bond. But <lb/>
            they, having put on arms, and shut the shining door, went to <lb/>
            wise, crafty Ulysses. There they stood breathing forth might; <lb/>
            those who were upon the threshold, four in number; but <lb/>
            those within the house, many and brave. But Minerva, <lb/>
            daughter of Jove, came near them, likened unto Mentor both <lb/>
            in person and voice. And Ulysses rejoiced on seeing her, and <lb/>
            spoke thus:</p>
          <p>"Mentor, ward off the light, and remember me a dear corn <lb/>
            panion, who have done thee good, and thou art of the same <lb/>
            age with me."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, thinking that it was Minerva, the defender <lb/>
            of the people. But the suitors from the other side were <lb/>
            threatening in the palace; first indeed Agelaus, son of Da­ <lb/>
            mastor, chided her:</p>
          <p>" Mentor, let not Ulysses wrongly persuade thee with <pb n="303"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="214—251."/> <lb/>
            words to fight against the suitors, and to defend him himself. <lb/>
            For thus I deem that our counsel will be accomplished ; when <lb/>
            we have slain them, both father and son, then thou wilt be <lb/>
            slain amongst them, such things dost thou meditate to do in <lb/>
            the palace; and thou wilt atone for them with thy own head. <lb/>
            But when we shall have taken away thy strength with the brass, <lb/>
            thy possessions, whatever thou hast, both those within, and <lb/>
            those out of doors, we will mix with the possessions of Ulysses : <lb/>
            nor will we suffer thy sons or daughters to dwell in thy <lb/>
            palaces, nor thy prudent wife to abide in the city of Ithaca."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but Minerva was more enraged at heart, <lb/>
            and she chided Ulysses with wrathful words :</p>
          <p>No longer is thy strength firm, O Ulysses, nor hast thou <lb/>
            any courage, such as when thou foughtest after nine years <lb/>
            with the Trojans, ever, without ceasing, for white-armed, <lb/>
            noble-born Helen : and many men didst thou slay in terrible <lb/>
            strife, and by thy counsel was the wide-wayed city of Troy <lb/>
            taken. How now then, when thou art come to thine own <lb/>
            house and possessions, dost thou fail in being valiant 10 against <lb/>
            the suitors ? But come hither, my soft friend, stand near me, <lb/>
            and behold a deed, that thou mayest see, what a one Mentor <lb/>
            Alcimedes is amongst hostile men, to requite benefits."</p>
          <p>She spoke ; and did not yet altogether give them a decided 11 <lb/>
            victory, but still tried the strength and courage both of Ulysses <lb/>
            and of his glory-seeking son. But rushing up to the roof of <lb/>
            the shining palace, she sat down, like unto a swallow to behold. <lb/>
            But Agelaus, son of Damastor, incited the suitors, as also [did] <lb/>
            Eurynomus, and Amphimedon, and Demoptolemus, and Pi­ <lb/>
            sander, son of Polyctor, and warlike Polybus ; for in valour <lb/>
            they were far the best of the suitors, as many as were still <lb/>
            alive, and they fought for their lives: but the others the bow <lb/>
            and the fleet arrows had already subdued. And Agelaus spoke <lb/>
            to them, addressing discourse to all:</p>
          <p>" O friends, now will this man restrain his invincible hands ; <lb/>
            even Mentor has gone, having spoken vain prayers for him, <lb/>
            and they are left alone at the first gates. Now therefore do <note type="footnote"> 10 <foreign xml:lang="grc">όλοφύρεαι</foreign>.

            not all at the same time send forth your long spears; but <lb/>
            come, six of you hurl first, if Jove will grant that Ulysses <lb/>
            may be wounded, and that we obtain renown: but for the <lb/>
            others there is no care, when he at least shall have fallen."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and they all eager hurled their javelins, as <lb/>
            he commanded ; but Minerva made them all vain. One of <lb/>
            them struck the pillar of the well-reared palace, another the <lb/>
            closely-fitted door ; and the ashen shaft of another, heavy with <lb/>
            brass, fell in the wall. But when they had avoided the spears <lb/>
            of the suitors, to them much-enduring divine Ulysses began <lb/>
            discourse:</p>
          <p>" O friends, now would I say that we should hurl our jave­ <lb/>
            lins into the crowd of the suitors, who desire to slay us in <lb/>
            addition to the former evils."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and they all hurled their sharp spears, <lb/>
            aiming opposite: Ulysses slew Demoptolemus, and Telema­ <lb/>
            chus Euryades, and the swineherd Elatus, and the herdsmen <lb/>
            of oxen slew Pisander: then all of them bit the immense <lb/>
            floor with their teeth. But the suitors retreated to the recess <lb/>
            of the palace: but they rushed upon them, and took out the <lb/>
            spears from the dead. And the suitors again eager hurled <lb/>
            their sharp spears; but Minerva made many of them vain. <lb/>
            One of them struck the pillar of the well-reared palace, an­ <lb/>
            other the closely-fitted door; and the ash of another, heavy <lb/>
            with brass, fell in the wall. But Amphimedon struck Tele­ <lb/>
            machus on the hand at the wrist, so as to graze, and the brass <lb/>
            hurt the surface of the skin. But Ctesippus grazed Eumaeus <lb/>
            upon the shoulder over his shield, with his long spear, but it <lb/>
            flew over and fell to the ground. But they again with wise, <lb/>
            crafty Ulysses, hurled their sharp spears into the crowd of <lb/>
            suitors; then city-destroying Ulysses struck Eurydamus, and <lb/>
            Telemachus Amphimedon, and the swineherd Polybus; then <lb/>
            the herdsman of oxen struck Ctesippus on the breast; and <lb/>
            boasting over him, addressed him :</p>
          <p>" O son of Polytherses, lover of gibing, do not, yielding <lb/>
            to thy folly, altogether speak bigly, but leave words to the <lb/>
            gods; since they are much superior. This is a hospitable <lb/>
            gift for thee in turn for the foot which thou once gavest god­ <lb/>
            like Ulysses, while begging through the house."</p>
          <p>The herdsman of curved-horned oxen spoke but Ulysses <lb/>
            wounded the son of Damastor hand to hand with a long spear: <pb n="305"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="294—329."/> <lb/>
            and Telemachus wounded Leiocritus, son of Evenor, with a <lb/>
            spear, in the middle of the belly, and he drove the brass entirely <lb/>
            through; and he fell on his face, and smote the earth with <lb/>
            his whole forehead. Then Minerva held up her man-destroy­ <lb/>
            ing Ægis on high from the roof ; and their minds were flut­ <lb/>
            tered. And they fled through the palace, like herding cattle, <lb/>
            upon which a swift gad-fly has rushed, and thrown into con­ <lb/>
            fusion, in the spring time, when the days are long.12 They, <lb/>
            like as crooked-clawed, bow-beaked 13 vultures, coming from <lb/>
            the mountains, pounce upon the birds which go along, crouch­ <lb/>
            ing at the nets in the plain, but they, leaping upon them, de­ <lb/>
            stroy them, nor is there any defence, or escape; and men <lb/>
            rejoice in the prey: so they, rushing upon the suitors in the <lb/>
            house, struck them upon all sides ; and there arose an unseemly <lb/>
            mourning from them, while their heads were stricken ; and <lb/>
            the whole pavement bubbled with gore. And Leiodes rush­ <lb/>
            ing seized the knees of Ulysses, and supplicating him, spoke <lb/>
            winged words:</p>
          <p>" I implore thee, O Ulysses; and do thou reverence me, <lb/>
            and pity me; for I do not think that to any of the women in <lb/>
            the palace I have spoken or done any thing wicked: but I <lb/>
            even restrained the other suitors, whoever did such things. <lb/>
            But they did not obey me, so as to keep off their hands from <lb/>
            evil deeds. Therefore through their wickedness they have <lb/>
            drawn on an unseemly fate. But I, a soothsayer amongst <lb/>
            them, having done nothing, will fall. Thus are there no thanks <lb/>
            hereafter for good deeds."</p>
          <p>But him much-counselling Ulysses sternly regarding, ad­ <lb/>
            dressed : " If indeed thou dost profess to be a soothsayer <lb/>
            amongst them, oftentimes then thou must have prayed in the <lb/>
            palace, that the end of a sweet return might be far from me, <lb/>
            and that my dear wife might follow thee, and bring forth <lb/>
            children [to thee] : therefore shalt thou not escape sad-slum­ <lb/>
            bering death."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he took in his strong hand a sword, <lb/>
            lying down, which Agelaus, when slain, threw from him upon <lb/>
            the ground; with this he smote him in the middle of the <lb/>
            neck. And the head of him crying out was mixed in the dust. <note type="footnote"> 12 Cf. Virgo Georg. iii. 146, sqq. Apollon. Rho)d. i. 1265, sqq. with the, <lb/>

            But Phemius, son of Terpius, the bard, avoided black Fate, <lb/>
            who indeed had sung amongst the suitors through compulsion ; <lb/>
            and he stood holding the clear-toned harp in his hands, near <lb/>
            the high gate: and he meditated two ways in his mind, <lb/>
            whether, going out of the palace, he should sit at the well- <lb/>
            built altar of mighty Hercæan Jove, where Laertes and <lb/>
            Ulysses burnt many thighs of oxen ; or rushing to Ulysses, <lb/>
            should supplicate him at his knees. And thus to him con­ <lb/>
            sidering it seemed to be better to take hold of the knees of <lb/>
            Ulysses, son of Laertes. lie indeed placed the hollow harp <lb/>
            upon the ground, between the cup and the silver-studded <lb/>
            throne: but he himself then rushing to Ulysses, laid hold of <lb/>
            his knees, and supplicating him, spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" I entreat thee, O Ulysses; and do thou revere me and <lb/>
            pity me: there will be sorrow to thee thyself hereafter, if thou <lb/>
            slayest me, a bard, who sing to gods and men. But I am <lb/>
            self-taught; and God has breathed into my mind all kinds of <lb/>
            songs ; and I am able to sing to thee as to a god ; therefore do <lb/>
            not be desirous to cut off my head. Even Telemachus, thy <lb/>
            beloved son, would say thus, how neither willingly, nor desir­ <lb/>
            ing [to do so], I have resorted to thy house, to sing at feasts <lb/>
            to the suitors, but many more and superior men brought me <lb/>
            by compulsion."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and the sacred might of Telemachus heard <lb/>
            him, and he immediately addressed his father, who was near:</p>
          <p>" Restrain thyself, nor by any means wound this blameless <lb/>
            man with the brass. And we will save the herald Medon, <lb/>
            who always took care of me in our house, while I was a child ; <lb/>
            if indeed Philætius, or the swineherd, have not already slain <lb/>
            him, he has met with thee when aroused in the house."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but Medon, who kenned prudent things, <lb/>
            heard him ; for he lay crouching under a throne, and a newly­ <lb/>
            flayed skin of an ox was put around him, avoiding black Fate. <lb/>
            And he immediately arose from the throne, and quickly put off <lb/>
            the ox hide: then rushing to Telemachus, he laid hold of his <lb/>
            knees, and supplicating him, spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" O friend, I indeed am here; but do thou restrain thyself; <lb/>
            and speak to thy father, lest, being excessively powerful, he <lb/>
            destroy me with the sharp brass, enraged against the suitors, <lb/>
            who have wasted his wealth in the palace, but, fools ! did not <lb/>
            honour thee."</p><pb n="307"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="371-413."/>
          <p>But much-planning Ulysses, smiling on him, addressed <lb/>
            him : " Be confident, since he has freed thee and saved thee, <lb/>
            that thou mayest know in thy mind, and mayest also tell to <lb/>
            another, how far better doing good is than doing evil. But <lb/>
            going out of the palace into the hall, sit out of doors, away <lb/>
            from the slaughter, thou and the much-voiced bard, whilst I <lb/>
            labour in the house, what I have need."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and they two went out, going from the <lb/>
            palace. Then they sat at the altar of mighty Jove, looking <lb/>
            about on all sides, continually expecting death. But Ulysses <lb/>
            looked about in his house, whether any one of men still alive <lb/>
            was concealed, avoiding black Fate. And he saw them all <lb/>
            fallen in blood and dust, in great numbers, as fish, which the <lb/>
            fishermen have drawn upon the hollow beach out from the <lb/>
            hoary sea with a net of many holes : and they all regretting <lb/>
            the waves of the sea have been poured out upon the sands, but <lb/>
            their life the shining Sun has taken away: thus then the <lb/>
            suitors were poured over one another. Then at length <lb/>
            much-planning Ulysses addressed Telemachus:</p>
          <p>" Telemachus, come, call to me the nurse Euryclea, that I <lb/>
            may tell her something which is in my mind."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and Telemachus obeyed his dear father ; <lb/>
            and moving the door, he addressed the nurse Euryclea: <lb/>
            " Now arise [to come] hither, O ancient old woman, thou who <lb/>
            art the overseer of our women-servants in the palace: come; <lb/>
            my father calls thee, that he may tell thee something."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and to her the word was unwinged ; and <lb/>
            she opened the gates of the well-inhabited palace, and hastened <lb/>
            to go: but Telemachus first led the way. She then found <lb/>
            Ulysses amongst the slain and dead, besmeared with blood and <lb/>
            gore ; like as a lion who comes, having devoured a field- <lb/>
            dwelling ox, and all his breast, and his cheeks on both sides <lb/>
            are bloody ; and he is terrible in his visage to behold : thus <lb/>
            was Ulysses besmeared as to his feet and hands above. But <lb/>
            she, when site beheld the corses, and the immense quantity of <lb/>
            blood, proceeded to shout out, since she beheld a terrible <lb/>
            deed; but Ulysses restrained and hindered her, although <lb/>
            eager, and addressing her, he spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" Rejoice, O aged woman, in thy mind, and restrain thyself. <lb/>
            nor shout out; it is not holy to boast over slain men. But the <lb/>
            fate of the gods has subdued these, and their foolish deeds; <note type="footnote"> v 2 </note> <pb n="308"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="414—451"/> <lb/>
            for they respected no one of mortal men, either wicked or good, <lb/>
            whoever came to them; therefore through their infatuation <lb/>
            they have drawn on an unseemly fate. But come, do thou <lb/>
            enumerate tome the women in the palace, both who dishonour <lb/>
            me, and who are innocent."</p>
          <p>But him the dear nurse Euryclea addressed in turn: <lb/>
            " Therefore, my child, will I tell thee the truth. Thou hast <lb/>
            fifty women-servants in the palace, which we have taught to <lb/>
            work works,14 to card fleeces, and to endure servitude: of <lb/>
            these twelve have trod the path of shamelessness, neither re­ <lb/>
            specting me nor Penelope herself. But Telemachus has but <lb/>
            lately grown up, nor did his mother suffer him to give direc­ <lb/>
            tions to the women-servants. But come, ascending to the <lb/>
            beautiful upper-room, I will tell thy wife, upon whom some <lb/>
            god has brought on sleep."</p>
          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses answering addressed : <lb/>
            " Do not yet rouse her up; but do thou bid the women come <lb/>
            hither, who have before devised disgraceful deeds."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and the old woman went through the palace <lb/>
            to tell the women, and to incite them to return. But he, call­ <lb/>
            ing Telemachus and the herdsman and swineherd to him, <lb/>
            spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" Now begin to carry away the dead, and bid the women <lb/>
            [do so] ; and then clean the very beautiful thrones and tables <lb/>
            with water and much-perforated sponges. But when ye have <lb/>
            arranged all things in the house, taking the handmaidens out <lb/>
            of the well-reared palace, strike them with long-pointed <lb/>
            swords between the dome and the spotless court of the hall, <lb/>
            until ye have taken away the lives of all of them, and they <lb/>
            have forgotten Venus, whom they enjoyed with the suitors, <lb/>
            and were mingled secretly [in love]."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and the women came all together, lament­ <lb/>
            ing sadly, shedding the warm tear. First indeed then they <lb/>
            carried away the dead corses, and they placed them under the <lb/>
            portico of the well-enclosed court, resting against each other: 15 <lb/>
            and Ulysses himself gave directions, hastening them: and <lb/>
            they carried them out even by compulsion. But when they had <lb/>
            cleansed the very beautiful thrones and tables, with water, and <lb/>
            much perforated sponges. But Telemachus and the herda­ <note type="footnote"> " Observe the ancient pleonastic form of expression. </note><note type="footnote"> 15 In order to support the weight </note> <pb n="309"/>

            man and swineherd polished the pavement of the stout-built <lb/>
            house with scrapers; and the handmaidens carried away [the <lb/>
            dirt], and put it out of doors. But when they had put in <lb/>
            order the whole palace throughout, leading out the hand­ <lb/>
            maidens from the well-made palace, between the dome, and <lb/>
            the spotless court of the hall, they shut them up in a narrow <lb/>
            place, from whence it was not possible to escape. And <lb/>
            prudent Telemachus began to address them :</p>
          <p>"I would not indeed take away the life of these [women] <lb/>
            with a pure death,16 these, who have poured reproaches upon <lb/>
            my head, and upon my mother, and have slept with the <lb/>
            suitors."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and fastening the cable of an azure-prowed <lb/>
            ship to a tall column, he threw it round the dome, stretching <lb/>
            it out on high, that no one might reach the ground with her <lb/>
            feet. But as when either broad-winged thrushes or doves strike <lb/>
            against a net, which stood in a thicket, as they are entering <lb/>
            their nest, and a hateful bed has received them : so they held <lb/>
            their heads in order, and around all their necks were cords, that <lb/>
            they might die as miserably as possible. And they struggled <lb/>
            convulsively with their feet for a little while, not very long. <lb/>
            And they brought Melanthius out through the vestibule and <lb/>
            the ball ; his nostrils and ears they cut off with the cruel <lb/>
            brass; and his secret parts they drew out, for the dogs to eat <lb/>
            saw, and they lopped off his hands and feet, with wrathful <lb/>
            mind. They then having washed their hands and feet, went <lb/>
            to the house, to Ulysses: and the work was completed. But <lb/>
            he addressed the dear nurse Euryclea:</p>
          <p>" Bring sulphur, O old woman, as a remedy for ills, 17 and <lb/>
            bring me fire, that I may fumigate the palace: and do thou <lb/>
            desire Penelope to come hither, with her women attendants : <lb/>
            and order all the handmaidens in the house to come."</p>
          <p>But him the dear nurse Euryclea addressed in turn: " Of <lb/>
            a truth, indeed, my child, hast thou spoken these things <lb/>
            rightly. But come, I will bring thee garments, both a cloak <note type="footnote"> 16 Eustathius observes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθαρὸς μὲν όδιὰ ξίφουςέδόκει θάνατος, μιαροι <lb/>

          <p>But her much-planning Ulysses answering addressed : <lb/>

          <p>Thus he spoke; nor did the dear nurse Euryclea disobey <lb/>
            him, and she brought fire and sulphur: and Ulysses well <lb/>
            fumigated the palace, and the house, and the hall. The old <lb/>
            woman then went up through the beautiful house of Ulysses, <lb/>
            to tell the women, and to urge them to come: and they came <lb/>
            from the palace, holding a torch in their hands. They in­ <lb/>

            bracing him, they kissed his head and shoulders, laying hold <lb/>
            of his hands: but a sweet desire of wailing and mourning <lb/>

          <p>Penelope, after some hesitation, recognises Ulysses, and he gives satisfactory <lb/>
            proofs of his return. He gives a brief narrative of his adventures. In the <lb/>
            morning Ulysses, Telemachus, Eumæus, and Philætius, leave the city in <lb/>
            order to go to Laertes.</p>
          <p>AND the old woman went up to the upper-room exulting, to <lb/>
            tell her mistress that her dear husband was within ; and her <lb/>
            knees were strengthened, and her feet hastened on ;1 and she <lb/>
            stood over her head, and addressed her:</p>
          <p>" Arise, Penelope, dear child, that thou mayest behold with <lb/>
            thine eyes, things which thou desirest all thy days: Ulysses <lb/>
            has arrived, and has reached home, although having come <lb/>
            late. And he has slain the haughty suitors, who injured his <lb/>
            house, and consumed his wealth, and treated his son with <lb/>
            violence."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Penelope addressed in turn ; " Dear nurse, <lb/>
            the gods have driven thee frantic; who indeed are able to <lb/>
            make one foolish, although one be very wise, and have <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υπερικταίνοντο</foreign>, (from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίκταρ</foreign>,)=<foreign xml:lang="grc">έκινου̃ντο</foreign>. Lex. MS. apud Alberti <lb/>

            changed a vain-minded person to prudence ; they have hurt <lb/>
            even thee; but before thou wast right in thy understanding. <lb/>
            Why dost thou taunt me, who have a much-sorrowing mind, <lb/>
            speaking these out of the way things ? and why hast thou <lb/>
            upraised me from pleasant sleep, which bound me, covering <lb/>
            around my dear eyelids? For never have I slept such asleep, <lb/>
            since Ulysses went to see Ill-Troy, not to be named. But <lb/>
            come, descend now, and go back to the palace. For if any <lb/>
            one else of the women, whom I have, had come telling me <lb/>
            these things, and had raised me up from sleep, then would I <lb/>
            soon have sent her back severely, to return again within the <lb/>
            palace ; but in this thy old age will profit thee."</p>
          <p>But her the dear nurse Euryclea addressed in turn : " I do <lb/>
            not taunt thee, dear child; but Ulysses truly is come, and has <lb/>
            reached home, as I say, the stranger, whom all dishonoured <lb/>
            in the palace; but Telemaehus some time since knew him, <lb/>
            being within, but by his prudence he concealed his know­ <lb/>
            ledge of his father, that he might be revenged on the vio­ <lb/>
            lence of haughty men."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke; but she rejoiced, and leaping from her <lb/>
            bed, embraced the old woman, and from her eyelids sent forth <lb/>
            a tear; and addressing her, she spoke winged wards:</p>
          <p>" Come, dear nurse, tell me truly, if he indeed has reached <lb/>
            home, as thou sayest, how did he lay hands upon the shame­ <lb/>
            less suitors, being alone, whilst they always remained together <lb/>
            within."</p>
          <p>But her the dear nurse Euryclea addressed in turn : "I did <lb/>
            not see, nor did I inquire, but I heard only the groaning of <lb/>
            them being slain ; but we, affrighted, sat in the recess of the <lb/>
            well-built chambers, and the well-fitted doors held fast; before <lb/>
            that thy son Telemachus called me from the palace: for his <lb/>
            father sent him on to call me. Then I found Ulysses stand­ <lb/>
            ing amongst the slain corses; but they around him possessing <lb/>
            the stone-paved ground, lay upon one another: thou wouldst <lb/>
            have rejoiced in thy mind, beholding him [bedaubed with <lb/>
            blood and gore, like a lion]. Now indeed they are all together <lb/>
            at the court gates: but he is fumigating the most beautiful <lb/>
            house, having kindled a great fire: but he sent me on to call <lb/>
            thee. But follow, that both of you may obtain delight in <lb/>
            your dear hearts ; since ye have suffered many evils. But <lb/>
            now at length this long hope is accomplished. He himself <pb n="312"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="55—89."/> <lb/>
            has come alive to the hearth, and he has found thee, and his <lb/>
            son in the palace; but the suitors who treated him evilly, lie <lb/>
            has revenged himself upon all of them in his own house."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Penelope addressed in turn: "0 dear <lb/>
            nurse, do not by any means boast greatly, exulting; for thou <lb/>
            knowest how welcome lie would appear to all in the pa­ <lb/>
            lace, but especially to me, and to my son, to whom we gave <lb/>
            life. But this is not a true tale, as thou tellest it; but some <lb/>
            one of the immortals has slain the noble suitors, being indig­ <lb/>
            nant at their mind-grieving insolence and evil deeds: for they <lb/>
            honoured no one of mortal men, either bad or good, whoever <lb/>
            came to them ; wherefore through their infatuation have they <lb/>
            suffered ill: but Ulysses has lost his return, far away from <lb/>
            Achaia, and has himself perished."</p>
          <p>But her the dear nurse Euryclea then answered : " My <lb/>
            child, what word has escaped thy lips ? didst thou never think <lb/>
            that thy husband, who was within at the hearth, would never <lb/>
            come home? but thy mind is ever incredulous. But come, I <lb/>
            will tell thee some other very plain sign, the scar, which once <lb/>
            a boar inflicted upon him with his white tusk, this I perceived <lb/>
            whilst washing him: and I wished to tell thee thyself; but <lb/>
            he, taking hold of me upon the mouth with his hands, did not <lb/>
            allow me to tell thee, through the great knowledge of his mind. <lb/>
            But follow; and I2 will lay down a pledge for myself,3 if I <lb/>
            deceive thee, that thou shalt kill me by a most grievous de­ <lb/>
            struction."</p>
          <p>But her prudent Penelope then answered : " Dear nurse, it <lb/>
            is difficult for thee to know the counsels of the gods, who are <lb/>
            for ever, although thou art very skilful; but, however, let us <lb/>
            go to my son, that I may see the dead suitors, and him who <lb/>
            slew them."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, she went down from the upper-room; <lb/>
            but much did her heart meditate, whether she should inquire <lb/>
            of her dear husband afar off, or standing near him, should kiss <lb/>
            his head, taking hold of his hands. But when she entered <lb/>
            and passed over the stone threshold, then she sat opposite <note type="footnote"> 2 The full force of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αύτὰρ</foreign> seems to he, " and I, for my part, will," &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Cf.

            Ulysses in the light of the fire, against the other wall: but he <lb/>
            sat against a tall pillar, looking down, expecting, whether his <lb/>
            noble wife would speak to him, when she beheld him with her <lb/>
            eyes. But she sat in silence for a long time, and astonish­ <lb/>
            ment came upon her heart. At one moment indeed she looked <lb/>
            face to face at him with her eyes, but at another moment she <lb/>
            knew him not, having evil garments on his body. But Te­ <lb/>
            lemachus chided her, and spoke, and addressed her:</p>
          <p>" O mother mine, ill-mother, who hast a cruel mind, why <lb/>
            dost thou thus keep away from my father, nor sitting near him, <lb/>
            dost question [him] with words, or inquire ? No other woman <lb/>
            indeed would thus with hardy mind have stood away from her <lb/>
            husband, who, having suffered many ills had reached his pa­ <lb/>
            ternal land in the twentieth year: but thy heart is harder <lb/>
            than stone."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn : " My child, <lb/>
            my mind in my breast is astonished ; neither can I speak any <lb/>
            word to him, nor inquire of him, nor regard his face opposite ; <lb/>
            but if indeed it is Ulysses, and he has reached home, even <lb/>
            better shall we know one another; for there are signs between <lb/>
            us, which we know, secreted from others."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke ; but much-enduring divine Ulysses smiled, <lb/>
            and he immediately addressed to Telemachus winged words:</p>
          <p>" Telemachus, suffer then thy mother in the palace to try <lb/>
            me ; and soon she will know me more certainly. But now, be­ <lb/>
            cause I am squalid, and am clothed with evil garments around <lb/>
            my body, therefore does she disregard me, and does not yet <lb/>
            account that I am he. But let us consider, how it will be <lb/>
            best. For a man having slain one man amongst a people, who <lb/>
            has not many avengers hereafter, flies, leaving his relations <lb/>
            and his paternal land: but we have slain the defence of a city, <lb/>
            those who are far the best of the youths in Ithaca ; therefore <lb/>
            I beg of thee to consider."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus answered in turn: " Dost <lb/>
            thou look to these things, my dear father; for they say that <lb/>
            thy plan is the best amongst men, nor would any other man <lb/>
            among mortal men contend with thee. But we eagerly will <lb/>
            follow with thee, nor do I think that we shall at all want cou­ <lb/>
            rage, whatever power we have."</p>
          <p>But him much-counselling Ulysses answering addressed : <lb/>
            ' Therefore will I say, as it seems to me to be best. First <pb n="314"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="131-170"/> <lb/>
            then wash yourselves, and put on tunics, and order the hand­ <lb/>
            maidens in the palace to take their garments: and let the di­ <lb/>
            vine bard, having the tuneful harp, lead for us the sport-loving <lb/>
            dance, that any one may say it is a marriage, hearing it from <lb/>
            without, either going along the way, or [if he be of those] <lb/>
            who dwell around: lest the wide rumour of the slaughter of <lb/>
            the suitors should arise throughout the city, before we go out <lb/>
            to our much-wooded farm: there then will we consider, what <lb/>
            gain Jove will vouchsafe us."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and they heard him well, and obeyed : first <lb/>
            then they washed themselves, and put on tunics ; and the <lb/>
            women made themselves ready, and the divine bard took the <lb/>
            hollow harp, and stirred up amongst them the desire of the <lb/>
            sweet song, and the harmless dance. And the great house <lb/>
            resounded around with the feet of men and beautiful-girded <lb/>
            women, sporting. And thus some one said, hearing it from <lb/>
            without the dwelling:</p>
          <p>" Of a truth, indeed, some one has married the much- <lb/>
            wooed queen : foolish woman ! nor has she endured to guard <lb/>
            the large house of her virgin husband continually, until that <lb/>
            he should come."</p>
          <p>Thus indeed some one said; but thoy knew not these <lb/>
            things, how they were done. And the housekeeper, Eurynome, <lb/>
            washed magnanimous Ulysses in his own house, and anointed <lb/>
            him with oil ; and she threw a beautiful robe around him, and <lb/>
            a tunic. But Minerva shed much beauty down from his head, <lb/>
            land made him]4 taller and larger to behold: and from his <lb/>
            head she sent down curled hair, like unto an hyacinthine flower. <lb/>
            As when some skilful man pours gold around silver, whom <lb/>
            Vulcan and Pallas Minerva have taught all kinds of art, and <lb/>
            he executes graceful works: so around his head and shoulders <lb/>
            did she pour grace. And he went out of the bath in person <lb/>
            like unto the immortals: and he sat down again on the throne, <lb/>
            from whence he arose, opposite his wife, and addressed her in <lb/>
            words:</p>
          <p>" Honoured lady, they who possess the Olympian houses <lb/>
            have given thee a heart hard above female women: no other <lb/>
            woman indeed would thus, with enduring mind, have stood <lb/>
            away from her husband, who, having suffered many ills, <lb/>
            had reached his paternal land in the twentieth year. But <note type="footnote"> * Observe the zeugma in <foreign xml:lang="grc">χεῡεν</foreign>. </note> <pb n="315"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="171—210."/> <lb/>
            come, nurse, strew a bed for me, that I may lie down by my­ <lb/>
            self: for surely her mind is of steel in her breast."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn: " Sir, I <lb/>
            neither magnify thee at all, nor disregard thee, nor do I very <lb/>
            much wonder at thee : but I very well know, what a one thou <lb/>
            wast, when thou didst depart from Ithaca in a long-oared <lb/>
            ship. But come, Euryclea, strew a dense bed for him with­ <lb/>
            out the well-reared chamber, which he himself made. There <lb/>
            place for him a thick bed, aud throw clothing on it, fleeces, <lb/>
            and cloaks, and beautiful rugs."</p>
          <p>Thus indeed she spoke, trying her husband; but Ulysses <lb/>
            grieving addressed his wife, who knew prudent things:</p>
          <p>" O lady; very grievous indeed is this word thou hast ut­ <lb/>
            tered. Who has placed my bed elsewhere? difficult would it <lb/>
            be even for one who is very skilful, except the deity himself, <lb/>
            coming, were with ease, if he wished it, to put it in another <lb/>
            place. No living mortal among men alive, even if he were in <lb/>
            the vigour of youth, would easily move it away ; since a great <lb/>
            sign is wrought in the well-worked bed; which I laboured, nor <lb/>
            any one else. There was a thick-leaved shrub of olive within <lb/>
            the court, in full vigour, and flourishing; and it was thick, like <lb/>
            as a pillar: I, putting a chamber round this, built it, until I <lb/>
            finished it with close-set stones, and roofed it well above : and <lb/>
            I placed on it glued doors, closely fitted. And then I cut off <lb/>
            the leaves of the thick-leaved olive ; and lopping off the trunk <lb/>
            from the root, I polished it round with brass, well and skil­ <lb/>
            fully, and straightened it according to a rule, working out a <lb/>
            bed-post; and I bored all with a wimble. And beginning <lb/>
            from this I polished the bed until I finished it, variegating it <lb/>
            with gold and silver and ivory, and I stretched out the thong <lb/>
            of an ox shining with purple. Thus I show thee this sign ; <lb/>
            nor do I at all know, lady, whether the bed is still firm, or <lb/>
            some one of men has now placed it elsewhere, cutting off the <lb/>
            root of the olive."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but her knees and dear heart were loosed, <lb/>
            as she recognised the signs which Ulysses told hei evidently. <lb/>
            Then weeping she ran straight forward, and threw her hands <lb/>
            around the neck of Ulysses, and kissed his head, and ad­ <lb/>
            dressed him:</p>
          <p>" Lour not upon me, O Ulysses, since in other things in­ <lb/>
            deed thou art especially prudent among men; but the gods <pb n="316"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="211—253."/> <lb/>
            have given thee toil, who envied that we, remaining near one <lb/>
            another, should be delighted with youth, and reach the thresh­ <lb/>
            old of old age. But do not now be angry with me for this, <lb/>
            nor indignant, that I did not at first thus embrace thee, when <lb/>
            I beheld thee; for my mind always shudders in my breast, for <lb/>
            fear some one of mortals coming should deceive me with words, <lb/>
            for many devise evil means of gain. Nor would Argive Helen, <lb/>
            born of Jove, have been mingled with a foreigner in love and <lb/>
            in the couch, if she had known that the warlike sons of the <lb/>
            Grecians were about to bring her home again to her dear <lb/>
            country. But her the deity indeed excited to do an unseemly <lb/>
            work : but she did not before lay up in her mind the sad ca­ <lb/>
            lamity, from which grief first came also upon us. But now, <lb/>
            since thou hast told me evident signs of our bed, which no <lb/>
            other mortal has beheld, but only thou and I, and one hand­ <lb/>
            maiden only, Actoris, (whom my father gave to me coming <lb/>
            hither, who kept for us the door of the close chamber,) now <lb/>
            thou persuadest my mind, although it is very difficult [to be <lb/>
            persuaded]."</p>
          <p>Thus site spoke, and in him excited still more the desire of <lb/>
            grief; but he wept, holding his delightful wife, who knew <lb/>
            prudent things. And as when the land has appeared welcome to <lb/>
            [men] swimming, whose well-built ship Neptune has wrecked <lb/>
            in the sea, urged by the wind, and the dark billows, but few <lb/>
            have escaped from the hoary sea, swimming to the shore, and <lb/>
            much brine has incrusted round their body, but they gladly <lb/>
            have stepped upon the land, escaping evil; so her husband was <lb/>
            welcome to her beholding him: but she had not yet altogether <lb/>
            let go her white arms from his neck. And now the rosy- <lb/>
            fingered morning would have appeared while they were weep­ <lb/>
            ing, had not blue-eyed Minerva thought of other things. She <lb/>
            detained the long night towards the end, and still kept the <lb/>
            golden-throned Morn in the ocean, nor did site suffer her to <lb/>
            yoke her swift-footed horses, that bear light to men, Lampus <lb/>
            and Phaethon, steeds that lead the Morn. And then indeed <lb/>
            much-planning Ulysses addressed his wife:</p>
          <p>" O wife, we have not yet arrived at the end of all our toils, <lb/>
            but still there will be an immeasurable labour behind, great <lb/>
            and difficult, all which it behoves me to accomplish. For thus <lb/>
            the soul of Tiresias foretold to me on that day, when I went <lb/>
            down to the house of Pluto, seeking for a return for my <pb n="317"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="253—294."/> <lb/>
            companions and myself. But come, wife, let us go to bed, <lb/>
            that even now going to rest, we may be delighted with sweet <lb/>
            sleep."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn: " A bed indeed <lb/>
            then there shall be for thee, whenever thou desirest it in <lb/>
            thine own mind ; since the gods have made thee reach thy <lb/>
            well-built house, and thy paternal land. But since thou hast <lb/>
            mentioned it, and God has put it in thy mind, come, tell me <lb/>
            the toil; since I think I shall hear it afterwards : but it is not <lb/>
            worse to hear it immediately."</p>
          <p>But her much-counselling Ulysses answering addressed : <lb/>
            " Unhappy one! why indeed dost thou again desire me to <lb/>
            speak, urging me very much ? but I will relate [my adven­ <lb/>
            tures], nor will I conceal them. Thy mind indeed will not <lb/>
            rejoice ; for neither do I myself rejoice ; since he has desired <lb/>
            me to go to very many cities of mortals, having in my hands <lb/>
            a well-fitted oar; until I come to those men, who know not <lb/>
            the sea, and who do not eat food mixed with salt, they indeed <lb/>
            neither know the purple-cheeked ships, nor the well-fitted oars, <lb/>
            which are wings for ships. But he told me this plain sign ; (nor <lb/>
            will I conceal it from thee;) when indeed another traveller <lb/>
            meeting me should say that I have a winnowing-fan 5 upon my <lb/>
            glorious shoulder, then he desired me, having fixed an oar in <lb/>
            the earth, and having offered excellent sacrifices to king Nep­ <lb/>
            tune, a ram, and a bull, and a boar, the mate of swine, to go <lb/>
            away home, and to offer up sacred hecatombs to the immortal <lb/>
            gods, who possess the wide heaven, to all in order: but death <lb/>
            will come upon me away from the sea, gentle, such a one as <lb/>
            will kill me overcome by happy old age: and around me <lb/>
            the people will be prosperous; all these things, he said, would <lb/>
            be performed."</p>
          <p>But him prudent Penelope addressed in turn: " If of a <lb/>
            truth the gods make for thee a better old age, then indeed <lb/>
            there is hope that there will be a refuge from ills."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke to one another; but in the mean time <lb/>
            Eurynome and the nurse prepared a bed of soft cloth­ <lb/>
            in-, by the light of shining torches, busying themselves. <lb/>
            And when they bad strewed the thick bed, the old woman <lb/>
            went back to the house to lie down. But the chambermaid <lb/>
            Eurynome led them going to bed, holding a torch in her <note type="footnote"> 6 See xi. 127. </note> <pb n="318"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="295—332"/> <lb/>
            hands ; and having conducted them into the chamber, she went <lb/>
            away again: they then gladly came to the rites of their <lb/>
            ancient bed.6 But Telemachus and the herdsman and swine­ <lb/>
            herd stopped their feet from dancing, and made the women <lb/>
            stop: and they slept in the shady palace. But when they <lb/>
            twain were satiated with agreeable love, they were delighted <lb/>
            telling to one another with words, she indeed, divine one of <lb/>
            women, what things she had endured in the palace, beholding <lb/>
            the destructive company of suitors ; who on her account slew <lb/>
            many [cattle], oxen and fat sheep, and [by whom] much wine <lb/>
            was drawn from the casks. But Jove-sprung Ulysses, [re­ <lb/>
            lating] what cares he had brought upon men, and what he <lb/>
            himself suffering, had toiled through, told all; she then was <lb/>
            delighted hearing it, nor did sleep fall upon her eyelids, before <lb/>
            he had related all. And lie began, how first he subdued the <lb/>
            Ciconians, but then came to the fruitful land of the men Lo­ <lb/>
            tophagi; and how many deeds the Cyclops did, and how he <lb/>
            avenged the destruction of his doughty companions, whom he <lb/>
            eat,7 nor did he pity them: and how he came to Æolus, who <lb/>
            kindly received film and sent him away; nor yet was it fated <lb/>
            for him to reach his paternal land ; but the tempest snatching <lb/>
            him away again, bore him mourning heavily over the fishy <lb/>
            sea ; and how he came to Læstrigonia to Telephilus, who 8 de­ <lb/>
            stroyed his ships, and his well-greaved companions [all; but <lb/>
            Ulysses alone escaped in a black ship]:9 and he related the <lb/>
            deceit and the various contrivance of Circe; and how he came <lb/>
            into the spacious dwelling of Pluto, in a many-benched ship, <lb/>
            to consult the soul of Theban Tiresias, and saw all his com­ <lb/>
            panions, and his mother, who brought him forth and nourished <lb/>
            him, being little : and how he heard the voice of the assembled <lb/>
            Sirens ; and how he came to the wandering rocks, and to <lb/>
            terrible Charybdis and Scylla, which men have never escaped <lb/>
            unharmed: and how his companions slew the beeves of the <lb/>
            Sun, and how high-thundering Jove struck the swift ship with <lb/>
            smouldering thunder ; and all his excellent companions perished <lb/>
            together, but he himself escaped from the evil Fates : and how <note type="footnote"> 6 According to Eustathius, the grammarians, Aristarehusand Aristo. <lb/>

            lie came to the island Ogygia, and the nymph Calypso, who <lb/>
            indeed detained him, desiring him to be her husband, in her <lb/>
            hollow grot, and nourished him, and said that she would make <lb/>
            him immortal and free from old age all his days: but she did <lb/>
            not by any means persuade his mind in his breast: and how <lb/>
            he came to the Phæacians, having toiled much, who honoured <lb/>
            him in their heart as a god, and escorted him with a ship to <lb/>
            his dear paternal land, giving him brass and gold in abund­ <lb/>
            ance, and garments. This was the last word he said, when <lb/>
            sweet sleep loosing his limbs rushed upon him, relaxing the <lb/>
            cares of his mind. But the blue-eyed goddess Minerva again <lb/>
            thought of other things : when she now expected that Ulysses <lb/>
            was satiated in his mind with the bed of his wife and with <lb/>
            sleep, she immediately excited the golden-throned mother of <lb/>
            dawn from the ocean, that she might give light to mortals: <lb/>
            but Ulysses arose from his soft bed, and enjoined a command <lb/>
            to his wife :</p>
          <p>" O wife, we are now both of us satiated with many <lb/>
            labours ; thou indeed weeping for my toil-fraught return : but <lb/>
            Jove and the other gods bound me anxious from my paternal <lb/>
            land. But now, since both of us have reached our much­ <lb/>
            wished-for bed, take care of the possessions which I have in <lb/>
            the palace: but as to the sheep, which the overbearing suitors <lb/>
            have consumed, I myself will seize many as booty, and the <lb/>
            Greeks shall give others, until they fill all my stalls. But I <lb/>
            indeed am going to the well-wooded farm, to see my excel­ <lb/>
            lent sire, who is continually grieved for me. But to thee, O <lb/>
            wife, I enjoin these things, although thou art prudent: for <lb/>
            forthwith with the rising sun a rumour will go [abroad] con­ <lb/>
            cerning the suitors whom I have slain in the palace. Going <lb/>
            to the upper room, with your women attendants, sit down, nor <lb/>
            look out or inquire of any one."</p>
          <p>He spoke, and around his shoulders he girt hiis beautiful <lb/>
            arms; and he roused Telemachus and the herdsman and <lb/>
            swineherd, and desired all to take their warlike weapons in <lb/>
            their hands. And they did not disobey him: but they were <lb/>
            armed with brass, and they opened the doors and went out <lb/>
            but Ulysses led the way. Now indeed light was upon <lb/>

          <p>Mercury escorts the souls of the slain suitors down to Hades. Ulysses dis­ <lb/>
            covers himself to his father Laertes. By the aid of Minerva they quell an <lb/>
            insurrection of the people, who attempt to revenge the slaughter of the <lb/>
            suitors. Eupeithes, their leader, is slain by Ulysses.</p>
          <p>BUT Cyllenian Mercury called out the souls of the suitors ; <lb/>
            and he held in his hands a beautiful golden rod, with which <lb/>
            he soothes the eyes of men whom he wishes, and upraises <lb/>
            them again when sleeping. With this indeed he drove them, <lb/>
            moving them on; and they gibbering2 followed. And as <lb/>
            when bats in the recess of a divine cave flit about gibbering, <lb/>
            when one falls from the link3 off the rock, and they cling to <lb/>
            one another: so they went together gibbering, and harmless <lb/>
            Mercury led them down the murky4 ways. And they came <lb/>
            near the streams of the ocean and the Leucadian rock, and <lb/>
            they went near the gates of the Sun, and the people of <lb/>
            dreams : and they quickly came to the meadow of Asphodel, <lb/>
            where dwell the souls, the images of the dead. And they <lb/>
            found the soul of Achilles, son of Peleus, and of Patroelus, <lb/>
            and of blameless Antilochus, and of Ajax, who was the most <lb/>
            excellent in form and person of the other Greeks, after the <lb/>
            blameless son of Peleus. Thus they were assembled round <lb/>
            him: but the soul of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, came near <lb/>
            sorrowing; and the others were assembled around him, as <lb/>
            many as had died with him in the house of Ægisthus, and <lb/>
            had drawn on their fate. <note type="footnote"> 1 The objections raised against the authenticity of this portion of the <lb/>

          <p>And him the soul of the son of Peleus addressed first: " O <lb/>
            Atrides, we thought that thou wast all thy days beloved above <lb/>
            heroes by thunder-rejoicing Jove, because thou didst rule <lb/>
            over many and illustrious men, in the people of the Trojans, <lb/>
            where we Grecians suffered griefs. But of a surety pernicious <lb/>
            fate was destined to come upon thee first of all, [fate] which <lb/>
            no one avoids, whoever is born. Now oughtest thou, enjoy­ <lb/>
            in- the honour, over which thou didst rule, to have drawn on <lb/>
            death and fate amongst the people of the Trojans: then would <lb/>
            all the Grecians have made a tomb for thee, and thou wouldst <lb/>
            have obtained great glory for thy son hereafter; but now it <lb/>
            was destined for thee to be overcome by a most miserable <lb/>
            death."</p>
          <p>And him the soul of the son of Atreus addressed in turn: <lb/>
            "Happy son of Peleus, O Achilles, like unto the gods ! thou who <lb/>
            didst fall at Troy, far from Argos: and around thee the other <lb/>
            most excellent sons of the Trojans and Grecians were slain, <lb/>
            fighting for thee : and thou didst lay mighty, and mightily ex­ <lb/>
            tended in a whirlwind of dust, forgetful of horsemanship. <lb/>
            But we fought during the whole day: nor should we at all <lb/>
            have ceased from war, if Jove had not made us stop with a <lb/>
            whirlwind. And when we had brought thee off from the war <lb/>
            to the ships, we laid thee on a couch, cleansing thy beautiful <lb/>
            body with lukewarm water and ointment: and around thee <lb/>
            the Grecians shed many warm tears, and cut their hair. <lb/>
            And thy mother, hearing the news, came from the sea with <lb/>
            the immortal Sea-nymphs;5 and a divine clamour arose over <lb/>
            the sea: and a trembling seized upon all the Grecians: and <lb/>
            now rushing forth they would have gone to the hollow ships, <lb/>
            had not a man detained them, who knew both ancient and <lb/>
            many things, Nestor, whose counsel before also appeared the <lb/>
            best: who thinking well harangued and addressed them: <lb/>
            ‘ Stop, O Argives, fly not, ye youths of the Grecians; this <lb/>
            his mother comes from the sea with the immortal Nymphs of <lb/>
            the sea, to meet her dead son.’6 Thus he spoke; and the <lb/>
            magnanimous Grecians were restrained in their fear. And <lb/>
            around thee stood the daughters of the old man of the sea, <note type="footnote"> 5 For this interpretation I have the authority of the Scholiast, on II. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σ</foreign> <lb/>

            lamenting miserably, and around thee they put immortal <lb/>
            garments. And all the nine Muses, responding with a <lb/>
            beautiful voice, lamented : there thou wouldst have perceived <lb/>
            not one of the Grecians tearless; for so did the tuneful Muse <lb/>
            excite them. There we mourned thee seventeen nights and <lb/>
            days equally, both immortal gods and mortal men ; but on the <lb/>
            eighteenth day we committed thee to the fire, and around <lb/>
            thee slew many very fat sheep and curved-horned oxen. And <lb/>
            thou wast burnt in the clothing of the gods, and in much <lb/>
            ointment, and in sweet honey ; and many Grecian heroes <lb/>
            clashed with their arms around the pile of you burning, both <lb/>
            infantry and cavalry : and much clamour arose. But when <lb/>
            the flame of Vulcan had at length consumed thee, in the <lb/>
            morning we collected thy white bones, O Achilles, in pure <lb/>
            wine and ointment: and thy mother gave us a golden vessel: <lb/>
            and she said it was the gift of Bacchus, and the work of illus­ <lb/>
            trious Vulcan. In this were laid thy white bones, O illustrious <lb/>
            Achilles, and those of dead Patroclus, son of Menætius, mixed <lb/>
            together; but separately those of Antilochus: whom we <lb/>
            honoured chief of all thy other companions, at least after dead <lb/>
            Patroclus. And then we, the sacred army of the warrior <lb/>
            Grecians, heaped up a large and noble tomb around them, on <lb/>
            a projecting shore, in the wide Hellespont:7 so that it might <lb/>
            be seen far off from the sea by those men, who are now born, <lb/>
            and who shall be hereafter. But thy mother, having en­ <lb/>
            treated the gods, proposed very beautiful contests in the <lb/>
            middle of a ring to the chieftains of the Grecians. Already <lb/>
            hast thou met with the burial of many heroes, when, a king <lb/>
            having perished, young men are girded and prepared for the <lb/>
            contests; but on beholding those, thou wouldst have most <lb/>
            marvelled in thy mind, what very beautiful contests the god­ <lb/>
            dess, silver-footed Thetis, made for thee; for thou wast very <lb/>
            dear to the gods. So thou hast not even when dead lost thy <lb/>
            name, but for thee there will ever be excellent fame, O <lb/>
            Achilles, amongst all men ; but what pleasure was this for me, <lb/>
            when I had brought the war to a close ? For on my return <lb/>
            Jove devised miserable destruction for me under the hands of <lb/>
            Ægisthus and my pernicious wife."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke such things to one another. But the <note type="footnote"> <unclear>viz</unclear>. on the promontory of Sigeum. See Cicero pro Archia. </note> <pb n="323"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="99—139."/> <lb/>
            messenger, the slayer of Argus, came near them, bringing the <lb/>
            souls of the suitors who were overcome by Ulysses. But they, <lb/>
            astonished, went straight [to meet them], when they beheld <lb/>
            them. And the soul of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, knew the <lb/>
            son of Melanthius, illustrious Amphimedon: for he had been <lb/>
            his host, inhabiting a house in Ithaca.</p>
          <p>And him the soul of the son of Atreus first addressed : “ O <lb/>
            Amphimedon, to what suffering have ye come beneath the <lb/>
            gloomy earth, all picked men, and of equal age? neither in any <lb/>
            other way would [any one] choosing through a city select the <lb/>
            best men. Whether has Neptune subdued you in ships, <lb/>
            having stirred up difficult winds and long billows ? or have <lb/>
            hostile men by chance destroyed you on the continent whilst <lb/>
            cutting off their bulls, and the beautiful fleeces of sheep ? or <lb/>
            fighting about a city and women ? Tell me, inquiring, for I <lb/>
            boast myself to be thy guest. Dost thou not remember when <lb/>
            I came there to thine house, inciting Ulysses, with godlike <lb/>
            Menelaus, to attend us to Troy, in the well-benched ships ? <lb/>
            But we passed over all the wide sea in a whole8 month, <lb/>
            scarcely persuading city-destroying Ulysses."</p>
          <p>But him the soul of Amphimedon addressed in turn : " [O <lb/>
            most glorious son of Atreus, Agamemnon, king of men,] I re­ <lb/>
            member all these things, and will relate well and accurately <lb/>
            the evil end of our death, what a one befell us. We wooed <lb/>
            the wife of long absent Ulysses: and she did not refuse the <lb/>
            hated marriage, nor did she bring it to a conclusion, devising <lb/>
            death and black Fate for us. But she planned this other <lb/>
            stratagem in her mind ; having begun a mighty web, she <lb/>
            wove it in the palace, slender and round ; and she forthwith <lb/>
            addressed us: ' Youths, my suitors, since divine Ulysses is <lb/>
            dead, cease urging my marriage until I finish the robe, (lest <lb/>
            my threads should perish in vain,) a funeral garment for the <lb/>
            hero Laertes, for the time when the pernicious fate of long- <lb/>
            sleeping death shall seize hold of him: lest any one of the <lb/>
            Grecian women amongst the people should be indignant at <lb/>
            me, if he lies without a shroud, having possessed many things.' <lb/>
            Thus she spoke ; and our noble mind was persuaded. Then <lb/>
            during the day she wove the large web, but at night she un­ <lb/>
            ravelled it, when she placed the torches near her. Thus for <note type="footnote"><unclear/> In English we should say, " we were a whole month passing over the <lb/>
            sea.” </note> <note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note> <pb n="324"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="140—182"/> <lb/>
            three years she escaped notice by deceit, and persuaded the <lb/>
            Grecians. But when the fourth year came, and the hours <lb/>
            advanced, [the months waning, and many days were com­ <lb/>
            pleted,] then indeed some one of the women, who knew it <lb/>
            well, told us, and we found her unravelling the splendid web. <lb/>
            Thus she finished it, although not willing, by necessity. <lb/>
            When she showed the robe-having wove the mighty web, <lb/>
            washing it, like unto the sun or the moon-then an evil deity <lb/>
            brought Ulysses from some where or other to the extremity <lb/>
            of the country, where the swineherd inhabited a dwelling. <lb/>
            There came the beloved son of divine Ulysses, arriving with a <lb/>
            black ship from sandy Pylos. And they, having contrived <lb/>
            evil death for the suitors, came to the illustrious city ; Ulysses <lb/>
            indeed last, but Telemachus first led the way. And the <lb/>
            swineherd brought him, having evil garments on his body, <lb/>
            like unto a wretched beggar and an old man, [leaning upon a <lb/>
            staff: but evil garments were put round his body]. Nor was <lb/>
            any one of us able to know him being [present], having ap­ <lb/>
            peared on a sudden, not even those [of us] who were the <lb/>
            oldest: but we chided him with evil words and with blows. <lb/>
            And he then being beaten and chided in his own palace en­ <lb/>
            dured it with a patient mind; but when the counsel of Ægis- <lb/>
            bearing Jove aroused him, with Telemachus taking the very <lb/>
            beautiful arms, he placed them in a chamber, and fastened the <lb/>
            bolts ; and he through his great cunning ordered his wife to <lb/>
            place the bow and hoary steel for the suitors, as a subject of <lb/>
            contest for us, ill-fated, and a beginning of death. Nor was <lb/>
            any one of us able to stretch the string of the sturdy bow, <lb/>
            but we were very deficient [in strength]. But when the <lb/>
            mighty bow came to the hands of Ulysses, then we all rebuked <lb/>
            him with words, that he should not give him the bow, although <lb/>
            he spoke very many things: but Telemachus alone urging <lb/>
            commanded him. And milch-enduring divine Ulysses received <lb/>
            it in his hand, and he easily bent the bow, and sent [the shaft] I <lb/>
            through the steel. And he stood going up on the threshold, <lb/>
            and he poured out the swift arrows, looking about terribly: <lb/>
            and he smote king Antinous. And then he sent forth his <lb/>
            grievous shafts against others, taking aim opposite: and they <lb/>
            fell near one another. But it was evident that some one <lb/>
            of the gods was an ally to him. For immediately following <lb/>
            upon us with their might through the dwelling, they slew us <pb n="325"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="188—219."/> <lb/>
            upon all sides: and an unseemly groaning arose from them,9 <lb/>
            their heads being stricken, and the whole pavement bubbled <lb/>
            with blood. Thus did we perish, O Agamemnon, whose bodies <lb/>
            even now lie without funeral rites in the palace of Ulysses : for <lb/>
            our friends do not yet know in the dwellings of each, who, <lb/>
            having washed the black gore from our wounds, laying us <lb/>
            down would mourn for us: for this is the honour of the dead."</p>
          <p>And him the soul of the son of Atreus addressed in turn : <lb/>
            “ O happy son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses, surely <lb/>
            didst thou gain thy wife with great valour. How excellent <lb/>
            was the mind of blameless Penelope, daughter of Icarus, how <lb/>
            mindful of Ulysses, her virgin husband : unto whom the glory <lb/>
            of his virtue shall never perish; but the immortals will make <lb/>
            for those on earth a beautiful song for prudent Penelope. Not <lb/>
            so did the daughter of Tyndarus contrive evil deeds, slaying <lb/>
            her virgin husband : but [for her] there will be a hateful song <lb/>
            amongst men ; and she has given an evil fame to women, even <lb/>
            though one be a worker of good." Thus they spoke such <lb/>
            things to one another, standing in the houses of Pluto, under <lb/>
            the hiding-places of the earth.</p>
          <p>But they, when they went from the city, soon reached the <lb/>
            beautiful-constructed farm of Laertes, which Laertes had him­ <lb/>
            self acquired, since he had toiled very much: there was his <lb/>
            house, and a shed10 ran round it on all sides, in which his ne­ <lb/>
            cessary servants fed, and sat, and took rest, who worked what <lb/>
            was agreeable to him.11 And in it there was a Sicilian old <lb/>
            woman, who diligently took care of the old man at the farm, <lb/>
            away from the city. Then Ulysses spoke words to his serv­ <lb/>
            ants and his son:</p>
          <p>" Do you now go within the well-built house ; and quickly <lb/>
            sacrifice a meal of swine, whichever is the best. But I will <lb/>
            try my father, whether he will know me, and perceive me with <lb/>
            his eyes, or whether he will not recognise me, having been <lb/>
            away for a long time."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he gave his warlike arms to his serv­ <lb/>
            ants. They then quickly came to the house; but Ulysses <note type="footnote"> 9 The suitors. </note><note type="footnote"> 10 Ernesti observes that the house of Laertes stood in the middle, be­ <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="220—261."/> <lb/>
            went near the fruitful vineyard to try [his father]: nor did <lb/>
            lie find Dolius, on going down to the great orchard, nor any of <lb/>
            his servants or sons : but they indeed had gone to gather heaps <lb/>
            of stones to be a fence for the vineyard : but the old man led <lb/>
            the way for them. And he found his father alone in the well- <lb/>
            made vineyard, hoeing a plant: and he was clad in a sordid <lb/>
            garment, patched, unseemly: and around his thighs he had <lb/>
            bound patched greaves of bull's hide, to avoid the tearings [of <lb/>
            the thorns] ;12 and gloves upon his hands on account of the <lb/>
            brambles: but above he had a cap of goat-skin on his head, <lb/>
            giving way to his grief. When then much-enduring divine <lb/>
            Ulysses saw him wasted with old age, and having great grief <lb/>
            in his mind, standing under a lofty pear-tree, he shed a tear. <lb/>
            Then he meditated in his soul and in his mind, whether to <lb/>
            kiss and embrace his father, and tell [him] every thing, how <lb/>
            he came to and reached his paternal land; or, whether he <lb/>
            should first inquire of him, and try him in every thing. And <lb/>
            thus it appeared to him to be better as he considered, first to <lb/>
            try him with reproaching words. Having this intention, di­ <lb/>
            vine Ulysses went straight opposite to him ; he indeed, holding <lb/>
            down his head, was digging round a plant, but standing near <lb/>
            him his illustrious son addressed him:</p>
          <p>" O old man, want of skill does not possess thee in man­ <lb/>
            aging an orchard ; but thy care keeps it well; nor is there any <lb/>
            plant at all, either fig-tree, or vine, or olive, or pear, or border <lb/>
            in the garden destitute of care. But I tell thee something <lb/>
            else, but do not thou lay up anger in thy mind : good care does <lb/>
            not keep thyself, but thou hast miserable old age at the same <lb/>
            time, and thou art evilly squalid, and art clothed in unseemly <lb/>
            guise. Thy master does not indeed take care of you [so ill] <lb/>
            on account of thy idleness, nor is thy form or size at all ser­ <lb/>
            vile to behold ; for thou art like unto a king. Thou art like <lb/>
            one who ought, when he has washed and eaten, to sleep softly : <lb/>
            for this is the right of old men. But come, tell me this, and <lb/>
            relate it correctly, whose servant art thou ? whose orchard <lb/>
            dost thou tend ? and relate this truly to me, that I may well <lb/>
            know, if indeed I am come to Ithaca, as this man told me, who <lb/>
            just now met me, as I was coming hither, one not very wise: <lb/>
            since he did not endure to tell me every thing, or to listen to <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_48_fig30.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="327"/>
              <note type="correspondsTo" n="262—302"/> <lb/>
              my word, when I inquired of him concerning my host, whether <lb/>
              he is alive and exists, or is now dead and in the house of Pluto. <lb/>
              For I tell thee plainly, and do thou attend, and listen to me: <lb/>
              I once entertained a man in my dear paternal land, having <lb/>
              come to my house, and never yet has any other mortal of <lb/>
              foreign strangers come more welcome to my house. He <lb/>
              boasted his race to be of Ithaci, and he said that his father <lb/>
              was Laertes, son of Arcesias. Him I entertained well, bringing <lb/>
              him to my house, receiving him carefully, when many were <lb/>
              in my house, and gave him hospitable presents, such as are <lb/>
              becoming. I gave him seven talents of well-wrought gold, <lb/>
              and I gave him a cup all silver, embossed with flowers, twelve <lb/>
              single cloaks and as many pieces of tapestry, and as many <lb/>
              beautiful robes, and as many tunics added to these: besides <lb/>
              four beautiful women, skilled in blameless works, whom he <lb/>
              himself wished to take."</p>
          <p>But him his father then answered, shedding a tear : <lb/>
            "Stranger, thou indeed art come to the land, concerning <lb/>
            which thou inquirest: but insolent and infatuated men possess <lb/>
            it. But thou hast conferred these thy gifts in vain, giving <lb/>
            numberless [presents] ; for would that thou hadst found him <lb/>
            alive amongst the people of Ithaca, then would he have sent <lb/>
            thee away, having requited thee with presents and good en­ <lb/>
            tertainment ; for it is the right [of him], whoever begins. <lb/>
            But. come, tell me this, and relate it truly, how many years is <lb/>
            it since thou didst entertain him thine unhappy guest, my son ? <lb/>
            if he was so ; wretched one, whom some where, far away from <lb/>
            his friends and paternal land, either the fish have eaten in the <lb/>
            sea, or he has become a prey to the beasts and birds on the <lb/>
            shore: nor did his mother mourn him, covering him around, <lb/>
            nor his father, we who gave him birth: nor did his well­ <lb/>
            dowered wife, prudent Penelope, wail for her dear husband in <lb/>
            her bed, as was fitting, wasting away her eyes: for this is the <lb/>
            honour of the dead. And tell me this truly, that I may know <lb/>
            it well; who art thou ? from whence art thou amongst men ? <lb/>
            where are thy city and thy parents ? where is the swift ship <lb/>
            stationed, which brought thee and thy godlike companions <lb/>
            hither? or hast thou come a passenger on another man's ship, <lb/>
            and have they gone, having landed thee on shore?"</p>
          <p>But him much-planning Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            " Therefore will I tell thee these things very accurately. For <pb n="328"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="303—341."/> <lb/>
            I am from Alybas, where I inhabit an illustrous dwelling, the <lb/>
            SOil of Apheidas, son of king Polypemon, and my name is <lb/>
            Eperitus: but the deity made me wander so that I should <lb/>
            come hither from Sicania, against my will: but my ship is <unclear/> <lb/>
            totioned over against a field at a distance from the city. But <lb/>
            this is now the fifth year since Ulysses went away from <lb/>
            thence, and departed from my country, unhappy one: but <lb/>
            there were excellent birds13 on the right for him as he was <lb/>
            going, in which I rejoicing sent him away, and he rejoiced as <lb/>
            he went: and our mind still hoped to be mixed in hospitality, <lb/>
            and to bestow glorious gifts."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and a black cloud of grief covered him : <lb/>
            and taking up the dust of ashes in both his hands, he poured <lb/>
            it upon his hoary head, groaning continually. But his <lb/>
            mind waa excited, and now vehement passion beat against his <lb/>
            nostrils, as he beheld his dear father. And he kissed him, <lb/>
            embracing him and leaping upon him, and he addressed himin</p>
          <p>“ That one himself indeed am I, O father, after whom thou <lb/>
            inquirest, I am come in the twentieth year to my paternal <lb/>
            land. But refrain from weeping and tearful mourning. For <lb/>
            I tell the plainly; (but it is by all means fit to hasten ;) I <lb/>
            have slain the suitors in my palace, revenging their grievous <lb/>
            insolence and evil deeds."</p>
          <p>But him Laertes answered again, and addressed him: "If <lb/>
            indeed thou art Ulysses, my son, and hast come here, tell me <lb/>
            now some evident sign, that I may believe it."</p>
          <p>But him much-counselling Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            “ First regard the scar with thine eyes, which a boar inflicted <lb/>
            on me with its white tusk in Parnassus, when I went there: <lb/>
            but thou didst send me on, and my venerable mother, to Au­ <lb/>
            tolycus, the dear father of my mother, that I might receive the <lb/>
            gifts, which he promised me on coming here, and declared <lb/>
            that he would give me. Come, I will recount to thee the trees <lb/>
            also, through the well-made vineyard, which once thou gavest <lb/>
            me, for I asked each of thee, being a child, following thee <lb/>
            through the garden: but we came through them, and thou <lb/>
            didst name them and didst tell me each. Thou gavest me <lb/>
            thirteen pear-trees, and ten apple-trees, and forty fig-trees: <lb/>
            and thus thou saidst thou wouldst give me fifty rows of vines, <note type="footnote"> Is i. e. omens. </note> <pb n="329"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="312—380."/> <lb/>
            and each was sown between with corn : but there are all kinds <lb/>
            of grapes, when the seasons of Jove come heavy upon them.”</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, but his knees and heart were loosed, as he <lb/>
            recognised the signs, which Ulysses told him truly. And he <lb/>
            threw his arms around his dear son : and much-enduring di­ <lb/>
            vine Ulysses drew him fainting to him. But when he re­ <lb/>
            covered, and his mind was raised to his breast, he immediately <lb/>
            answering addressed him :</p>
          <p>" O father Jove, surely ye gods14 are still in lofty Olympus, <lb/>
            if indeed the suitors have paid for their infatuate insolence. <lb/>
            But now I very much dread in my mind, lest all the Ithacans <lb/>
            should soon come here, and hasten messages on all sides to <lb/>
            the cities of the Cephallenians."</p>
          <p>But him much-counselling Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            " Be of good cheer, let not these things be a care to thee in <lb/>
            thy mind: but let us go to the house which lies near the <lb/>
            orchard. For there I sent forward Telemachus and the herds­ <lb/>
            man and swineherd, that they may get ready supper as quickly <lb/>
            as possible."</p>
          <p>Thus having conversed, the two went to the beautiful <lb/>
            house. But when they now reached the well-built dwelling, <lb/>
            they found Telemachus and the herdsman and swineherd cut­ <lb/>
            ting up much meat, and mixing the dark wine. But in the <lb/>
            mean time the Sicilian handmaiden washed magnanimous <lb/>
            Laertes in his house, and anointed him with oil: and site <lb/>
            threw a beautiful cloak around him, and Minerva standing <lb/>
            near increased the limbs of the shepherd of the people, and <lb/>
            made him mightier and stouter to behold than before. And <lb/>
            he went out of the bath : but his dear son marvelled at him, <lb/>
            when he saw him with his eyes, like unto the immortal gods <lb/>
            to look at. And addressing him, he spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>“ O father, certainly some one of the immortal gods has <lb/>
            made thee noble in thy form and size to behold."</p>
          <p>The prudent Laertes answered him in turn: " For would <lb/>
            that I, O father Jove, and Minerva, and Apollo, such as when <lb/>
            I took Nericus a well-built citadel, a town of the continent, <lb/>
            ruling over the Cephallenians, being such a one yesterday in <lb/>
            our palace, having arms upon my shoulders, I had stood <lb/>
            against and warded off the suitors: then would I have loosed <note type="footnote"> 14 See Duport, Gnom. Horn. p. 288, sq. </note> <pb n="330"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="381—418."/> <lb/>
            the knees of many of them in the palace, and thou shouidst <lb/>
            have rejoiced in thy mind within thee."</p>
          <p>Thus they spoke to one another. But they, when they <lb/>
            had ceased from their labour, and prepared the feast, sat <lb/>
            down in order on benches and thrones: then they laid their <lb/>
            hands on the meal: and the old man Dolius came near them, <lb/>
            and with him the sons of the old man, labouring from their <lb/>
            toils, for the mother, the Sicilian old woman, who nourished <lb/>
            them, went and called them: and she diligently took care of <lb/>
            tne old man, since old age had seized upon him. But they, <lb/>
            when they beheld Ulysses, and considered him in their mind, <lb/>
            stood astonished in the palace; but Ulysses reproving them <lb/>
            with gentle words, addressed them :</p>
          <p>" O old man, sit down to the meal, and do ye forget aston­ <lb/>
            ishment : for we remain in the palace for a long time, eager to <lb/>
            lay our hands upon the viands, still expecting you."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and Dolius went straight to him, stretching <lb/>
            out both his hands ; and taking the hand of Ulysses, he kissed <lb/>
            it at the wrist, and addressing him spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>" O dear one; since thou hast returned to us wishing [for <lb/>
            thee], but not expecting thee, but the gods have brought thee, <lb/>
            hail! and rejoice greatly, and may the gods give thee pros­ <lb/>
            perity. And tell me this truly, that I may know it well, <lb/>
            whether does prudent Penelope already know that thou hast <lb/>
            returned hither, or shall we urge on a messenger?"</p>
          <p>And him much-counselling Ulysses answering addressed: <lb/>
            " Old man, she already knows it, what need is there for thee <lb/>
            to care about these matters?"</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; and he again sat down upon the well- <lb/>
            polished seat. In like manner the sons of Dolius saluted <lb/>
            illustrious Ulysses with words, and took hold of his hands; <lb/>
            and they sat down in order near Dolius their father. Thus <lb/>
            then they prepared a meal in the palace.</p>
          <p>Now a report swiftly went as a messenger every where <lb/>
            through the city, telling of the hateful death and Fate of the <lb/>
            suitors. But they, as soon as they heard it, went one one way, <lb/>
            one another, with murmuring and groaning before the house <lb/>
            of Ulysses : and they carried the dead bodies out of the house, <lb/>
            and each buried them. But those from other cities they <lb/>
            sent to fishermen to take each [to his own] home, placing <lb/>
            them in their swift ships: and they went together to the <pb n="331"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="119—459."/> <lb/>
            forum, sorrowing in their heart. But when they were assem­ <lb/>
            bled, and were collected together, Eupithes rose up, and ad­ <lb/>
            dressed them, for not-to-be-forgotten grief lay upon his mind <lb/>
            for his son, Antinous, whom divine Ulysses slew first: for <lb/>
            whom he pouring forth tears, harangued and addressed them :</p>
          <p>“ O friends, indeed this man has done a heinous deed <lb/>
            against the Grecians ; some indeed taking in his ships, many <lb/>
            and brave men, he has lost his hollow ships, and destroyed <lb/>
            all15 the people; but others he has slain on his return, far the <lb/>
            best of the Cephallenians. But come, before this man either <lb/>
            quickly reaches Pylos, or divine Elis, where the Epeians rule, <lb/>
            let us go; or hereafter we shall always be ashamed. For <lb/>
            these things indeed are a disgrace even for posterity to hear. <lb/>
            But if we shall not be revenged on the murderers of our sons <lb/>
            and brothers, it would not be pleasant for me in my mind to <lb/>
            live: but dying as soon as possible, might I be amongst the <lb/>
            deceased. But let us go, lest they anticipate us, passing over."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, shedding tears, and pity seized all the <lb/>
            Grecians. But Medon and the divine bard came near them <lb/>
            from the palace of Ulysses, when sleep had left them. And <lb/>
            they stood in the middle; and astonishment seized each man. <lb/>
            And Medon, knowing prudent things, addressed them:</p>
          <p>" Hear me now, Ithacans ; for Ulysses did not devise these <lb/>
            deeds without the will of the gods ; I myself saw an immortal <lb/>
            god, who stood near Ulysses, and he was in every thing like unto <lb/>
            Mentor. But the immortal god at one time appeared before <lb/>
            Ulysses, encouraging him, and at another inciting the suitors, <lb/>
            made them rush in flight through the palace; and they fell <lb/>
            near to one another."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; and pale fear seized upon all of them. And <lb/>
            the old hero Alitberses, son of Master, addressed them; for <lb/>
            he alone saw what was past and what was to come ; he, think­ <lb/>
            ing well, harangued and addressed them:</p>
          <p>" Listen now, Ithacans, to what I am going to say. These <lb/>
            deeds, my friends, were done by your own wickedness: for <lb/>
            ye did not obey me nor Mentor, the shepherd of the people, so <lb/>
            as to make your sons cease from their foolish deeds ; who have <lb/>
            done a heinous deed through their evil infatuation, wasting <lb/>
            the property and insulting the wife of an excellent man, who <note type="footnote"> 15 Observe the tenesis for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπώλεσε</foreign>. </note> <pb n="332"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="459—499."/> <lb/>
            they thought would no more return. And now may it happen <lb/>
            thus: obey me, according as I advise; let us not go, lest by <lb/>
            chance some one should meet with an evil drawn upon him­ <lb/>
            self."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but they rushed out with a great shout, <lb/>
            more than half of them ; but the rest remained there together. <lb/>
            For what he said did not please them in their mind, but they <lb/>
            obeyed Eupithes : and quickly then they rushed to arms. But <lb/>
            when they had put the shining brass around their bodies, they <lb/>
            were assembled together before the wide-wayed city. But <lb/>
            Eupithes led them in their folly: and he said that he would <lb/>
            revenge the murder of his son ; nor was he destined to return <lb/>
            back, but to draw on his fate there. But Minerva addressed <lb/>
            Jupiter, the son of Saturn :</p>
          <p>" O father mine, thou son of Saturn, highest of kings, tell <lb/>
            me, asking, what does thy mind now conceal within it? whether <lb/>
            wilt thou first cause evil war and terrible strife? or hast thou <lb/>
            made friendship on both sides?"</p>
          <p>But her cloud-compelling Jove answering addressed: " My <lb/>
            child, why dost thou ask and inquire of me these things? <lb/>
            For hast not thou thyself devised this plan, that Ulysses <lb/>
            having returned should be revenged upon them ? Do as thou <lb/>
            wilt: but I tell thee how it is fitting. Since divine Ulysses <lb/>
            has been revenged on the suitors, making faithful oaths, let <lb/>
            him always reign, but let us make oblivion of the deaths of <lb/>
            their sons and brothers ; and let them love one another as be­ <lb/>
            fore ; and let there be wealth and peace in abundance."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he incited Minerva, who was before <lb/>
            eager, and she went rushing down from the tops of Olympus. <lb/>
            But when they had taken away the desire of sweet food, much- <lb/>
            enduring divine Ulysses began speaking to them : “ Let some <lb/>
            one, going out, see whether they are coming near."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke ; but a son of Dolius went out, as he desired; <lb/>
            and going he stood on the threshold, and he saw all of them <lb/>
            near at hand : and immediately he addressed to Ulysses winged <lb/>
            words:</p>
          <p>" They are now near, but let us arm ourselves quickly." <lb/>
            Thus he spoke ; but they rose up, and were clad in their arms, <lb/>
            the four with Ulysses, and the six sons of Dolius ; and with <lb/>
            them Laertes and Dolius put on their arms, although they <lb/>
            were hoary, warriors through necessity. But when they had <pb n="333"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="499-537."/> <lb/>
            put the shining brass around their bodies, they opened the <lb/>
            gates, and went out, but Ulysses led the way. And Minerva, <lb/>
            the daughter of Jove, came near them, likened unto Mentor <lb/>
            both in person and voice. Mueh-enduring divine Ulysses re­ <lb/>
            joiced on seeing her, and he immediately addressed his dear son <lb/>
            Telemachus :</p>
          <p>" Telemachus, thou wilt now know this thyself, coming on, <lb/>
            (when men are fighting, where the best are judged to be,) not <lb/>
            to disgrace the race of your fathers, we, who before excelled <lb/>
            over all the earth in valour and manliness.”</p>
          <p>But him prudent Telemachus <unclear>swered</unclear> in turn: " Thou <lb/>
            shalt see if thou desirest, my dear father, in my mind, that I <lb/>
            dishonour not the race, as thou sayest."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke; but Laertes rejoiced, and spoke thus: <lb/>
            “ What day now is this, my dear friends ? Very much do I <lb/>
            rejoice ; my son and my grandson are having a contention <lb/>
            about excellence."</p>
          <p>But blue-eyed Minerva standing near addressed him : “0 <lb/>
            son of Areesias, far dearest of all my companions, praying to <lb/>
            the blue-eyed damsel, and father Jove, very quickly brandish, <lb/>
            and send forth a long-shadowing spear."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke; and Pallas Minerva breathed into him <lb/>
            great strength ; then praying to the daughter of mighty Jove, <lb/>
            he very quickly brandished and sent forth a long-shadowing <lb/>
            spear, and struck Eupithes through the brazen-cheeked helm; <lb/>
            but it did not keep off the spear, but the brass passed entirely <lb/>
            through. And he resounded as he fell, and his arms clashed <lb/>
            upon him. And Ulysses and his glorious son fell upon the <lb/>
            first-fighters ; and they beat them with swords and double- <lb/>
            edged spears. And now they would have destroyed all, and <lb/>
            deprived them of their return, had not Minerva, the daughter <lb/>
            of Ægis-bearing Jove, cried out with her loud voice and re­ <lb/>
            strained all the people: " Refrain from difficult war, O Itha­ <lb/>
            cans, that without bloodshed ye may be separated as soon as <lb/>
            possible."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Minerva; and pale fear seized them; and the <lb/>
            weapons flew from the hands of the frightened, and all fell on <lb/>
            the earth, when the goddess had uttered a sound; and they <lb/>
            were turned towards the city, anxious for their lives. But <lb/>
            much-enduring divine Ulysses shouted out terribly, and he <lb/>
            rushed on, gathering himself up like a lofty-flying eagle. And <pb n="334"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="538-547"/> <lb/>
            then at length the son of Saturn sent forth a smouldering <lb/>
            thunderbolt, and it fell before the blue-eyed [daughter] of <lb/>
            an illustrious sire. And then blue-eyed Minerva addressed <lb/>
            Ulysses:</p>
          <p>“<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ο</foreign> noble son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses, refrain; <lb/>
            and check the contest of equally destructive war, lest by chance <lb/>
            far-sounding Jove, son of Saturn, be wrath with thee."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Minerva ; and he obeyed, and rejoiced in his <lb/>
            mind. Afterwards Pallas Minerva, daughter of Ægis-bearing <lb/>
            Jove, propounded oaths to both sides, likened unto Mentor, <lb/>
            both in person and in her voice.</p><pb n="335"/>

            <title type="main">PREFACE TO THE BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MICE.</title>
          </head>
          <p>WHOEVER be the author of this little poem, it is replete with <lb/>
            legitimate humour, and evinces no ordinary taste for parody. <lb/>
            I cannot give a better sketch of its contents than in the words <lb/>
            of Coleridge, whose analysis is as follows:</p>
          <p>"A mouse, Psicharphax (Crumb-Filcher), exhausted with <lb/>
            flying from a weasel, came to a pool to drink; a wanton frog <lb/>
            Physignathus (Puff-Cheeks), having apparently never seen <lb/>
            such a wild-fowl before, enters into conversation with him, <lb/>
            the result of which is that the mouse mounts upon frog's back, <lb/>
            and goes to sea. It should seem that frog meant to be honest, <lb/>
            but a water-snake lifting up his head at no great distance, he <lb/>
            is so frightened, that, forgetful of his poor landsman, down <lb/>
            he dives to the bottom. Crumb-Filcher struggles, sputters, <lb/>
            makes a speech denouncing his perfidious betrayer to the <lb/>
            vengeance of every feeling mouse, and then sinks amongst <lb/>
            the bulrushes. The deceased was son and heir of the king <lb/>
            of the mice, (a weasel and a. gin had bereaved him of two <lb/>
            brothers,) and his father, by his influence, induces every <lb/>
            mouse in the field to take arms and avenge him of the inju­ <lb/>
            nous frog. The frogs perceive the bustle ; and, arming them­ <lb/>
            selves, are foolish enough to leave their more proper element, <lb/>
            and meet their assailants on dry land. Meantime Jupiter <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            holds a council on the subject, but at the suggestion of Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva—who, though extremely angry with the mice for nib­ <lb/>
            bling one of her petticoats into rags, is still so incensed with <lb/>
            the frogs for depriving her of sleep, that she will assist neither <lb/>
            party—it is resolved that the gods shall be passive spectators <lb/>
            of the contest. The battle begins: great prowess is dis­ <lb/>
            played on either side; but at length the mice get the better, <lb/>
            and the entire race of frogs is on the very point of extermina­ <lb/>
            tion, when Jupiter interferes with lightning and thunder. <lb/>
            The mice, however, pay no attention to these hints of the <lb/>
            divine will, and are pursuing their advantage, when Jupiter, <lb/>
            as a last resource, orders a detachment of crabs to make an <lb/>
            echelon movement upon the victors. This manoeuvre effectu­ <lb/>
            ally checks the mice, who, some with their tails, and some <lb/>
            with legs bitten off, retire to their holes, and leave the rem­ <lb/>
            nant of the frogs to croak dolefully over their defeat and loss.”</p><pb n="337"/>

              boundless strife, a war-clattering deed of Mars, desiring all <lb/>
              men to receive it into their ears-how that the mice went <lb/>
              victorious against the frogs, imitating the deeds of the earth- <lb/>
              born hero giants, as was the report among men. Now it had <lb/>
              such an origin.</p>
          <p>Once on a time a thirsting mouse having escaped danger <lb/>
            from a weasel,3 dipped his smooth4 beard into a lake near at <lb/>

          <p>" Stranger, who art thou ? Whence comest thou to the <lb/>
            shore? And who begat thee? Speak all things truly, lest I <lb/>
            catch thee telling falsehoods. For if I perceive thee to be a <lb/>
            proper friend, I will lead thee to my dwelling, and will give <lb/>
            thee gifts of hospitality, numerous and good. Now I am king <lb/>

            all days ruling over the frogs. And Muddy, my sire, of erst <lb/>

            king, and a warrior in battles.6 But come, quickly detail thy <lb/>

          <p>But him Crumb-Filcher answered and addressed:</p>
          <p>“ Why askest thou concerning my race, which is well <lb/>

            forwards to the fight, I have mingled with the foremost com­ <lb/>

            catch him by the heel, nor does pain attack the man, nor9 <lb/>
            does sweet sleep leave him, when I bite. But there are two <lb/>
            [creatures alone] which I dread very much throughout the <lb/>
            whole earth, the hawk 10 and the weasel, who bring great <lb/>
            grief upon me, and the lamentable trap, where there is death <lb/>
            by stratagem. But above all I dread the weasel, which is <lb/>
            excellent [in cunning], which even in my hole hunts [me] <lb/>
            out, when taking refuge in my hole.11 I do not eat radishes, <lb/>

          <p>To this Puff-Cheeks, smiling, answered thus: " O stranger, <lb/>
            thou boastest too much of the belly. Among us, also, both <lb/>

            very quickly, putting his hands round his smooth neck, with <lb/>
            a nimble leap. And at first he rejoiced, when he beheld tho <lb/>
            harbours near at hand, delighting himself with the swimming <lb/>
            of Puff-Cheeks. But when he was now buried under the <lb/>
            purple waves, weeping much, he lamented with too-late re­ <lb/>
            pentance, and plucked out his hairs, and drew up his feet to <lb/>
            his belly,13 and his heart palpitated unusually,14 and he longed <lb/>
            to reach the land. And dreadfully he groaned under the <lb/>
            pressure of chill fear. But there suddenly appeared a water- <lb/>
            serpent, a dreadful sight to both, and raised his neck straight <lb/>
            up above the water. Seeing him, Puff-Cheeks dived down, <lb/>
            in no wise reflecting what a companion he was about to leave <lb/>
            to perish. And he went to the depth of the marsh, and <lb/>
            avoided black fate; but he, (the mouse,) immediately he was <lb/>
            let go, fell on his back in the water, and he cramped up his <lb/>
            hands, and perishing, squeaked. Oftentimes indeed lie sank <lb/>
            beneath the water, and oftentimes again he came to the sur­ <lb/>
            face, kicking about, but it was not permitted him to avoid his <lb/>
            destiny. First he stretched his tail over the waters, drawing <lb/>
            it along like an oar, and, beseeching the gods that he might <lb/>
            reach the land, he was washed away by the purple waves. <lb/>
            And much he clamoured, and spake such a discourse, and <lb/>
            harangued with his voice:</p>
          <p>" Not thus' did a bull bear the burthen of love on his <lb/>

            stream." But his moistened hairs drew a very great weight <lb/>
            upon him, and at length, perishing, lie spoke such words :</p>
          <p>" Thou shalt not escape notice, O Puff-Cheeks, having done <lb/>
            these things deceitfully, having cast [me] shipwrecked from <lb/>
            thy body, as from a rock.16 On the earth, O basest one, thou <lb/>
            wast not my better in the pancratium, nor in wrestling, nor <lb/>
            the course.17 But having deluded me, thou hast cast me into <lb/>
            the water. God has an avenging eye, who, forsooth, will <lb/>
            straightway requite a just punishment18 and revenge, (with <lb/>
            which indeed the army of the mice shall punish thee, nor shalt <lb/>
            thou escape.)"</p>
          <p>Having spoken thus, he breathed his last in the water, but <lb/>
            him Lick-Dish perceived, as he sate upon the soft banks, (and <lb/>
            he truly went to the mice, a most swift messenger of his fate,) <lb/>
            and he uttered a dreadful cry, and ran and told it to the mice.19</p>
          <p>But when they heard [their companion's] fate, bitter wrath <lb/>
            entered them all, and they then gave orders to their heralds, <lb/>
            at dawn to summon a council to the house of Bread-Muncher, <lb/>
            the unhappy sire of Crumb-Filcher, who was floating on his <lb/>
            back in the marsh, a lifeless corse, nor was unhappy he any <lb/>
            longer near the banks, but was swimming in the middle of the <lb/>
            stream. But when they hastening came at dawn, first arose <lb/>
            Bread-Muncher, enraged on account of his son, and spoke thus :</p>
          <p>“ O friends,20 although I alone among the frogs have suf­ <lb/>
            fered many ills, yet evil fate is the appointed destiny of all. <lb/>

            For the first, indeed, a most hateful weasel slew, having <lb/>
            snatched him away, catching him outside his hole. But an­ <lb/>
            other, in tarn, ruthless men brought to his doom, having, by <lb/>
            a new art, discovered a wooden engine, which they call a trap, <lb/>
            being a destruction to mice. The third was beloved by me <lb/>
            and his revered mother—him has Puff-Cheeks suffocated, <lb/>
            leading him into the deep. But come, let us be armed, and <lb/>
            go forth against them, having equipped our bodies in varie­ <lb/>
            gated arms."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he persuaded them all to be armed. <lb/>
            and them did Mars, who has a care for war, urge on [to the <lb/>
            fight]. First indeed they placed greaves around their shins, <lb/>
            having broken off, and deftly worked, green bean [shells], <lb/>
            which21 they themselves, coming by night, had devoured. <lb/>
            And they had breastplates made of reed-strengthened skins,22 <lb/>
            which, having stripped a weasel, they had skillfully made. <lb/>
            But their shield was the boss of a lamp, while their spear was <lb/>
            a good long needle, the all-brazen work of Mars. But the <lb/>
            helmet on their foreheads was the shell of a nut.</p>
          <p>Thus indeed were the mice armed; but when the frogs per­ <lb/>
            ceived [it], they swam up out of the water, and coming into <lb/>
            one place, they assembled a council concerning evil war. <lb/>
            But while they were considering whence [was] the tumult, <lb/>
            and what the gathering, a herald came near, bearing a staff <lb/>
            in his hands, Pot-Stalker, the son of great-souled Cheese- <lb/>
            Scooper, bearing news of the evil report of war, and he spoke <lb/>
            thus: <note type="footnote"> 21 i. e. the beans, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύαμους</foreign> must be taken both for the shell and the <lb/>

            " First on each leg the green shales of a bean <lb/>

            base ones now charge me who am innocent. But come, let <lb/>
            let us seek counsel, how we may utterly destroy these deceit­ <lb/>
            ful mice. Wherefore I will speak, as seems to me to be best. <lb/>
            Having arrayed our bodies in arms, let us all make a stand <lb/>
            near the furthermost brinks, where the land is precipitous. <lb/>
            But when making an onslaught against us, they come out, <lb/>
            having seized them by the helmets, whosoever shall come <lb/>
            near against us, let us hurl them straight into the marsh with <lb/>
            them,23 For thus having choked in the waters these creatures <lb/>
            who cannot swim, we may here, with a good courage, upraise <lb/>
            a trophy over the slain mice."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he clad them all in arms. With the <lb/>
            leaves of mallows indeed they surrounded their shins, and they <lb/>
            had breastplates made from wide, fresh beets, and they had <lb/>
            well prepared the leaves of cabbages for shields, and a long <lb/>
            sharp reed was fitted to each as a spear, and helmets of light <lb/>
            cockle-shells encircled their heads with a defence. And hav­ <lb/>
            in- armed themselves, they stood upon the high banks, brand­ <lb/>
            ishing their spears, and were each filled with wrath.</p>
          <p>But Jove, having summoned the gods to the starry heaven; <lb/>
            and having pointed out the forces of war, and the valiant com­ <lb/>
            batants, both numerous and mighty, and bearing long spears, <lb/>
            such an army as comes of the centaurs and giants-smiling <lb/>
            pleasantly, he asked, who of the immortals would be allies to <lb/>
            the frogs, or to the mice, and addressed Minerva:</p>
          <p>" O daughter, goest thou in order to bear aid to the mice ? <lb/>
            For of a truth they are all continually leaping about thy tem­ <lb/>
            ple, where they are delighted with the steam and delicacies <lb/>
            from the offerings.” <note type="footnote"> a See Eruesti. </note> <pb n="344"/>
            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="176—198"/>
          <p>Thus spake the son of Saturn, but him Minerva addressed: <lb/>
            " O father, never will I come as an assistant to the mice in <lb/>
            trouble, since they have done me many ills, having befouled <lb/>
            my garlands, and lamps, for the sake of the oil. But this <lb/>
            thing, such as they have done, has particularly eaten into my <lb/>
            soul, they have nibbled away a garment, which I had worked <lb/>
            with mine own toil, of delicate thread, and I wove a delicate <lb/>
            web, and they have made holes in it. But the † weaver24 presses <lb/>
            me, and demands usury of me, [andj on this account I am <lb/>
            worn out. For having borrowed,† I worked it, and have not <lb/>
            the wherewithal to pay back. But even thus I shall not be <lb/>
            willing to aid the frogs. For neither are they discreet in <lb/>
            mind, but yesterday, when I was returning from battle, when <lb/>
            I was very tired, and wanted to sleep, they, making a noise, <lb/>
            would not suffer me to close my eyes even for a minute,25 and <lb/>
            I lay sleepless with a headache, until the cock crowed. But <lb/>
            come, let us gods avoid siding these, lest some one of us be <lb/>
            wounded by a sharp dart, [and lest any one be stricken as <lb/>
            to his body with a spear or a sword ;] 26 for they are going to <lb/>
            fight hand to hand, even if a god were to come against them, <lb/>
            and let us all be amused, beholding the strife from heaven."</p>
          <p>Thus then she spoke, and her the other gods all obeyed. <lb/>
            But they all at once came together into one place, and two <lb/>
            heralds, bearing the portent27 of war, and then [with them] <note type="footnote"> 21 Chapman renders <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠπητής</foreign>, a darner. But there is much difficulty <lb/>
            in the whole passage. Coleridge, Introduction, p. 282, says, “I do not <lb/>
            pretend to understand this passage exactly ; there is evidently some con­ <lb/>

            " For which vile earthly duns thy daughter grieve ; <lb/>

            while standing among the foremost combatants, on the belly, <lb/>
            in the middle of the liver, and lie fell prone, and defiled his <lb/>
            tender hairs in the dust. [And falling, he gave a crash, and <lb/>
            his arms resounded upon him.]28 But after him Hole-Creeper <lb/>
            took aim at Mud-Son, and he fixed the sturdy spear in his <lb/>
            breast, and black death seized him as he fell, and the soul flew <lb/>
            from his limbs. But Beet-Man then slew Pot-Stalker, having <lb/>
            smote him to the heart. And Bread-Munch struck Loud- <lb/>
            Talker on the belly, and he fell prone, and the soul fled from <lb/>
            nis limbs. But when Love-Marsh beheld Loud-Talker <lb/>
            perishing, he wounded Hole-Creeper with a mill-stone, corn <lb/>

            darkness shadowed as to his eyes ; [but29 grief possessed Oci­ <lb/>

            sword of him who had made the attack upon himself, nor did <lb/>
            he draw out the sword, but fell immediately before.]30 But <lb/>
            Lick-Man took aim at him with his shining spear. and smote <lb/>
            him (nor did lie miss) in the liver. But when Cabbage-Eater <lb/>
            perceived this, he leaped down the deep banks in flight. But <lb/>
            even thus he escaped not in the waters, for he (Lick-Man) <lb/>
            smote him, and he fell, nor breathed again, and the marsh was <lb/>
            stained with purple gore, and he himself was stretched out <lb/>

            and the brain trickled out from his nostrils, and the earth was <lb/>
            defiled with gore. But faultless Mud-Bed slew Litræus,31 and <lb/>
            Lick-Dish killed faultless Mud-Bed, rushing at him with his <lb/>
            spear, but darkness veiled him as to his eyes. And Munch- <lb/>
            Garlick, perceiving [him], dragged Savour-Hunter by the <lb/>
            foot, and choked him in the marsh, having seized him by the <lb/>
            tendon of his foot. But Crumb-Filcher came to the aid of <lb/>
            his slain companions, and smote Munch-Garlick on the belly, <lb/>
            in the midst of the liver. And he fell before him, and his <lb/>
            soul went to Halles-ward.32 But Mud-Stalker looking on, <lb/>
            hurled a handful of mud against him, and befouled his fore­ <lb/>
            head, and within a little blinded him. And he then was en­ <lb/>
            raged, and taking in his sturdy hand a stone which lay on the <lb/>
            plain, a heavy burthen of the field, with it smote Mud-Stalker <lb/>
            beneath the knees, and the whole of his right shin was broken, <lb/>
            and he fell supine in the dust. But Croak-Son came to his <lb/>
            aid, and went in turn against him, and smote him in the mid­ <lb/>
            dle of the belly; and the sharp bulrush went right through <lb/>
            him, and on the ground were poured out all his entrails, as the <lb/>
            spear was drawn out by the sturdy hand. And Wheat-Eater, <lb/>
            as he perceived it on the banks of the river, limping gave back <lb/>
            from the fight, and was grievously pained. And he leaped <lb/>
            into the ditch, in order that he might escape utter destruction. <lb/>
            But Munch-Bread smote Swell-Cheeks on the tip of the foot, <lb/>
            and pained, he swiftly leaped into the marsh in flight.33 But <lb/>
            when Munch-Bread perceived him fallen in, yet half-alive, <lb/>
            he forthwith raIl up, longing to put an end to him. But <lb/>
            when Garlick saw him fallen in, yet half-alive, he came <lb/>
            through the foremost combatants, and took aim with a sharp <lb/>

            awaited not the valiant heroes, but dived beneath the depths <lb/>
            of the marsh.] 35</p>
          <p>Now36 among the mice there was a certain young one, sur­ <lb/>
            passing the others, a fighter hand to hand, the beloved son of <lb/>
            blameless Bread-Plotter, a general, showing himself a very <lb/>
            Mars, valiant Share-Snatcher, who alone among the mice was <lb/>
            surpassing in the fight. And he stood beside the marsh, ex­ <lb/>
            ulting alone, apart from the rest; and he had determined to <lb/>
            lay waste the race of warrior-frogs. And he would certainly <lb/>
            have accomplished it, since mighty was his strength, had not <lb/>
            the father of men and gods quickly perceived. And the son <lb/>
            of Saturn then took pity on the perishing frogs, and having <lb/>
            moved his head, he uttered such a speech:</p>
          <p>" O gods ! surely 'tis a great deed I behold with mine eyes. <lb/>
            Not a little has Share-Snatcher astounded me, raging to <lb/>
            slaughter the frogs in the marsh.37 But let us with all haste <lb/>
            despatch war-clattering Pallas, and Mars, who may restrain <lb/>
            him from the fight, although being valiant."</p>
          <p>Thus indeed spake the son of Saturn, but Mars replied in <lb/>
            words : " Neither the might of Minerva, nor indeed of Mars, <lb/>
            will be able to avert utter destruction from the frogs. But <lb/>
            come, let us all go as assistants, or let thy mighty weapon, <lb/>
            Titan-slaying, of mighty deeds, be moved, [the weapon] by <lb/>

            and didst chain down Enceladus, and the wild tribe of giants, <lb/>
            [let it be moved, for thus will he be taken, whoever is best.]"</p>
          <p>Thus indeed he spoke, and the son of Saturn hurled his <lb/>
            smouldering bolt. First indeed he thundered, and shook <lb/>

            Gk. Lit. v. § I, and vii. § 3; and for an elegant analysis of its contents, <lb/>
            Coleridge, pp. 284—291. Müller thinks that "a large portion of it has <lb/>
            been lost, which contained the beginning of the narration, the true ground <lb/>
            of the wanderings of Latona." This he conjectured to have been " the <lb/>
            announcement, probably made by Here, that Latona would produce a <lb/>

            as well as the bow, and declares his chief office to be the promulgation of <lb/>
            the counsel of Zeus." See Herm. on vs. 29. Coleridge thinks that two <lb/>

            without much skill to another hymn to the Pythian." The same idea <lb/>

              sit down here, and venerable Latona rejoices, for that she has <lb/>

              streams of Inopiis. For how shall I hymn thee, who art alto­ <lb/>

              every strain of song allotted,5 both through the calf-nurturing <lb/>

              to afford a dwelling to her, a child12 of the earth. But these <lb/>

              winged words:</p>
          <p>" O Delos, if thou art not willing14 to be the dwelling of <lb/>
            my son Phœbus Apollo, and to erect a wealthy temple, nc <lb/>
            other shall ever touch, nor entreat15 thee, nor do I. think that <lb/>
            thou wilt be rich in beeves, nor in sheep, nor wilt thou bear <lb/>
            an harvest, nor produce countless plants. But if thou wilt <lb/>

            king, and the gods shall preserve thee from the hands of <lb/>
            others, since thou hast not a fertile soil.]"</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke, and Delos rejoiced, and answering ad­ <lb/>

            thus I should become greatly honoured. But this thing I <lb/>
            dread, O Latona, nor will I conceal it from thee. For they <lb/>
            say that Apollo will be very haughty, and will lord it greatly <lb/>
            over the immortals, and over mortal men upon the bounteous <lb/>

              a temple and foliaged grove. But in me the polypuses and <lb/>
              black sea-calves will make their unpleasing abodes, through <lb/>
              lack of people. But if, O goddess, thou wouldst endure to <lb/>
              swear unto me a mighty oath, that he will here first erect a <lb/>
              beauteous temple, to be a place of oracles for men, but after­ <lb/>
              wards among all men, since he is of many names.17</p>
          <p>Thus ,-lie spoke ; and Latona swore the mighty oath of the <lb/>
            gods [thus] : "Now may the earth and wide heaven above be <lb/>
            witness to these things, and the down-flowing water of the <lb/>
            Styx, (which is the mightiest and most dreadful oath to the <lb/>
            blessed gods,) truly here shall there always be an incense-altar <lb/>
            and enclosure of Phœbus, and he shall honour thee above all." <lb/>
            But when indeed she had sworn, and had ended the oath, De­ <lb/>
            los rejoiced much at the birth18 of the far-darting king. But <lb/>
            Latona for nine days and nine nights was pierced with unex­ <lb/>

            as many as were best, both Dione, and Rhea, and Iehnæan20 <lb/>
            Themis, and loud-resounding Amphitrite, and the other im­ <lb/>
            mortals save only white-armed Juno; for she sat in the <lb/>
            palace of cloud-compelling Jove, and birth-presiding Hythia <lb/>
            alone21 had not known [of her labour]. For she was sitting <note type="footnote"> 17 Ernesti understands " turn ego utique te libenter, reeeperim," from <lb/>

              beneath the golden clouds on lofty Olympus, through the de­ <lb/>

              envy, because fair-haired Latona was then about to bring <lb/>
              forth a blameless and mighty son. But they sent Iris from the <lb/>
              well-built island, to bring Hithyia, promising [to her as a gift] <lb/>
              a mighty necklace woven with golden threads, nine cubits [in <lb/>
              length]. But they ordered [Iris] to call her apart from <lb/>
              white-armed Juno, lest she should then by words divert her <lb/>
              from going. But when Iris, with feet swift as the wind, heard <lb/>
              this, she set out to run, and swiftly passed through all the <lb/>
              midst. But when she reached the dwelling of the gods, lofty <lb/>
              Olympus, straightway having called Ilithyia out of doors <lb/>
              from the house, she addressed [to her] winged words, in all <lb/>

              joined. And she persuaded her mind within her breast, and <lb/>

            more from his heart.30 It flourished, as when the summit of <lb/>

              But do ye all answer, " [He is] of us, a blind man, and he <lb/>

            For thou first wentest down from Olympus in Pieria, and <lb/>
            didst pass over sandy Lecton,45 and the Magnesians, and <lb/>
            through the Perrhæbians. And quickly didst thou reach <lb/>
            Iolcus, and come to Cenæum in ship-renowned Eubæa. And <lb/>
            thou didst stand upon the Lelantian plain, which pleased not <lb/>

            foliaged wood. But from hence, O far-darting Apollo, hav­ <lb/>

            verdant mountain,46 and quickly earnest from it to Mycalessus <lb/>
            and grassy-couched Teumessus. And thou earnest to the land <lb/>

            ways through the wheat-bearing plain of Thebe, but it was <lb/>
            overgrown with wood.47 But from hence, O far-darting <lb/>

            which pours forth fair-flowing water from Lilæum. Having <lb/>

            thou wentest on to Delphusa,51 where the harmless country <lb/>
            pleased thee, that thou shouldst erect a temple and foliaged <lb/>

            in words:</p>
          <p>" Delphusa, here indeed I design to build a very beautiful <lb/>

            the sea-girt isles, in quest of oracles. But to them all will I <lb/>
            declare unerring counsel, giving responses in my rich temple."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, Phœbus Apollo began to lay down the <lb/>
            foundations, wide, and very long in extent. But Delphusa, <lb/>
            perceiving, was wroth at heart, and spake thus:</p>
          <p>" Phoebus ! far-darting king, what word shall I speak to thy <lb/>
            mind ? since thou designest to build here a very beautiful tem­ <lb/>

            thee, and do thou cast it in thy mind ; the noise of fleet steeds <lb/>
            shall ever harass thee, and the [noise of the] mules coming to <lb/>
            water from my sacred fountains. Here any one of men <lb/>
            will rather wish to behold the well-wrought chariots of men, <lb/>
            and the rattling of swift-footed steeds,52 than a great temple <note type="footnote"> 50 " Currus solutis equis reclinatos relinquunt." Ernesti. If we consider <lb/>

            and do thou, rejoicing in thy mind, receive the fair offerings <lb/>
            of the neighbouring men.</p>
          <p>Thus speaking, she persuaded the mind of the Far-Darter, <lb/>
            that to Delphusa there should be her own renown o'er the <lb/>
            earth, and not that of the Far-Darter. But from hence thou <lb/>
            wentest onward, O far-darting Apollo, and thou earnest into <lb/>
            the city of the insolent Plegyan men, who, caring not for Jove, <lb/>
            dwelt upon the earth in a beauteous dell, near the lake of <lb/>
            Cephissus. From hence thou swiftly earnest rushing53 to the <lb/>
            rock, and thou didst reach Crissa, 54 below snowy Parnassus, <lb/>
            turned at its base towards the west, but above the rock is sus­ <lb/>
            pended aloft, and a rugged, hollow cave runs below. Here <lb/>
            king Phcebus Apollo resolved to construct a pleasant temple, <lb/>
            and thus he spoke: " Here indeed I design to build a very <lb/>
            beautiful temple, to be a shrine of oracles for men, who shall <lb/>
            always bring hither to me perfect hecatombs, ay, as many <lb/>

            But to them all will I declare unerring counsel, giving re­ <lb/>

          <p>Thus having spoken, Phœbus Apollo began to lay down the <lb/>

            Trophonius and Agamedes, the sons of Erginus, dear to the <lb/>

            now apart from me has he given birth to dark-eyed Minerva, <lb/>
            who is conspicuous among all the blessed immortals. But my <lb/>
            son Vulean has been rendered lame amongst all the gods, <lb/>
            being halt as to his feet, whom I myself hurled down, seizing <lb/>
            him with my hands, and cast into the wide sea.57 But him <lb/>
            Thetis, the silver-footed daughter of Nereus, received, and <lb/>
            led to her own sisters. † Would that she might grant another <lb/>
            favour to the blessed galls ! †58 Wretch ! crafty-planner! <lb/>
            what else dost thou now devise ? How daredst thou alone <lb/>
            produce dark-eyed Minerva ? I have not become a mother, <lb/>
            and yet I have been called thy [wife] among the immortals, <lb/>
            who possess the wide heaven. And now, † therefore, will I try <lb/>
            some device, so that a son may be mine,59 who may excel <lb/>
            among the immortal gods, neither dishonouring thy sacred <lb/>

            but being far away from thee, I will be among the immortal <lb/>

          <p>Thus speaking, she went far away from the gods, enraged <lb/>
            as she was,61 and straightway large-eyed venerable Venus <lb/>
            prayed, and with pressed-down hand she smote the earth, <lb/>

            rites. But when now the nights64 and days were accom­ <lb/>

            kept continually rolling here and there in the wood, and gave <lb/>
            up her life, breathing forth gore. But over her Phœbus <lb/>

            the sacred might of the sun caused her [careass] to putrefy <lb/>

            the Pythian king with reason, because there the might of the <lb/>

            Apollo perceived in his mind that the fair-flowing fountain <lb/>
            had deceived him. -And enraged he went to Delphusa, and <lb/>
            quickly reached her, and stood very near her, and addressed <lb/>
            her in words:</p>

            the summit into †the water-streaming rocks,†70 and hid the <lb/>
            streams, and made a temple in the foliaged wood, very near <lb/>

              them. And into the sea he made a spring, in body likened <lb/>
              to a dolphin,73 into the swift ship, and he lay a mighty and <lb/>
              dreadful monster. And no one of them in his mind could <lb/>
              regard or observe74 him, * * * * he moved in all directions, <lb/>

              the hollow black ship, nor did they loose the sail of the black- <lb/>

              of] bull hides, so they sailed, and the light south wind † from <lb/>
              behind pressed on75 the swift ship. † And they first passed <lb/>
              by Malea, and came to the Lacedæmonian land, the sea-girt <lb/>
              city, and Tænarus, the country of the mortal-rejoicing sun, <lb/>
              where the dense-fleeced sheep of the king Sun ever feed, <lb/>
              and possess a pleasant country. They indeed here wished to <lb/>

              their eyes the mighty marvel, whether the monster would re­ <lb/>
              main on the plain [decks] of the hollow ship, or would make <lb/>
              a spring into the fishy wave of the sea around. But the well- <lb/>
              built ship obeyed not the rudders, but keeping rich Pelopon­ <lb/>

              which divides off rich Peloponnesus, there came a mighty <lb/>
              west wind, clear, from the will of Jove, vehement, blowing <lb/>
              briskly from the clear sky, that with all speed the ship might <lb/>
              make its way, running along the briny wave of the sea. And <lb/>

              into western Crissa abounding in vines, into the port; but the <lb/>
              sea-traversing ship drew nigh to the sands. Here the far- <lb/>

              at mid-day, but from it flitted many sparks, and the brilliancy <lb/>
              reached to heaven,78 and he went into his recess through the <lb/>

          <p>" O strangers, who are ye ? Whence do ye sail o'er the <lb/>

          <p>But them far-darting Apollo answering addressed : " Stran­ <lb/>

            mainland, high upon the sands, and by it stretched out the <lb/>
            long props.86 And they made an altar upon the shore of the <lb/>

            They then took repast near the swift dark ship, and made li­ <lb/>
            bations to the blessed gods, who possess Olympus. But when <lb/>
            they had dismissed the desire of drink and food, they set out <lb/>
            to go, and king Apollo, the son of Jove, led the way, having <lb/>
            his lyre in his hands, playing wondrously, taking stately and <lb/>
            lofty steps. But the Cretans, with reverential dread, fol­ <lb/>
            lowed [him] to Pytho, and chanted Io-Prean, like as the <lb/>
            Pæans of the Cretans, and [of them], into whose breasts the <lb/>

            But the beneficial son of Jove, beholding it, laughed, and <lb/>
            straightway spoke thus:</p>

            [son] of Jove, bending himself up, slipped through the key- <lb/>
            hole of the house, like unto an autumnal breeze, like unto a <lb/>
            vapour. And he came straight through the rich temple of the <lb/>
            cave, stepping onwards on tip-toe, for he made no noise, as if <lb/>
            [he were walking] on the earth. And glorious Mercury came <lb/>
            hastily to his cradle, having wrapped his swaddling-clothes <lb/>
            around his shoulders, like an infant child, playing with the <lb/>
            coverlet with his [right] hand on his knees, and holding his <lb/>
            beloved lyre in the left. But god as he was, he escaped not <lb/>
            the notice of his goddess mother, and she spake thus:</p>
          <p>" Why, whence comest thou hither, O cunning plotter, at <lb/>
            this time of night, clad in Impudence ? Now I think that <lb/>
            thou, having fetters round thy sides, from which there is no <lb/>
            escape, wilt shortly pass from the vestibule under the hands <lb/>
            of Apollo, or that thou wilt elude him even while holding thee <lb/>
            in his arms. Away with thee ! a great care hath thy sire be­ <lb/>
            gotten thee to mortal men and immortal gods."</p>
          <p>But her Mercury answered with cunning words: " Mother28 <note type="footnote"> 25 i. e. he was first possessed with the desire of being honoured, as a <lb/>

            Nor among the immortal gods will we endure to remain here <lb/>

            from the deep-flowing ocean. But Apollo came to Onchestus, <lb/>
            going to the pleasant and pure grove of the heavy-roaring <lb/>
            Earth-Shaker, where he found the toothless29 old man forming <lb/>
            the hedge of his vineyard along the wayside, whom first the <lb/>
            son of glorious Latona addressed :</p>
          <p>" O old man, hedge-pruner of grassy Onehestus, I come <lb/>
            hither, seeking heifers from Pieria, all females, all with <lb/>
            crumpled horns, [stolen] from my herd, but the black bull was <lb/>
            pasturing alone, away from the rest, and four savage does <lb/>
            followed in the rear, like men of one mind. They indeed, the <lb/>
            dogs and the bull, were left, (whieh indeed is a great marvel,) <lb/>
            but they [the heifers] have left the soft meadow, just as the <lb/>
            sun was setting, from the sweet pasture. Concerning these <lb/>

          <p>But him the old man, answering in words, addressed: " O <lb/>

            out the whole day till sun-set I have been digging around the <lb/>
            hill of the vineyard; but, O best one, I thought I saw—but <lb/>
            I know not how to distinguish clearly-a boy, which infant <lb/>
            boy was following with fair-horned cows. And he had a <lb/>
            staff, and walked in a wavering manner, and urged them from <lb/>
            behind, and kept their heads opposite to himself."</p>
          <p>The old man spake, and Phœbus Apollo went quicker on <lb/>
            his way. But he saw [the truth like as] a wing-stretching <lb/>
            bird of augury, and forthwith perceived that the thief was the <lb/>
            son of Saturnian Jove. But the son of Jove, Apollo, quickly <lb/>
            entered divine Pylos, seeking the bent-footed heifers, having <lb/>
            concealed his broad shoulders in a purple mist. And the <lb/>
            Far-Darter perceived the footprints, and spake thus:</p>
          <p>" O gods ! surely I behold this a mighty marvel with mine <lb/>
            eyes. These indeed are the footsteps of straight-horned <lb/>
            heifers, but they are turned backwards towards the meadow <lb/>
            of asphodel. And these are the steps neither of man nor <lb/>
            woman, nor of hoary wolves, nor bears, nor lions, nor are <lb/>
            they like [those] of a shaggy-necked centaur, whoever walks <lb/>
            thus terribly with his swift feet, heavily on this side of the <lb/>
            way, and heavier on that side of the way."30</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, king Apollo, the son of Jove, went <lb/>
            on, and came to the wood-clad mountain of Cyllene, into the <lb/>
            heavy-shaded lair of the rock, where also the immortal nymph <lb/>
            brought forth the son of Saturnian Jove. But a pleasant <lb/>
            savour was scattered through the divine mountain, and many <lb/>
            long-footed sheep were browsing on the grass. Here then hast­ <lb/>
            ening, far-darting holy31 Apollo descended the stony ground, <lb/>
            into the murky cave. But when the son of Jove and Maia <lb/>

            feet, because just washed, seeking sweet sleep after hunting, <lb/>
            and he held the new-formed 34 lyre under his shoulder. But the <lb/>
            son of Jove and Latona recognised, nor failed to perceive the <lb/>
            all-beauteous mountain nymph and her dear son, a little boy, <lb/>
            swathed up in crafty tricks. And having looked around every <lb/>
            cranny of the large dwelling, taking a shining key, he opened <lb/>
            three recesses full of nectar and delightful ambrosia. And <lb/>
            much gold and silver lay within, and many purple and white- <lb/>
            woven garments of the nymph, such as the sacred dwellings <lb/>
            of the blessed gods contain within. Here after the son of <lb/>
            Latona had searched out the crannies of the large dwelling, he <lb/>
            addressed glorious Mercury in words :</p>
          <p>" O boy, who reclinest in a cradle, at once tell me where my <lb/>

            mighty marvel among the immortals, that a boy just born <lb/>
            should pass through the vestibule with field-dwelling heifers. <lb/>

            have I perceived any one else the stealer of your cattle, who­ <lb/>

          <p>Thus then he spake, and winking frequently from his eye­ <lb/>
            lids, he rapidly moved with his brows, glancing hither and <lb/>
            thither, whistling to a long distance, as though hearing a vain <lb/>

          <p>‟ O soft young cheat, deviser of tricks, truly I deem that <lb/>

          <p>Thus he spake, but Cyllenian Mercury again leaped up <lb/>
            quickly, going in haste. But with his hands he pulled the <lb/>
            swaddlings, with which he was enwrapped42 as to his <lb/>
            shoulders, around his ears also, and spoke thus:</p>
          <p>" Whether bearest thou me, O Far-Darter, most powerful <lb/>
            of all the gods? Surely thou art thus teasing43 me, enraged <lb/>
            on account of these heifers. O gods ! may the race of cows <lb/>

            whoever these cows are, for I hear the report alone. But <lb/>

          <p>But after vagrant Mercury and the glorious son of Latona <lb/>
            had said these things openly, having their mind in different <lb/>
            ways, for the latter indeed demanded a true confession,46 not <lb/>

            stolen my cows from the meadow, he at even-tide went away, <lb/>

            steps, such as to cause astonishment, and the work of an <lb/>
            illustrious deity. For the dark dust appeared to have the <lb/>
            footprints of the cows turned towards the asphodel meadow <lb/>
            [whence they came]. But this fellow alone, besides [them],49 <lb/>

            eyes with his hands, thinking of wiles. But he himself spoke <lb/>

            price for intelligence."</p>
          <p>Thus then speaking, Phœbus Apollo sat down. But <lb/>
            Mercury, on the other side, making answer, spoke, and di­ <lb/>
            rected [his discourse] to the Saturnian ruler over all the <lb/>
            gods:</p>
          <p>" O father Jove, surely I will tell thee the truth. For I <lb/>
            am unerring, and know not how to lie. [This god] came to <lb/>
            our dwelling, seeking his bent-footed cows, this day, when the <lb/>
            sun had just arisen, nor did he bring any witnesses or beholders <lb/>
            from among the blessed gods, but under much compulsion <lb/>
            bade me give information. And much he threatened me, that <lb/>
            he would hurl me into wide Tartarus, because he, forsooth, pos­ <lb/>
            sesses the flower of glory-loving youth, but I was born [but] <lb/>
            yesterday, (but this he himself also knows,) nor [am] I like <lb/>
            to a strong driver away of cows. Be persuaded (for truly thou <lb/>
            boastest to be my dear father) that I did not drive the cows <lb/>
            home, (so may I be blest!) nor went I across the threshold. <lb/>
            But this I spake truly; I both venerate the sun and the other <lb/>
            gods, and I love thee, and cherish this one; thou also thyself <lb/>
            knowest that I am not guilty. But I add a mighty oath. <lb/>
            No, by these well-adorned vestibules of the gods, [I did not <lb/>
            do it,] and at some time I will repay him for his cruel speech.54 <lb/>
            But do thou aid the younger party."</p>
          <p>Thus spake Argus-slaying Cyllenius, winking, and he held <lb/>
            his swaddling-band on his arm, nor did he cast it away. But <note type="footnote"> 51 So Ernesti. But the cod. Mosc. gives <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυϱ παλάμησεν</foreign>, whence <lb/>

            Jove Laughed greatly, seeing the evil-plotting boy lying well <lb/>
            and skilfully about the heifers. And he ordered them both, <lb/>
            having a concordant mind, to go in scarcli, and messenger <lb/>
            Mercury to lead the way, and to show the place with inno­ <lb/>
            cence of mind, where he had hidden the stout heads of cattle. <lb/>
            And the son of Saturn beckoned [to him] with a nod, and <lb/>
            glorious Mercury obeyed, for the mind of Ægis-bearing Jove <lb/>
            easily persuaded. And these two beauteous children of Jove <lb/>
            hastened to sandy Pylos, to the ford55 of Alpheus, and they <lb/>
            reached the fields and lofty shed, where wealth, forsooth, was <lb/>
            increased during night-time. Here then Mercury, indeed, <lb/>
            going to56 the stone cave, drove the strong heads of cattle <lb/>
            into the light, and the SOIl of Latona looking aside, perceived <lb/>
            the skins of the cows upon a lofty rock, and quickly he asked <lb/>
            glorious Mercury:</p>
          <p>" How wast thou able, O cunning cheat, to cut the throats <lb/>
            of two cows, being thus new-born and infantine ? I myseli <lb/>
            shall hereafter dread 57 thy power. It does not behove thee <lb/>
            to grow very much, O Cyllenian son of Maia.”</p>
          <p>Thus then he spoke, and with his hands he threw around <lb/>
            him strong bands of withy, but they beneath his feet were <lb/>
            forthwith fastened58 upon the earth, although strongly en­ <lb/>
            twined in each other, and [the same thing took place] easily <lb/>
            with all the field-dwelling cows, by the devices of deceitful <lb/>
            Mercury, but Apollo, beholding, marvelled. But then the <lb/>
            strong slayer of Argus kept looking about the place, frequently <lb/>
            darting his eyes, desiring to hide himself. But he very easily <lb/>
            appeased the far-darting son of glorious Latona, ashe himself <lb/>
            wished, although being valiant. But taking [his lyre] in his <lb/>

            he sang with uplifted voice, (for a pleasing voice accompanied <lb/>
            him,) celebrating61 the immortal gads, and the murky earth, <lb/>
            how they were first born, and how each obtained his share by <lb/>
            lot. Mnemosyne indeed, the mother of the Muses, he honoured <lb/>
            first of the goddesses in song, for she had obtained the son of <lb/>
            Maia, and the glorious son of Jove honoured the other immor­ <lb/>
            tal gods according to age, and as each had been born, speak­ <lb/>
            ing all things in order, striking the lyre in his arms. But <lb/>
            insatiable sweetness possessed the mind in his breast, and <lb/>
            having addressed him, he spoke winged words:</p>
          <p>"Cow-slayer, crafty-plotter, labouring62 comrade of the <lb/>

            the immortals, or of mortal man, bestow the glorious gift, and <lb/>
            teach divine song. For I hear this wondrous new voice, <lb/>
            which I say that no one ever learnt, neither of men, nor of <lb/>
            the immortals who possess the Olympian dwellings, save thee, <lb/>

            these three are present at once, so that one may take joy, and <lb/>
            love, and sweet sleep. And truly I am a follower of the <lb/>

            of song are a care, and flourishing song, and the pleasant noise <lb/>

            thou hast learnt thy prerogative67 from the voice of Jove, and <lb/>

            Maia, far-darting Apollo, taking the lyre in his left hand, <lb/>
            tried it with the quill note by note, and it gave a clear sound <lb/>
            beneath his hand,73 and to it the god sang beautifully. Here <lb/>
            they twain indeed turned the cows74 towards the divine <lb/>

            went back towards snowy Olympus, delighted with the lyre, <lb/>
            and counselling Jove rejoiced, and brought both of them to­ <lb/>

            of Latona thoroughly, as [he] now also [loves him],75 as a <lb/>
            pledge then [Mercury] gave the pleasant lyre to the Far- <lb/>

            And he himself in turn contrived a trick of another kind of <lb/>
            skill: he made the far-sounding voice of the syrinx. And <lb/>
            then the SOil of Latona addressed Mercury in words :</p>
          <p>"I fear, O son of Mercury, cunning-plotting messenger, <lb/>

          <p>SING to me, O Muse, the deeds of golden Cyprian Venus, <lb/>
            who both has excited sweet love among the gods, and has <lb/>
            subdued the tribes of mortal men, and the heaven-descended <lb/>
            birds, and all beasts, as many indeed as the mainland, and as <lb/>
            many as the sea2 cherish in great numbers. But to all of <lb/>
            them the occupations of elegantly-crowned Cytherea are a <lb/>
            care. But three minds she is unable to persuade or deceive, <lb/>
            [namely] the daughter of Ægis-bearing Jove, dark-eyed <lb/>
            Minerva; for her the occupations of golden Venus delight <lb/>
            not, but wars and the deeds of Mars please her, and conflicts, <lb/>
            and battles, and to practise renowned deeds. He first taught <lb/>
            mortal3 workmen to make waggons and various chariots in <lb/>
            brass, and she taught soft-fleslied virgins splendid works in <lb/>
            their dwellings, setting them in the mind of each. Nor does <lb/>
            smile-loving Venus overcome in dalliance resounding Artemis <lb/>
            of the golden distaff. For to her the bow is pleasant,4 and to <lb/>
            slay beasts o'er mountains, and lyres, and choirs, and piercing <lb/>
            shouts, and shadowy woods, and a city of just men. Nor in­ <lb/>
            deed do the occupations of Venus please the hallowed virgin, <lb/>
            Vesta, to whom first wily Saturn gave birth, and last again,5 <note type="footnote"> I An elegant paraphrase of this hymn, which Coleridge (p. 299) con­ <lb/>

            Muller, Lit. of Greece, vii. 6, says, .. it is an obvious conjecture that this <lb/>
            hymn (the tone and expression of which has much of the genuine Homer) <lb/>
            was sung in honour of princes of the family of Æneas, in some town of <lb/>
            the range of Ida, where the same line continued to reign even until the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian war." Grote, vol. i. p. 73, rather thinks that it was <lb/>

              by the counsel of Ægis-bearing Jove, hallowed Neptune and <lb/>
              Apollo wooed; but site was altogether unwilling, and velie­ <lb/>
              mently refused. And the divine of goddesses swore a mighty <lb/>
              oath, which indeed was accomplished, touching the head of <lb/>
              her sire, Ægis-bearing Jove, [to the effect] that she would <lb/>
              be a virgin all her days. But to her her father granted a <lb/>
              fair gift instead of marriage, for she sat down in the midst <lb/>
              of the dwelling,6 enjoying the savour. And she possesses <lb/>
              honour in all the temples of the gods, and among all mortal:-, <lb/>
              is the most honoured of the gods. Of these [three] she is <lb/>
              unable to persuade or beguile the minds, but of others there <lb/>
              is nought that can escape Venus, neither among the blessed <lb/>
              gods, nor mortal men. Nay, she even turns aside the mind <lb/>
              of thunder-rejoicing Jove,7 who is both mightiest, and has <lb/>
              been allotted the mightiest honour; and having beguiled his <lb/>
              mind, when site wishes, she easily mingles him with mortal <lb/>
              dames, escaping the notice of his sister-wife, who is much the <lb/>
              most beauteous in form among the immortal goddesses. For <lb/>
              wily Saturn and her mother Rhea brought forth her most <lb/>
              glorious, but Jove, who kens imperishable counsels, made her <lb/>
              his hallowed wife, knowing good things. But into [Venus] <lb/>
              herself Jove cast sweet desire in her mind, that she should <lb/>
              enjoy the embraces of a mortal man, that with all speed she <lb/>
              herself might not be excluded from the mortal couch, and <lb/>
              smile-loving Venus, sweetly smiling, might at some time <lb/>
              boast among all the gods, how that she had mingled the gods <lb/>
              with mortal women, and mortals had borne 8 [children] to im­ <lb/>
              mortals, and how she had mingled the goddesses with mortal <lb/>
              men. And he infused into her mind sweet fondness for <lb/>

              loved, and violently did love seize her in mind, and coming <lb/>
              into Cyprus, she entered her incense-fraught temple at Paphos, <lb/>
              where she has a temple and an incense-fraught altar. Here <lb/>
              she entering, put to the shining doors, and here the Graces10 <lb/>
              washed her, and anointed her with ambrosial oil, such as <lb/>
              blossoms on the gods who are for ever, ambrosial, precious, <lb/>
              which was offered in honour of her. And smile-loving Venus, <lb/>
              when she had put on all her beauteous garments around her <lb/>
              form, being adorned with gold, set out to Troy, quitting <lb/>
              sweet-scented Cyprus, swiftly making her way through the <lb/>
              clouds on high. And she reached many-rifled Ida, the mother <lb/>
              of wild beasts, and went straight through the mountain to the <lb/>
              stall, and after her fawning went the hoary wolves and savage <lb/>
              lions, the bears and swift pards, insatiate after the hinds. But <lb/>
              she was delighted in mind, as she perceived [them], and into <lb/>
              their breasts inspired love.11 And they all in pairs retired to <lb/>
              rest in the shadowy recesses. But she herself came into the <lb/>
              well-built huts, and found the hero Anchises left in the stalls, <lb/>
              apart from the rest, possessing beauty from the gods. But <lb/>
              they all were following the herds through the grassy pastures, <lb/>
              but he, left alone from the rest in the stalls, was pacing to <lb/>
              and fro, clearly striking the lyre. And near before him stood <lb/>
              Venus, the daughter of Jove, like in height and figure12 to <lb/>
              an unwedded virgin, lest he should be terrified on perceiving <lb/>
              her. But Anchises, when he beheld, reflected and marvelled <lb/>
              at her form, and height, and splendid garments. For she had <lb/>
              put on a robe more shining than the flame of fire, and she had <lb/>
              bended circlets and shining pendant drops,13 and there were <lb/>
              most beautiful necklaces around her neck, beautiful, golden, <lb/>
              all-variegated, and around her smooth breast she shone like <lb/>
              the moon, a marvel to behold. But love seized Anchises, and <lb/>
              he addressed her in words:</p>

            to this dwelling, Diana, or Latona,14 or golden Venus, or <lb/>

            dwell on this beautiful mountain,15 and the fountains of rivers <lb/>
            and the grassy valleys. But unto thee I will make an altar <lb/>
            on a lofty rock, in a conspicuous place, and I will offer thee <lb/>
            beautiful victims at all hours. But do thou, having a well­ <lb/>

          <p>But him Venus, the daughter of Jove, then answered: <lb/>
            " Anchises, most glorious of men born upon the earth, I am <lb/>
            no god indeed ; why dost thou equal me with the immortals ? <lb/>
            But [I am] both mortal, and a woman mother gave me birth. <lb/>
            But my father is renowned Atreus, if perchance thou hast <lb/>
            heard his name, who rules over all well-fortified Phrygia, <lb/>
            But I know your language and our own clearly, for a Trojan 17 <lb/>
            nurse cherished me in my home, and she trained up me, a <lb/>
            little girl, having received me from my mother. Thus there­ <lb/>

            golden-wanded slayer of Argus has snatched me away out of <lb/>
            the choir of golden-distaffed, resounding Diana. For we, a <lb/>
            number of nymphs and Alphesibœan virgins, were at play, <lb/>
            and a countless multitude crown-like surrounded us; whence <lb/>
            the golden-wanded slayer of Argus snatched me away. And <lb/>
            he led me to many works of mortal men, and also to much un­ <lb/>

            But I beseech thee by Jove and by thy excellent parents, (for <lb/>

            dressed her : " If indeed thou art mortal, and a mortal mother <lb/>

            mortals never crop with the steel; but when the destiny ot <lb/>
            death is now at hand, the beauteous trees are first dried up <lb/>
            upon the earth, and the bark perishes round them, and the <lb/>

              mountains and the depths of the sea resounded with her in­ <lb/>
              mortal voice, and her revered mother heard her. And quickly <lb/>
              grief seized her mind, and with her hands she rent the veil <lb/>
              above her ambrosial locks, and cast the dark-blue raiment <lb/>
              from both her shoulders, and she rushed, like a bird, o'er dry <lb/>
              and wet,63 seeking her ; but. to her no one either of gods or mor­ <lb/>
              tal men was willing to tell the truth, nor did any one of birds <lb/>
              [of augury] come to her as a true messenger. Then for nine <lb/>
              days did hallowed Ceres perambulate the earth, bearing <lb/>
              blazing torches in her hands, nor ever did she, grieving, taste <lb/>
              ambrosia or sweet-drinking nectar, nor lave her form in the <lb/>
              bath. But when indeed to her the tenth shining morn had <lb/>
              come, Hecate met her, bearing a light in her hands, and bring­ <lb/>
              ing news, spoke to and addressed her.</p>
          <p>" Revered Ceres, bearer of seasons, giver of glorious things, <lb/>
            who of the heavenly gods or mortal men has snatched away <lb/>
            Proserpine, and grieved thy dear mind ? For I heard her <lb/>
            voice, but I perceived not with mine eyes who it was. But <lb/>
            quickly could he tell thee all truly64 * * * * ."</p>
          <p>Thus then spake Hecate, but her the daughter of fair-haired <lb/>
            Rhea answered not in words, but quickly sped forth with her, <lb/>
            bearing lighted torches in her hands. And they went to the <lb/>
            Sun, the surveyor both of men and gods, and they stood in <lb/>
            front of his steeds, and the divine one of goddesses asked <lb/>
            [him] :</p>
          <p>" O Sun, compassionate me on behalf of a goddess, 66 if ever <lb/>
            either by word or deed I have gratified thy heart and mind. <lb/>
            My daughter whom I bore, a sweet blossom, beauteous in <lb/>
            form, whose frequent cries I have heard through the unfruitful <lb/>
            air, as though she were being forced away, but I have not be­ <lb/>
            held her with mine eyes-but do thou (for thou from the <lb/>
            divine asther dost look down with thy rays upon all the earth <lb/>
            and sea) tell me truly, dear son, if thou hast any where seen <lb/>
            him, of the gods or mortal men, who, without my consent, has <lb/>
            seized her perforce, and carried her off."</p>
          <p>Thus she spoke, but her the son of Hyperion answered in <lb/>
            discourse : " Daughter of fair-haired Rhea, queen Ceres, thou <note type="footnote"> 63 i. e. land and sea. Cf. Rittersh. on Oppian. Cyn. i. Il. </note><note type="footnote"> 64 Hermann thinks that the lacuna should probably be filled up thus ; <unclear/> <lb/>

            shalt know ; for I indeed grieve for and pity thee much, sor­ <lb/>
            rowing for thy slender-ancled daughter. But no other of the <lb/>
            immortals is guilty, save only cloud-compelling Jove, who has <lb/>
            given her to his own brother Hades, to be called his blooming <lb/>
            wife. And he, having snatched her away with his steeds, <lb/>
            has led her, loudly shrieking, beneath the murky darkness. <lb/>
            But come, O goddess, cease thy great wrath.66 It in no wise <lb/>
            behoves thee vainly to entertain boundless wrath. Pluto, <lb/>
            who rules over many, is by no means an unseemly kinsman <lb/>
            [to have] among the immortals, thine own brother and of the <lb/>
            same seed. And he has moreover obtained a prerogative, <lb/>
            when division was first made threefold by lot; he dwells <lb/>
            among those of whom he is appointed master by lot."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, he cheered on his steeds, and they, at <lb/>
            his exhortation, swiftly bore along the fleet chariot, like wing­ <lb/>
            expanding birds. But upon her mind a more sad and ruder <lb/>
            grief fell, and then, enraged at the dark-clouded son of Saturn, <lb/>
            going apart from the council of the gods and mighty Olympus, <lb/>
            she went to the cities and rich fields of men, obscuring her <lb/>
            form for a long time. Nor did any one of men or deep-bosomed <lb/>
            women, seeing, recognise her, before that she came to the <lb/>
            dwelling of prudent Celeus, who was at that time the ruler of <lb/>
            sweet-scented Eleusis. And she sat near the way-side, sad­ <lb/>
            dened at heart, by the Parthenian well,67 whence the citizens <lb/>
            drew their water, in the shade, (but above her there was an <lb/>
            olive tree,) like unto an aged old woman, who is shut off both <lb/>
            from child-birth, and from the gifts of crown-loving Venus, <lb/>
            such as are the nurses of the children of law-administering <lb/>
            kings, and housekeepers in their echoing dwellings. But <lb/>
            the daughters of Eleusinian Celeus perceived her as they <lb/>
            were coming for clear-flowing water, that they might bear it <lb/>

            was the eldest of them all. But they knew her not, for difli­ <lb/>

            they addressed [to her] winged words</p>
          <p>" Who, whence art thou, old woman, among ancient-born <lb/>
            men ? And why hast thou walked far away from the city, <lb/>
            nor dost approach the dwellings, where there are women of <lb/>

            younger ones also, who, forsooth, may receive thee kindly in <lb/>

          <p>Thus they spoke, but she, hallowed one of goddesses, an­ <lb/>
            swered in words: "Dear children, whoever ye are 70 of the <lb/>
            sex of women, hail! But I will tell my story to you. It is by <lb/>
            no means unfitting to tell the truth to you who ask. My name <lb/>
            indeed is Dos,71 for this my revered brother gave me. But <lb/>
            now have I come not willingly upon the wide back of the sea, <lb/>
            but pirates by compulsion led me away unwilling. They <lb/>
            then put to at Thoricus in their swift ship, where numerous <lb/>
            women disembarked upon the mainland,72 and they themselves <lb/>
            made ready supper near the halsers of the ship. But my mind <lb/>
            cared not for the pleasant feast, but privily setting out through <lb/>
            the dark mainland, I fled from my overbearing masters, that <lb/>
            they might not enjoy my price, having sold me [purchased] <lb/>
            for nothing.73 Thus have I come hither, wandering, nor <lb/>
            know I aught what land this is, and who are its inhabitants. <lb/>
            But to you may all those who possess the Olympian dwellings <lb/>
            grant blooming husbands, and to bring forth children, as <lb/>
            parents are wont to wish ! But take pity on me, ye damsels, <lb/>
            kindly, dear children, until I reach the dwelling of a man and <lb/>
            woman, that I may willingly work for them in such things <lb/>
            as are the business of an aged woman. And truly I could <lb/>
            nicely nurse a young infant, having him in mine arms, and <lb/>
            could take care of the house, and could spread my master's <lb/>

            her the untouched virgin Callidice, most beauteous in form <lb/>

            power of dignity, and who take the lead among the people, <lb/>
            and by counsels and upright judgments guard the battlements <lb/>
            of the city. There is shrewd-counselling Triptolemus,76 and <lb/>
            Diodes, and Polyxeines, and blameless Eumolpus, and Doli­ <lb/>
            chus, and our noble sire, all whose wives tend their houses ; <lb/>
            not one of whom at first sight despising thy appearance, would <lb/>
            dismiss thee from her dwellings, but they will receive thee, <lb/>
            for truly thou art godlike. But if thou wilt, remain, that we <lb/>
            may go to the abode of our sire, and tell all these matters <lb/>
            thoroughly to our deep-bosomed mother Metaneira, if per­ <lb/>
            chance she will bid thee come to our dwelling and not seek for <lb/>
            the house of another. And a darling son is nurtured by her <lb/>
            in the well-built house, a subject of many prayers, and be­ <lb/>
            loved. If thou couldst train him up, and he should reach the <lb/>
            measure of youth, with reason indeed would any one of the <lb/>
            race of women, seeing, envy thee ; such great rewards for thy <lb/>

            water, bore them rejoicing. And quickly they reached the <lb/>

            curls, like unto the crocus flower, sported. And near the <lb/>
            way they found the renowned goddess, where they had left <lb/>
            her before. But then they led her to the dwelling of their <lb/>
            sire, and she, sorrowing at heart, followed behind them, with <lb/>
            her head veiled, and the dark robe shook loosely around the <lb/>
            tender feet of the goddess. And quickly they reached the <lb/>
            house of Jove-nurtured Celeus, and went through the portico, <lb/>
            where their hallowed mother awaited them by the lintel of the <lb/>
            well-built tenement, having her son, a young off-shoot, at her <lb/>
            bosom. But they ran up to her, and she came to the threshold <lb/>
            on her feet, and truly she reached the top of the dwelling, <lb/>
            and filled the doors with divine light. But admiration, and <lb/>
            wonder, and pallid fear possessed her, and she yielded up her <lb/>
            seat, and bade her be seated. But season-bearing Ceres, of <lb/>
            glorious gifts, was not willing to be seated on the shining seat, <lb/>
            but she remained silent, casting down her beauteous eyes, <lb/>
            until at length Iambe, knowing prudent things, offered her a <lb/>
            compact seat, and above it spread a silver-woven fleece. Here <lb/>
            sitting down, she stretched forth her veil [over her face] with <lb/>
            her hands, and for a long time sat speechless, grieving, in her <lb/>
            seat, nor did she apply herself to any word or deed, but with­ <lb/>
            out a smile, unfed or by food or drink, she sat, wasting away <lb/>
            with longing for her deep-bosomed daughter ; until that <lb/>
            lambe, knowing prudent things, much joking her with ban­ <lb/>
            terings, turned the hallowed, holy [goddess] to smile, and to <lb/>
            laugh, and to have an appeased mind. Here, in after-times also, <lb/>
            she pleased her with orgies. And to her Metaneira gave a <lb/>
            cup of sweet wine, having filled it; but she refused it, " for," <lb/>
            said she, "it was not lawful for her to drink the ruby wine;" <lb/>
            but she bade her, having mixed wheat and water with pounded <lb/>
            pennyroyal, give it her to drink. But she, having made the <lb/>
            mixture, gave it to the goddess, as she commanded, and all­ <lb/>
            hallowed Ceres, having received it, obtained78 the sacred <lb/>
            honour. But to them well-girt Metaneira began discourse :</p>
          <p>" Hail! lady, since I deem that thou art not from mean <lb/>
            parents, but good ones, since modesty and grace are con­ <lb/>
            spicuous in thy countenance, like as [among the descendants] <lb/>
            of law-administering kings. But we men must needs endure <lb/>

            upon our neck. And now, since thou hast come hither, thine <lb/>
            shall be whatever is mine. But cherish for me this boy, <lb/>
            whom born late, and unhoped-for, the immortals have be­ <lb/>
            stowed [on us], and to me he is a subject of many prayers. <lb/>
            If thou wilt train him up, and he reach the measure of youth, <lb/>
            with reason will any one of womankind, seeing, envy thee, <lb/>
            such great gifts will I79 give thee for his nursing." But her <lb/>
            in turn well-crowned Ceres addressed:</p>
          <p>" And thou too, lady, all hail! and may the gods grant thee <lb/>
            good things. But I will willingly receive thy boy, as thou <lb/>
            biddest me, to nurture,80 nor, I trust, will charms harm him, <lb/>
            nor [deadly] plant,81 through the carelessness of his nurse. <lb/>
            For I know a remedy much more efficacious † than wood cut­ <lb/>
            ting, † and I know an excellent antidote for baleful spells."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, she received him in her fragrant <lb/>
            bosom and immortal hands, and his mother rejoiced in mind. <lb/>
            Thus she indeed trained up in the palace Demophoon, the <lb/>
            glorious son of prudent Celeus, whom well-girt Metaneira <lb/>
            bore. But he grew up like unto a god, neither eating food <lb/>
            nor sucking,82 But Ceres anointed him with ambrosia, as <lb/>
            though sprung from a god, breathing sweetly upon him, and <lb/>
            having him in her bosom. But at night she concealed him <lb/>
            in the might of fire, like a brand, without the knowledge of <lb/>
            his dear parents. But to them he was a great marvel, how <lb/>
            bloomingly he sprang up, and was like unto the gods in per­ <lb/>
            son. And truly she would have rendered him free from old <lb/>
            age, and immortal,83 unless well-girt Metaneira, in her folly, <lb/>
            watching by night, had looked out from her perfumed cham­ <lb/>

            her son, and she was greatly disturbed in mind, and bewail­ <lb/>

            But fair-crowned Ceres, enraged with her, put from her to <lb/>
            the ground with her immortal hands the dear son, whom, un <lb/>
            hoped-for, she had brought forth in the palace, having taken <lb/>
            him out of the fire, being very wrathful in mind, and at the <lb/>
            same time she addressed well-girt Metaneira:</p>
          <p>"Ignorant and unwise men, who neither foresee the destiny <lb/>
            of coming good nor evil! And thou, too, by thy folly hast <lb/>
            erred most greatly. For let the pledge of the gods bear wit­ <lb/>
            ness, the water of the Styx that yields no forgiveness, I <lb/>
            would have made thy dear son immortal and free from age <lb/>
            for all days, and would have afforded him unperishing honour. <lb/>
            But now it is not possible for him to escape death and the <lb/>
            Fates; but unperishing honour shall always be his, because <lb/>
            he has sat upon my knees, and slept in mine arms. But when <lb/>
            he is of age, in revolving years, the sons of the Eleusinians <lb/>
            will ever throughout all days stir up 84 battle and grievous <lb/>
            conflict among each other. But I am honoured Ceres, who <lb/>
            is the greatest benefit and joy to immortals and mortals. But <lb/>
            come, let all the people build for me a great temple, and under <lb/>
            it an altar, below the city and the lofty wall, above Cal­ <lb/>
            lichorus, upon the jutting hill. But I myself will teach my <lb/>
            orgies, so that hereafter, performing them holily, ye may ap­ <lb/>
            pease my mind."</p>
          <p>Thus having spoken, the goddess changed her magnitude <lb/>
            and mien, having put off old age, and beauty was breathed <lb/>
            around her, and a pleasant odour was scattered from her <lb/>
            scented robes,85 and far gleamed the light from the immortal <lb/>
            flesh of the goddess, and her yellow curls flourished on her <lb/>
            shoulders, and the close dwelling was filled with the sheen, <lb/>
            as of lightning. And she went out from the palace. But <lb/>
            straightway the knees [of Metaneira] were relaxed, and for <lb/>
            a long time she became speechless, nor did she at all bethink <lb/>
            her of her darling son, to take him up from the ground. But <lb/>
            his sisters heard his piteous voice, and they leaped up from <lb/>
            their well-spread couches. One then, taking up the boy in <note type="footnote"> 54 Hermann reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνξουσ</foreign>', and places a mark of lacuna after this <lb/>

            fire, and another ran with her tender feet to raise up her <lb/>
            mother from the fragrant chamber. And gathering around <lb/>
            him, they washed him, tending him yet panting, but his mind <lb/>
            was not comforted, for inferior nurses and attendants now <lb/>
            possessed him. They indeed, trembling with fear, kept ap­ <lb/>
            peasing the renowned goddess throughout the night, but <lb/>
            together with the dawn appearing they told truly to Celeus <lb/>
            of wide power, how the goddess, fair-crowned Ceres, had <lb/>
            commanded. But he, having summoned the numerous people <lb/>
            into council, ordered them to erect a rich temple to fair-haired <lb/>
            Ceres, and an altar, upon the jutting hill. But they immediately <lb/>
            obeyed, and hearkened to him speaking, and they built, as <lb/>
            he commanded; but he86 kept increasing by the will of the <lb/>
            deity. But when they had finished, and rested from their toil, <lb/>
            they went each one homewards. But yellow-haired Ceres, sit­ <lb/>
            ting down here, far apart from all the blessed gods, remained, <lb/>
            wasting away with longing for her deep-bosomed daughter. <lb/>
            And she rendered that year a most grievous and cruel one for <lb/>
            men upon the many-nurturing earth, nor did the earth give <lb/>
            forth any seed, for well-crowned Ceres concealed it. And <lb/>
            the steers dragged many bent ploughs over the fields to no <lb/>
            purpose, and much white barley fell upon the earth in vain. <lb/>
            And she indeed would have destroyed the whole race of ar­ <lb/>
            ticulate-voiced men by grievous famine, and would have de­ <lb/>
            prived those possessing the Olympian dwellings of the glorious <lb/>
            honour of gifts and sacrifices, had not Jove perceived, and <lb/>
            taken counsel in his mind. And he first sent golden-pinioned <lb/>
            Iris to call fair-haired Ceres, possessing a most lovely appear­ <lb/>
            ance. Thus he spake; but she obeyed dark-clouded Jove, <lb/>
            the son of Saturn, and swiftly ran through the mid way with <lb/>
            her feet. And she reached the city of incense-fraught Eleusis, <lb/>
            and found dark-robed Ceres in the temple, and having ad­ <lb/>
            dressed her, spoke winged words :</p>
          <p>" O Ceres, thy father Jove, knowing imperishable [coun­ <lb/>

            ever But come, nor let my message from Jove be unaccom­ <lb/>
            plished. Thus she spoke; but her mind was not persuaded. <lb/>
            Again then [Jove] sent on all the blessed ever-existing gods. <lb/>
            And they, eoming one after another, called her, and gave <note type="footnote"> 66 The son of Celeus </note> <pb n="421"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="327—361."/> <lb/>
            many beauteous gifts and honours, whatever she wished to <lb/>
            choose among the immortals. But no one was able to per­ <lb/>
            suade her mind and inclination, wrathful in mind; but she <lb/>
            obstinately rejected their discourse. "For never," said slip, <lb/>
            " would she step upon incense-fraught Olympus, nor let forth <lb/>
            the fruit of the earth, before she should behold her fair-faced <lb/>
            daughter with her eyes." But when heavy-thundering, far- <lb/>
            seeing Jove heard this, he sent the golden-wanded slayer of <lb/>
            Argus down into Erebus, in order that, having beguiled <lb/>
            Hades by soft words, he might lead away chaste Proserpine <lb/>
            from the murky darkness to the gods, that her mother, having <lb/>
            beheld her, might cease from her wrath. But Mercury was <lb/>
            not disobedient, but straightway sped briskly beneath the <lb/>
            earth, having left the dwelling of Olympus. And he found <lb/>
            the king within his abode, sitting on a couch with his chaste <lb/>
            spouse, who was grieving much through longing for her <lb/>
            mother; but she, on account of the shameful deeds of the <lb/>
            gods, devised a destructive counsel.87</p>
          <p>Then the bold slayer of Argus, standing near, addressed <lb/>
            him: "Dark-haired Hades, who rulest over the dead, the sire, <lb/>
            Jove, bids thee lead forth noble Proserpine from Erebus to <lb/>
            their88 company, that her mother, having beheld her, may <lb/>
            cease89 from her wrath and bitter anger against the immor­ <lb/>
            tals ; since she devises a dreadful deed, to destroy the weakly <lb/>
            tribes of earth-born men, concealing the seed beneath the <lb/>
            ground, and wasting away the honours of the immortals. But <lb/>
            she cherishes grievous wrath, and does not associate with the <lb/>
            gods, but sits afar off within her incense-fraught temple, pos­ <lb/>
            sessing the rocky city of Eleusis." Thus he spoke, but <lb/>
            Pluto, king of the dead,. smiled from beneath his eyebrows, <lb/>
            and did not disobey the behest of king Jove. And quickly he <lb/>
            bade prudent Proserpine [thus] : " Go, Proserpine, to thy <lb/>

            power with sacrifices, piously performing them, offering <lb/>
            suitable gifts."</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, but prudent Proserpine rejoiced, and quickly <lb/>
            leaped forth through joy. But he had privily given her the <lb/>
            sweet grain of a pomegranate to eat, offering it her in private,92 <lb/>
            that she might not remain all days above with hallowed Ceres, <lb/>
            of dark robes. And Pluto, who rules over many, yoked his <lb/>
            steeds in front beneath the golden chariot, and she mounted <lb/>
            the chariot, and by her the strong slayer of Argus, seizing <lb/>
            the bridles and scourge in his hands, drove [ the steeds] <lb/>
            straight out from the abodes, and they twain flew along not <lb/>
            unwillingly. And swiftly they passed o'er the long tracks, <lb/>
            nor did the sea, nor the water of rivers, nor the grassy valleys, <lb/>
            nor the heights, restrain the rush of the immortal steeds, but <lb/>
            they cut through the deep darkness above them,93 as they <lb/>
            vent. And he stopped driving them, where well-crowned <lb/>
            Ceres stood, before the incense-fraught temple. But she, <lb/>
            perceiving, leaped forward, like a mænad on the shaded <lb/>

            sport, when he nurtured me an infant upon the knees of my <lb/>
            revered mother! [The city] 5 which the people of Phricon <lb/>

            passes-hence setting out, the daughters of Jove, glorious chil­ <lb/>

            But they rejected the divine voice, the song, I say, through <lb/>
            folly. Of whom some one having had experience,7 will, here­ <lb/>
