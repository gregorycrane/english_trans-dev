          <p>By no reader of classical antiquity will any of its remains <lb/>
            be regarded as entirely devoid of worth. The “ fine gold ” <lb/>
            will naturally stand first in estimation, but the “silver and <lb/>
            brass and iron," nay even the “iron mingled with miry <lb/>
            clay,” will each possess its respective value. Accordingly, <lb/>
            while the foremost place will ever be assigned to its His­ <lb/>
            torians, Philosophers, Orators, and Poets, the time will not <lb/>
            be esteemed thrown away which makes him acquainted with <lb/>
            those authors who struck out a new vein of writing, and <lb/>
            abandoning the facts of history and the inventions of my­ <lb/>
            thology, drew upon their own imagination and sought for <lb/>
            subjects in the manners and pursuits of domestic life.</p>
          <p>The publication of a revised translation of Heliodorus <lb/>
            and Longus, and of a new translation of Achilles Tatius, <lb/>
            calls for some brief prefatory observations upon the origin <lb/>
            of fictitious narrative among the Greeks; that department <lb/>
            of literature which, above any other, has been prolific in <lb/>
            finding followers, more especially in modern times; and <lb/>
            which, according to the spirit in which it is handled, is capa­ <lb/>
            ble of producing some of the best or worst effects upon <lb/>
            society.</p>
          <p>Works of fiction may, as we know, administer a poisoned <lb/>
            cup, but they may also supply a wholesome and pleasing <lb/>
            draught; they may be the ministers of the grossest immo­ <lb/>
            rality and absurdity, but they may likewise be the vehicles <lb/>
            of sound sense and profitable instruction.</p>
          <p>“As real History,” says Bacon, " gives us not the sue­ <lb/>
            cess of things according to the deserts of vice and virtuo <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            Fiction connects it, and presents us with the fates and for <lb/>
            tunes of persons, reworded or punished according to merit.'</p>
          <p>" It is chiefly in the fictions of an age," saye Dunlop, <lb/>
            “that we can discover the modes of living, dress, and man­ <lb/>
            tiers of the period ;” and he goes on to say—“ But even if <lb/>
            the utility which is derived from Fiction were less than it <lb/>
            is, how much are we indebted to it for pleasure and enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment ! It sweetens solitude and charms sorrow—it occu­ <lb/>
            pies the attention of the vacant, and unbends the mind of <lb/>
            the philosopher. Like the enchanter, Fiction shows us, as <lb/>
            it were in a mirror, the most agreeable objects; recalls from <lb/>
            a distance the forms which are dear to us, and soothes our <lb/>
            own grief by awakening our sympathy for others. By its <lb/>
            means the recluse is placed in the midst of society ; and he <lb/>
            who is harassed and agitated in the city is transported to <lb/>
            rural tranquillity and repose. The rude are refined by on <lb/>
            introduction, as it were, to the higher orders of mankind, <lb/>
            and even the dissipated and selfish are, in some degree, cor­ <lb/>
            rected by those paintings of virtue and simple nature, which <lb/>
            must ever be employed by the novelist, if he wish to awaken <lb/>
            emotion or delight."</p>
          <p>Huet, Bishop of Avranches, was the first who wrote a <lb/>
            regular and systematic treatise on the origin of fictitious <lb/>
            narrative—“De origine Fabularum Romanensium."</p>
          <p>He gives it as his opinion, that “not in Provence (Pro­ <lb/>
            vincia Romanorum), nor yet in Spain, are we to look for <lb/>
            the fatherland of those amusing compositions called Ro­ <lb/>
            mances ; but that it is among the people of the East, the <lb/>
            Arabs, the Egyptians, the Persians, and the Syrians, that <lb/>
            the germ and origin is to be found, of this species of ficti­ <lb/>
            tious narrative, for which the peculiar genius and poetical <lb/>
            temperament of those nations particularly adapt them, and <lb/>
            in which they delight to a degree scarcely to be credited; <lb/>
            for even their ordinary discourse is interspersed with figu­ <lb/>
            rative expressions, and their maxims of theology and philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, and above all, of morals and political science, are <lb/>
            invariably couched under the guise of allegory or parable." <lb/>
            In confirmation of this opinion he remarks, that nearly <lb/>
            all those who in early times distinguished themselves as <lb/>
            writers of what are now called Romances, were of Oriental <lb/>
            birth or extraction;”—and he instances " Clearchus, a pupil <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            of Aristotle, who was a native of Soli, in Cilicia,—Iam­ <lb/>
            blicus, a Syrian—Heliodorus and Lucian, natives, the one of <lb/>
            Emessa, the other of Samosata—Achilles Tatius, of Alex­ <lb/>
            andria.”</p>
          <p>This statement of Huet's is admitted to hold good, gene­ <lb/>
            rally, by the author of a very interesting Article on the</p>
          <p>“Early Greek Romances,” in No. CCCXXXIII. of Black­ <lb/>
            wood's Magazine; who however differs from the learned <lb/>
            Bishop in some particulars.</p>
          <p>“ While fully admitting," he says, “that it is to the vivid <lb/>
            fancy and picturesque imagination of the Orientals that <lb/>
            we owe the origin of all those popular legends, which <lb/>
            have penetrated under various changes of costume, into <lb/>
            every corner of Europe, we still hold, that the invention <lb/>
            of the Romance of ordinary life, on which the interest of <lb/>
            the story depends upon occurrences in some measure within <lb/>
            the bounds of probability, and in which the heroes and <lb/>
            heroines are neither invested with superhuman qualities, <lb/>
            nor extricated from their difficulties by supernatural means, <lb/>
            must be ascribed to a more European state of society than <lb/>
            that which produced those tales of wonder, which are corn. <lb/>
            monly considered as characteristic of the cHines of the <lb/>
            East."</p>
          <p>This difference of opinion he fortifies, by remarking that <lb/>
            “ the authors enumerated by the Bishop of Avranches <lb/>
            himself were all denizens of Greek cities of Asia Minor, <lb/>
            Syria, and Egypt, and consequently, in all probability, <lb/>
            Greeks by descent; and though the scene of their works is <lb/>
            frequently laid in Asia, the costumes and characters intro­ <lb/>
            duced are almost invariably on the Greek model.”</p>
          <p>lie concludes this part of his subject by saying; " these <lb/>
            writers, therefore, may fairly be considered as constituting a <lb/>
            distinct class from those more strictly Oriental-not only in <lb/>
            birth but in language and ideas; and as being in fact the <lb/>
            legitimate forerunners of modern novelists."</p>
          <p>The first to imbibe a love for fictitious narrative from the <lb/>
            Eastern people among whom they dwelt, were the Mile­ <lb/>
            sians, a colony of Greeks, and from them this species of <lb/>
            narrative derived the name of “ Sermo Milesius." 0 A. <note type="footnote"> * In the opening of his celebrated novel, the “ Golden Ass,” Apuleius <lb/>
            says—“ At ego tibi sermone isto Milesio varias fabulas conseram,” &amp;c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            specimen of the Milesian tale may be seen in the Stories of <lb/>
            Parthenius, which are chiefly of the amatory kind, and not <lb/>
            over remarkable for their moral tendency. From the Greek <lb/>
            inhabitants of Asia Minor, especially from the Milesians, it <lb/>
            was natural that a fondness for Fiction should extend itself <lb/>
            into Greece, and that pleasure should produce imitation. <lb/>
            But it was not until the conquests of Alexander, that a <lb/>
            greater intercourse between Greece and Asia became the <lb/>
            means of conveying the stores of fiction from the one <lb/>
            continent to the other.</p>
          <p>The Romance writers, who flourished previous to Helio­ <lb/>
            dorus, are known only from the summary of their com­ <lb/>
            positions preserved to us by Photius, Patriarch of Constan­ <lb/>
            tinople, in the ninth century. We subjoin their names and <lb/>
            the titles of their works :—</p>
          <p>Antonius Diogenes wrote " I'he incredible things in <lb/>
            Thule;” Iamblicus, the " Babylonica," comprising the for­ <lb/>
            midable number of sixteen books; in addition to which <lb/>
            there is the "Ass" of Lucian, founded chiefly upon the <lb/>
            “ Metamorphoses of Lucius.”</p>
          <p>The palm of merit, in every respect, especially " in the <lb/>
            arrangement of his fable," has been universally assigned to <lb/>
            HELIODORUS, Bishop of Tricca in Thessaly, who flourished <lb/>
            A.D. 400; " whose writing," says Huet, " the subsequent <lb/>
            novelists of those ages constantly proposed to themselves <lb/>
            as a model for imitation ; and as truly may they all be said <lb/>
            to have drunk of the waters of this fountain, as all the <lb/>
            Poets did of the Homeric spring."</p>
          <p>The writers of Romance, posterior to Heliodorus, who <lb/>
            alone are worthy of note, are Achilles Tatius, who is allowed <lb/>
            to come next to hint in merit; Longus, who has given the <lb/>
            first example of the " Pastoral Romance;" and Xenophon, <lb/>
            of Ephesus.</p>
          <p>Having alluded to the various writers of fictitious nar­ <lb/>
            rative, our farther remarks may be confined to Heliodorus, <lb/>
            Longus, and Achilles Tatius. W ith the work of the author of <lb/>
            the “ Ethiopics " are connected some curious circumstances, <lb/>
            which shall be given in the words of an Ecclesiastical His­ <lb/>
            torian, quoted by the writer of the article in Blackwood.</p>
          <p>Nicephorus, 6. xii. c. 34, says—“ This Heliodorus, Bishop <lb/>
            of Tricca, had in his youth written certain love stories, <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            called ‘ Etbiopics,’which are highly popular, even at the <lb/>
            present day, though they are now better known bv the title <lb/>
            of‘ Chariclea;' and it was by reason thereof that lie lost his <lb/>
            see. For inasmuch as many of the youths were drawn into <lb/>
            peril of sin by the perusal of these amorous tales, it was <lb/>
            determined by the Provincial Synod, that either these <lb/>
            books, which kindled the fire of love, should themselves be <lb/>
            consumed by fire, or that the author should be deposed from <lb/>
            his episcopal functions; and this choice being propounded to <lb/>
            him, he preferred resigning his bishoprick to suppressing his <lb/>
            writings.—Heliodorus,” continues the reviewer, "according <lb/>
            to the same authority, was the first Thessalian Bishop who <lb/>
            had insisted on the married clergy putting away their wives, <lb/>
            which may probably have tended to make him unpopular; <lb/>
            but the story of his deposition, it should be observed, rests <lb/>
            solely on the statement of Nicephorus, and is discredited by <lb/>
            Bayle and Huet, who argue that the silence of Socrates, <lb/>
            (Eccles. Hist. B. v. c. 22), in the chapter where he expressly <lb/>
            assigns the authority of the ‘ Ethiopics' to the ‘ Bishop ' <lb/>
            Heliodorus, more than counterbalances the unsupported <lb/>
            assertion of Nicephorus;—‘an author: says Huet, 'of <lb/>
            more credulity than judgment.’ If Heliodorus were, indeed, <lb/>
            as has been generally supposed, the same to whom several <lb/>
            of the Epistles of St. Jerome were addressed, this circum­ <lb/>
            stance would supply an additional argument against the <lb/>
            probability of his having incurred the censures of the <lb/>
            Church; but whatever the testimony of Nicephorus may be <lb/>
            worth on this point, his mention of the work affords un­ <lb/>
            deniable proof of its long continued popularity, as his <lb/>
            Ecclesiastical History was written about A.D. 900, and <lb/>
            Heliodorus lived under the reign of the sons of Theodosius, <lb/>
            fully 500 years earlier."</p>
          <p>Of the popularity of his work in more recent times, the <lb/>
            following instances may be given. "Tasso," says Ghi­ <lb/>
            rardini, " became acquainted with this Romance when it <lb/>
            was introduced at the Court of Charles the IXth of France, <lb/>
            where it was read by the ladies and gentlemen in the trans­ <lb/>
            lation made by Amiot. The poet promised the courtiers <lb/>
            that they should soon see the work attired in the most <lb/>
            splendid vestments of Italian poetry, and kept his promise, <lb/>
            by transferring to the heroine Clorinda (in the tenth <lb/>
             <pb n="x"/>
            canto of the ‘ Gerusalemme ') the circumstances attend­ <lb/>
            ing the birth and early life of the Ethiopian maiden Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea.</p>
          <p>" The proposed sacrifice and subsequent discovery of the <lb/>
            birth of Chariclea have likewise," observes Dunlop, " been <lb/>
            imitated in the Pastor Fido of Guarini, and through it, in <lb/>
            the Astrea of D'Urfé.”</p>
          <p>" Racine had at one time intended writing a drama on <lb/>
            the subject of this Romance, a plan which has been accom­ <lb/>
            plished by Domat, in his Tragedy of Theagenes and Cha­ <lb/>
            .riclea, acted at Paris in the year 1762. It also suggested <lb/>
            the plot of an old English tragicomedy, by an unknown <lb/>
            author, entitled the ‘ Strange Discovery.' "</p>
          <p>Hardy, the French poet, wrote eight tragedies in verse on <lb/>
            the same subject, without materially altering the ground-work <lb/>
            of the Romance; " an instance of literary prodigality"­ <lb/>
            remarks Dunlop truly—“ which is perhaps unexampled.”</p>
          <p>Nor have authors only availed themselves of the work of <lb/>
            Heliodorus. Artists likewise have sought from his pages <lb/>
            subjects for their canvass.</p>
          <p>" Two of the most striking incidents have been finely <lb/>
            delineated by Raphael in separate paintings, in which he <lb/>
            was assisted by Julio Romano. In one he has seized the <lb/>
            moment when Theagenes and Chariclea meet in the temple <lb/>
            of Delphi, and Chariclea presents Theagenes with a torch <lb/>
            to kindle the sacrifice. In the other he has chosen for his <lb/>
            subject, the capture of the Tyrian ship, in which Calasiris <lb/>
            was conducting Theagenes and Chariclea to the coast of <lb/>
            Sicily. The vessel is supposed to have already struck to <lb/>
            the Pirates, and Chariclea is exhibited, by the light of the <lb/>
            moon, in a suppliant posture, imploring Trachinus that she <lb/>
            might not be separated from her lover and Calasiris."</p>
          <p>HELIODORUS, as has already been remarked, is allowed to <lb/>
            be far superior to any of his predecessors in the dis­ <lb/>
            position of the fable;" as also, “ in the artful manner in <lb/>
            which the tale is disclosed;" and Tasso praises him for the <lb/>
            skill which he displays in keeping the mind of his reader in <lb/>
            suspense, and in gradually clearing up what appeared con­ <lb/>
            fused and perplexed. His style is, in many parts, highly <lb/>
            poetical, abounding in expressions and turns of thought <lb/>
            borrowed from the Greek poets, to which, indeed, it is quite <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            Impossible to do justice when translating them into another <lb/>
            language.</p>
          <p>The chief defects in the composition of his work, are the <lb/>
            digressions-for instance, the adventures of Cnemon and <lb/>
            the siege of Cyene ; together with certain critical and phi­ <lb/>
            losophical discussions, which, while they take up consider­ <lb/>
            able space, distract the attention of the reader, without <lb/>
            adding to his interest.</p>
          <p>He has also been blamed for making a third person- <lb/>
            Calasiris—recount the adventures of the hero and heroine; <lb/>
            instead of letting them tell their own story. As regards <lb/>
            the two principal characters, it must be allowed that the <lb/>
            hero, like many heroes in modem novels, is “insipid.” Upon <lb/>
            certain occasions, it is true that Theagenes " comes out <lb/>
            he does battle boldly with the pirate lieutenant; distances <lb/>
            his rival, in good style, in the running match; effectually <lb/>
            cools the courage of the Ethiopian bully; and gives proof <lb/>
            of the skill of reasoning man over the strength of the irra­ <lb/>
            tional brute in the scene of the Taurocathapsia; but with <lb/>
            these exceptions, he is remarkable chiefly for his resistance <lb/>
            to temptations, and for the constancy of his affections—no <lb/>
            slight merits, however, especially in a heathen, and like <lb/>
            other "quiet virtues," of greater intrinsic value than more <lb/>
            sparkling and showy qualities.</p>
          <p>Of Chariclea, on the other hand, it has with justice been <lb/>
            observed,. that " her character makes ample amends for the <lb/>
            defects in that of her lover. The masculine firmness and <lb/>
            presence of mind which she evinces in situations of peril <lb/>
            and difficulty, combined at all times with feminine delicacy; <lb/>
            and the warmth and confiding simplicity of her love for <lb/>
            Theagenes, attach to her a degree of interest which belongs <lb/>
            to none of the other personages."</p>
          <p>" The course of true love never did run smooth," says <lb/>
            the Poet; and however defective may be the work of Helio­ <lb/>
            dorus, in other respects, none of its readers will deny that <lb/>
            the author has exemplified the words of the Bard in the <lb/>
            perils, and escapes, separations, and unexpected reunion ot <lb/>
            the hero and heroine ofthe " Ethiopics." <note type="footnote"> * Author of article in Blackwood. </note> <pb n="xii"/>
            </p>
          <p>None there are, we trust but will rejoice, when at the <lb/>
            conclusion, they find— <lb/>
            “ How Fate to Virtue paid her debt, <lb/>
            And for their troubles, bade them prove <lb/>
            A lengthened life of peace and love." <lb/>
            The forte of Heliodorus lies especially in descriptions; <lb/>
            his work abounds in these, and apart from the general <lb/>
            story, the most interesting portions are, the account of the <lb/>
            haunts of the Buccaneers; the procession at Delphi, with <lb/>
            the respective retinues and dresses of Theagenes and Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea; the wrestling match, and the bull fight—all these <lb/>
            are brought before the reader with picturesque effect, and <lb/>
            in forcible and vivid language; nor should we omit what is <lb/>
            very curious and valuable in an antiquarian point of view, <lb/>
            his minute description of the panoply worn by man and <lb/>
            horse composing the flower of the Persian army, which <lb/>
            paints to the life, the iron-clad heroes of the Crusades, so <lb/>
            , many centuries before they appeared upon the scene.</p>
          <p>With reference to the writers of Greek Romance, in <lb/>
            general, there is one particular point which deserves men­ <lb/>
            tion ; the more prominent manner in which they bring for­ <lb/>
            ward that sex, whose influence is so powerful upon society, <lb/>
            but whose seclusion in those early times banished them <lb/>
            from a participation in the every day affairs of life. <lb/>
            ., The Greek Romances," says Dunlop, " may be considered <lb/>
            as almost the first productions, in which woman is in any <lb/>
            degree represented as assuming her proper station of the <lb/>
            friend and companion of man. Hitherto she had been con­ <lb/>
            sidered almost in the light of a slave, ready to bestow her <lb/>
            affections on whatever master might happen to obtain her; <lb/>
            but in Heliodorus and his followers, we see her an affec­ <lb/>
            tionate guide and adviser. We behold an union of hearts <lb/>
            painted as a mainspring of our conduct in life—we are <lb/>
            delighted with pictures of fidelity, constancy, and chastity."</p>
          <p>The same writer sums up his observations upon the <lb/>
            Greek Romances, by saying: " They are less valuable than <lb/>
            they might have been, from giving too much to adventure, <lb/>
            and too little to manners and character; but these have not <lb/>
            been altogether neglected, and several pleasing pictures are <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            delineated of ancient customs and feelings. In short, these <lb/>
            early fictions are such as might have been expected at the <lb/>
            first effort, and must be considered as not merely valuable <lb/>
            in themselves, but as highly estimable in pointing out the <lb/>
            method of awaking the most pleasing sympathies of our <lb/>
            nature, and affecting most powerfully the fancy and heart. It <lb/>
            The popularity of Heliodorus has found translators for his <lb/>
            Romance in almost every European language—France, <lb/>
            Spain, Italy, Poland, Germany, and Holland have contri­ <lb/>
            buted their versions.</p>
          <p>Four Translations have appeared in English, by Thomas <lb/>
            Underdowne, Lond.,1587; W. Lisle, Lond., 1622; N. Tate <lb/>
            and another hand, 1686 ; lastly, the translation upon which <lb/>
            the present one is based, 1791.</p>
          <p>Among these, Lisle, who favoured the world with a <lb/>
            Poetical version of the Prose Romance, affords us an <lb/>
            example of an adventurous and ill fated wight. <lb/>
            " Carmina qui Rcripsit Musis et Apolline nullo." <lb/>
            “ Apollo and the Nine; their heavy curse <lb/>
            On him did lay;—they bid him—go, write versc.”</p>
          <p>The Reviewer in Blackwood designates his production, as <lb/>
            . “ one of the most precious specimens of balderdash in exist. <lb/>
            ence; a perfect literary curiosity in its way.” Of the <lb/>
            truth of which any one, who will be at the trouble of turning <lb/>
            over his pages, may satisfy himself.</p>
          <p>The worthy man, at starting, prays earnestly for " A sip <lb/>
            of liquor Castaline," and having done this, he mounts and <lb/>
            does his best to get Pegasus into a canter; but it is all in <lb/>
            vain-whip and spurs avail not; the poor jade, spavined <lb/>
            and galled, will not budge an inch; however, nothing daunted, <lb/>
            the rowels and scourge are most unmercifully applied; the <lb/>
            wretched brute gets into a kind of hobbling trot, which <lb/>
            enables the rider to- say at the end of his journey­ <lb/>
            “ This have I wrought with day and nightly swinke <lb/>
            • •• • • • • <lb/>
            That after-comers know, when I an; dead, <lb/>
            I, some good thing in life endeavoured <lb/>
            To keep my name undrown'd in Lethe pool; <lb/>
            In vain (may seem) is wealth or learning lent <lb/>
            To man that leaves thereof no monument."</p><pb n="xiv"/>
            
          <p>The version upon which the present one is founded, is in <lb/>
            many places more of a paraphrase than a translation. <lb/>
            Several passages are entirely omitted, while of others the <lb/>
            sense has been mistaken; it has been the endeavour of the <lb/>
            translator to remedy these defects, and to give the meaning <lb/>
            of his author as literally as is consistent with avoiding stiff­ <lb/>
            ness and ruggedness of style.</p>
          <p>With regard to LONGUS nothing is known of his birth- <lb/>
            place, nor is it certain at what period be flourished; he is <lb/>
            generally supposed however to have lived during the reign <lb/>
            of Theodosiu8 the Great, in the fourth century. Photius <lb/>
            and Suidas, who have preserved the names of various Greek <lb/>
            Romance writers, and have likewise given us summaries of <lb/>
            their works, make no mention of him.</p>
          <p>An extract from the work of Mr. Dunlop, on the " His. <lb/>
            tory of Fiction,” will form a suitable Introduction to this <lb/>
            Pastoral Romance, the first of its kind, and one which is <lb/>
            considered to have had much influence upon the style of <lb/>
            subsequent writers of Romance, in ancient times, as also <lb/>
            among those of the moderns who have chosen for their <lb/>
            theme a Pastoral subject.</p>
          <p>After reviewing the Ethiopics of Heliodorus, Mr. Dunlop <lb/>
            goes on to say:­ <lb/>
            “We now proceed to the analysis of a romance different <lb/>
            in its nature from the works already mentioned; and of a <lb/>
            species which may be distinguished by the appellation of <lb/>
            Pastoral Romance.</p>
          <p>" It may be conjectured with much probability, that <lb/>
            pastoral composition sometimes expressed the devotion, <lb/>
            and sometimes formed the entertainment of the first gene­ <lb/>
            rations of mankind. The sacred writings sufficiently inform <lb/>
            us that it existed among the eastern nations during the­ <lb/>
            earliest ages. Rural images are everywhere scattered, <lb/>
            through the Old Testament; and the Song of Solomon in <lb/>
            particular beautifully delineates the charms of a country <lb/>
            life, while it paints the most amiable affections of the mind, <lb/>
            and the sweetest scenery of nature. A number of passages <lb/>
            of Theocritus bear a striking resemblance to descriptions in <lb/>
            the inspired pastoral; and many critics have believed that he <lb/>
            bad studied its beauties and transferred them to his eclogues. <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            Theocritus was imitated in bis own dialect by Moschus. <lb/>
            and Bion; and Virgil, taking advantage of a different lan­ <lb/>
            guage copied, yet rivalled the Sicilian. The Bucolic! of the <lb/>
            Roman bard seem to have been considered as precluding al. <lb/>
            attempts of the same kind; for, if we except the feeble <lb/>
            efforts of Calpuraius and his contemporary Nemesianus, <lb/>
            who lived in the third century, no subsequent specimen of <lb/>
            pastoral poetry was, as far as I know, produced till the <lb/>
            revival of literature.</p>
          <p>" It was during this interval that Longus, a Greek so­ <lb/>
            phist, who is said to have lived soon after the age of Tatius, <lb/>
            wrote his pastoral romance of Daphnis and Chloc, which is <lb/>
            the earliest, and by far the finest example that has appeared <lb/>
            of this species of composition. Availing himself of the <lb/>
            beauties of the pastoral poets who preceded him, he has <lb/>
            added to their simplicity of style, and charming pictures of <lb/>
            Nature, a story which possesses considerable interest. In <lb/>
            some respects a prose romance is better adapted than the <lb/>
            eclogue or drama to pastoral composition. The eclogue is <lb/>
            confined within narrow limits, and must terminate before <lb/>
            interest can be excited. A series of Bucolics, where two or <lb/>
            more shepherds are introduced contending for the reward <lb/>
            of a crook or a kid, and at most descanting for a short <lb/>
            time on similar topics, resembles a collection of the first <lb/>
            Scenes of a number of comedies, of which the commencement <lb/>
            can only be listened to as unfolding the subsequent action. <lb/>
            The drama is, no doubt, a better form of pastoral writing <lb/>
            than detached eclogues, but at the same time does not well <lb/>
            accord with rustic manners and descriptions.</p>
          <p>" In dramatic composition, the representation of strong <lb/>
            passions is best calculated to produce interest or emotion, <lb/>
            but the feelings of rural existence should be painted as <lb/>
            tranquil and calm. In choosing a prose romance as the <lb/>
            vehicle of pastoral writing, Longus has adopted a form that <lb/>
            may include all the beauties arising from the description of <lb/>
            rustic manners, or the scenery of nature, and which, as far <lb/>
            as the incidents of rural life admit, may interest by an <lb/>
            agreeable fable, and delight by a judicious alternation of nar­ <lb/>
            rative and dialogue. Longus has also avoided many of the <lb/>
            faults into which his modern. imitators have fallen, and <lb/>
            which have brought this style of composition into so much <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            disrepute; his characters never express the conceits of <lb/>
            affected gallantry, nor involve themselves in abstract rea­ <lb/>
            soning ; he has not loaded his romance with those long and <lb/>
            constantly recurring episodes, which fatigue the attention, <lb/>
            and render us indifferent to the principal story. Nor does <lb/>
            be paint that chimerical state of society, termed the golden <lb/>
            age, in which the characteristic traits of rural life are erased, <lb/>
            but attempts to please by a genuine imitation of Nature, <lb/>
            and by descriptions of the manners, the rustic occupations, <lb/>
            or rural enjoyments of the inhabitants of the country where <lb/>
            the scene of the pastoral is laid.</p>
          <p>" The pastoral is in general very beautifully written ;-the <lb/>
            style, though it has been censured on account of the reite­ <lb/>
            ration of the same forms of expression, and as betraying <lb/>
            the sophist in some passages by a play on words, and <lb/>
            affected antithesis, is considered as the purest specimen of <lb/>
            the Greek language produced in that late period; the de­ <lb/>
            scriptions of rural scenery and rural occupations arc ex­ <lb/>
            tremely pleasing, and if I may use the expression, there is <lb/>
            a sort of amenity and calm diffused over the whole romance. <lb/>
            This, indeed, may be considered as the chief excellence in a <lb/>
            pastoral; since we are not so much allured by the feeding <lb/>
            of sheep as by the stillness of the country. In all our <lb/>
            active pursuits, the end proposed is tranquillity, and even <lb/>
            when we lose the hope of happiness, we are attracted by <lb/>
            that of repose; hence we are soothed and delighted with its <lb/>
            representation, and fancy we partake of the pleasure.</p>
          <p>" There can be no doubt that the pastoral of Longus had <lb/>
            a considerable influence on the style and incidents of the <lb/>
            subsequent Greek romances, particularly those of Eusta­ <lb/>
            thius and Theodorus Prodromus; but its effects on modern <lb/>
            pastorals, particularly those which appeared in Italy during <lb/>
            the sixteenth century, is a subject of more difficulty.—Huet <lb/>
            is of opinion, that it was not only the model of the Astrea <lb/>
            of D'Urfé, and the Diana of Montemayor, but gave rise to <lb/>
            the Italian dramatic pastoral. This opinion is combated by <lb/>
            Villoison, on the grounds that the first edition of Longus <lb/>
            was not published till 1598, and that Tasso died in the <lb/>
            year 1595. It is true that the first Greek edition of Longus <lb/>
            was not published till 1598, but there was a French trans­ <lb/>
            ation by Amyot, which appeared in 1650, and one in Latin <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            verse by Gambia in 1569, either of which might have <lb/>
            been seen by Tasso. But although this argument, brought <lb/>
            forward by Villoison, be of little avail, he is probably right <lb/>
            in the general notion he has adopted that Daphne and <lb/>
            Chloe was not the origin of the pastora! drama. The <lb/>
            Sacrificio of Agostino Beccari, which was the earliest <lb/>
            specimen of this style of composition, and was acted at <lb/>
            Ferrara in 1554, was written previous to the appearance of <lb/>
            any edition or version of Longus. Nor is there any simi­ <lb/>
            larity in the story or incidents of the Aminta to those in <lb/>
            Daphnis and Chloe, which should lead us to imagine that the <lb/>
            Greek romance had been imitated by Tasso.</p>
          <p>" It bears, however, a stronger likeness to the more recent <lb/>
            dramatic pastorals of Italy. These are frequently founded <lb/>
            on the exposure of children who, after being brought up as <lb/>
            shepherds by reputed fathers, are discovered by their real <lb/>
            parents by means of tokens fastened to them when they <lb/>
            were abandoned. There is also a considerable resemblance <lb/>
            between the story of Daphnis and Chloe and that of the <lb/>
            Gentle Shepherd: the plot was suggested to Ramsay by <lb/>
            one of his friends, who seems to have taken it from the <lb/>
            Greek pastoral. Marmontel, too, in his Annette and Lubin, <lb/>
            has imitated the simplicity and inexperience of the lovers of <lb/>
            Longus. But of all modern writers the author who has <lb/>
            most closely followed this romance is Gessner. In his Idylls <lb/>
            there is the same poetical prose, the same beautiful rural <lb/>
            descriptions, and the same innocence and simplicity in the <lb/>
            rustic characters. In his pastoral of Daphnis, the scene of <lb/>
            which is laid in Greece, he has painted, like Longus, the <lb/>
            early and innocent attachment of a shepherdess and swain, <lb/>

            arise from rural occupations and the revolutions of the year."</p>
          <p>To these observations we may add, that Longus is sup­ <lb/>
            posed by some to have furnished to Bernardin de St. Pierre <lb/>
            the groundwork for his beautiful tale of Paul and Virginia. <lb/>
            Many points of resemblance may certainly be traced be­ <lb/>
            tween the hero and heroine of the respective works; the <lb/>
            description of their innocence-their simple and rustic <lb/>
            mode of life, and their occupation and diversions. Amoug <lb/>
            the rest may be mentioned the descriptions of the sen­ <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>

            sations of love when first arising in Virgiuis; and the pan­ <lb/>
            tomimic dance in which she and Paul take part.</p>
          <p>An anonymous and " select" translation of Longus, <lb/>
            published at Truro, in 1803, has been taken as the basis of <lb/>
            the present version. The passages (and there are many) <lb/>
            omitted by the former translator are here given, together <lb/>
            with a considerable fragment, first discovered by M. Paul <lb/>
            Louis Courier, in 1810, in the Laurentian Library at Flo­ <lb/>
            rence. It has been the endeavour of the present translator <lb/>
            to make his version convey the sense of the original as <lb/>
            faithful as possible, except in some few passages (" egregio <lb/>
            inspersos corpore nævos") where it has been considered <lb/>
            advisable to employ the veil of a learned language.</p>
          <p>In reading the work of Longus, we must bear in mind <lb/>
            that he was most probably a heathen, or at any rate, that <lb/>
            he describes the heathen state of morals.</p>
          <p>The following passage from Dr. Nott's Preface to his <lb/>
            translation of Catullus will illustrate the principle upon <lb/>
            which the present translator has gone, in presenting in an <lb/>
            English dress passages entirely omitted in the anonymous <lb/>
            version, before referred to :­</p>
          <p>" When an ancient classic is translated and explained, <lb/>
            the work may be considered as forming a link in the chain <lb/>
            of history.- History should not be falsified, we ought <lb/>
            therefore to translate him somewhat fairly, and when he <lb/>
            gives us the manners of his own day, however disgusting to. <lb/>
            our sensations and repugnant to our natures they may <lb/>
            oftentimes prove, we must not, in translation, suppress or <lb/>

            but considered by the best critics to have flourished after <lb/>
            Heliodorus, to whom he is looked upon as next in point of <lb/>
            literary merit, and whom he has more or less imitated in <lb/>
            various parts of his works, like him frequently introducing <lb/>
            into the thread of his narrative the Egyptian buccaneers. <lb/>
            According to Suidas, he became, towards the end of his life, <lb/>
            a Christian and a Bishop; a statement which is however <lb/>
            considered doubtful, as no mention is made by that lexi­ <lb/>
            cographer of his Episcopal see, and Photius, who mentions <lb/>
            him in three different places, is silent upon the subject.</p>
          <p>In point of style, Achilles Tatius is considered to excel <lb/>
            Heliodorus and the other writers of Greek Romance. Pho­ <lb/>
            tius says of him,—" With regard to diction and compo­ <lb/>
            sition, Tatius seems to me to excel when he employs <lb/>
            figurative language: it is clear and natural; his sentences <lb/>
            are precise and limpid, and such as by their sweetness <lb/>
            greatly delight the ear."</p>
          <p>Like Heliodorus, one of his principal excellences lies in <lb/>
            descriptions; and though these, as Mr. Dunlop observes, <lb/>
            Is are too luxuriant, they are in general beautiful, the objects <lb/>
            being at once well selected, and so painted as to form in the <lb/>
            mind of the reader a distinct and lively image. As an <lb/>
            example of his merit in this way, may be mentioned his <lb/>
            description of a garden, and of a tempest followed by a ship­ <lb/>
            wreck; also his accounts of the pictures of Europe, An­ <lb/>
            dromeda, and Prometheus, in which his descriptions and <lb/>
            criticisms are executed with very considerable taste and <lb/>
            feeling." The same writer, however, justly notes the absurd <lb/>
            and aukward manner in which the author, as if to show his <lb/>
            various acquirements, drags in without the slightest neces­ <lb/>
            sity, some of those minute descriptions, viz., those of the <lb/>
            necklace, and of different zoological curiosities, in the Second <lb/>
            Book, together with the invention of purple-dying, and the <lb/>
            accounts drawn from natural history, which are interspersed <lb/>
            in the Fourth Book."</p>
          <p>In his discussions upon the passions of love, and its power <lb/>
            over human nature, however we may object to the warmth <lb/>
            of his description, we cannot but allow the ability with <lb/>
            which,the colours are laid on.</p>
          <p>"The rise and progress of the passion of Clitopho for <lb/>
            Leucippe," observes Mr. Punlop, "is extremely well exe­ <note type="footnote"> b 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            cuted,—of this there is nothing in the romance of Helio­ <lb/>
            dorus. Theagenes and Chariclea, are at first sight violently <lb/>
            and mutually enamoured; in Tatius we have more of the <lb/>
            restless agitation of love and the arts of courtship. Indeec <lb/>
            this is by much the best part of the Clitopho and Leucippe, <lb/>
            as the author discloses very considerable acquaintance with <lb/>
            the human heart. This knowledge also appears in the sen­ <lb/>
            timents scattered through the work, though it must be con­ <lb/>
            fessed, that in many of his remarks he is apt to subtilize <lb/>
            and refine too much."</p>
          <p>In the hero of his work, Achilles Tatius is more unfor­ <lb/>
            tunate even than Heliodorus.—" Clitopho," says a reviewer, <lb/>
            " is a human body, uninformed with a human soul, but <lb/>
            delivered up to all the instincts of nature and the senses. <lb/>
            He neither commands respect by his courage, nor affection <lb/>
            by his constancy." As in the work of HELIODORUS so in <lb/>
            that of Achilles Tatius, it is the heroine who excites our <lb/>
            sympathy and interest:—" Leucippe, patient, high-minded, <lb/>
            resigned and firm, endures adversity with grace; preserving <lb/>
            throughout the helplessness and temptations of captivity, <lb/>
            irreproachable purity and constancy unchangeable."</p>
          <p>In concluding these remarks upon one of the three chief <lb/>
            writers of Greek Romance, one more observation of Mr. <lb/>
            Dunlop will not be out of place.—" Tatius," he says, " has <lb/>
            been much blamed for the immorality of his Romance, and <lb/>
            it must be acknowleged that there are particular passages <lb/>
            which are extremely exceptionable; yet, however odious <lb/>
            some of these may be considered, the general moral tendency <lb/>
            of the story is good ; a remark which may be extended to all <lb/>
            the Greek Romances. Tatius punishes his hero and heroine <lb/>
            for eloping from their father's house, and afterwards rewards <lb/>
            them for their long fidelity."</p>
          <p>Several French translations of Achilles Tatius have <lb/>
            appeared; an Italian one by Coccio; also an English one, <lb/>
            published at Oxford in 1638, which the present writer, after <lb/>
            many inquiries, has been unable to procure a sight of.</p>

          <p>As the thread of the story in the Ethiopics is rather <lb/>
            entangled, through the author's method of telling it, the <lb/>
            following summary from Dunlop's " History of Fiction," <lb/>
            will be useful.</p>
          <p>" The action of the romance is supposed to take place pre­ <lb/>
            vious to the age of Alexander the Great, while Egypt was <lb/>
            tributary to the Persian monarchs. During that period a <lb/>
            queen of Ethiopia, called Persina, having viewed at an <lb/>
            amorous crisis a statue of Andromeda, gives birth to a <lb/>
            daughter of fair complexion. Fearing that her husband <lb/>
            might not think the cause proportioned to the effect, she <lb/>
            commits the infant in charge to Sisimithres, an Ethiopian <lb/>
            senator, and deposits in his hands a ring and some writings, <lb/>
            explaining the circumstances of her birth. The child is <lb/>
            named Chariclea, and remains for seven years with her <lb/>
            reputed father. At the end of this period he becomes <lb/>
            doubtful of her power to preserve her chastity any longer <lb/>
            in her native country; he therefore determines to carry <lb/>
            her along with him, on an embassy to which he had been <lb/>
            appointed, to Oroondates, satrap of Egypt. In that land he <lb/>
            accidentally meets Charicles, priest of Delphi, who was tra- <lb/>
            Telling on account of domestic afflictions, and to him he <lb/>
            transfers the care of Chariclea. Charicles brings her to <lb/>
             <pb n="xxii"/>
            Delphi, and destines her for the wife of his nephew Alca­ <lb/>
            menes. In order to reconcile her mind to this alliance, he <lb/>
            delivers her over to Calasiris, an Egyptian priest, who at <lb/>
            that period resided at Delphi, and undertook to prepossess <lb/>
            her in favour of the young man. About the same time, <lb/>
            Theagenes, a Thessalian, and descendant of Achilles, comes <lb/>
            to Delphi, for the performance of some sacred rite: The­ <lb/>
            ogenes and Chariclea, having seen each other in the temple, <lb/>
            become mutually enamoured.</p>
          <p>" Calasiris, who had been engaged to influence the mind <lb/>
            of Chariclea in favour of her intended husband Alcamenes, is <lb/>
            warned in a vision by Apollo that he should return to his <lb/>
            own country, and take Theagenes and Chariclea along with <lb/>
            birD. Henceforth his whole attention is directed to deceive <lb/>
            Charicles, and effect his escape from Delphi. Having met <lb/>
            with some Phœnician merchants, and having informed the <lb/>
            lovers of bis intentions, he sets sail along with them for <lb/>
            Sicily, to which country the Phœnician vessel was bound ; <lb/>
            but soon after, passing Zacynthus, the ship is attacked by <lb/>
            pirates, who carry Calasiris and those under his protection <lb/>
            to the coast of Egypt.</p>
          <p>" On the banks of the Nile, Trachinus, the captain of the <lb/>
            pirates, prepares a feast to solemnize his nuptials with Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea; but Calasiris, with considerable ingenuity having <lb/>
            . persuaded Pelorus, the second in command, that Chariclea <lb/>
            is enamoured of him, a contest naturally arises between <lb/>
            him and Trachinus during the feast, and the other pirates, <lb/>
            espousing different sides of the quarrel, are all slain except <lb/>
            Pelorus, who is attacked and put to flight by Theagenes. <lb/>
            The stratagem of Calasiris, however, is of little avail, <lb/>
            except to himself: for immediately after the contest, while <lb/>
            Calasiris is sitting on a hill at some distance, Theagenes and <lb/>
            Chariclea are seized by a band of Egyptian robbers, who <lb/>
            conduct them to an establishment formed on an island in a <lb/>
            remote lake. Thyamis, the captain of the banditti, becomes <lb/>
            enamoured of Chariclea, and declares an intention of espous­ <lb/>
            ing her. Chariclea pretends that she is the sister of Thea­ <lb/>
            genes, in order that the jealousy of the robber may not be <lb/>
            excited, and the safety of her lover endangered. Chariclea, <lb/>
            however, is not long compelled to assume this character of <lb/>
            sister. <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiii"/>
            " The colony is speedily destroyed by the forces or the <lb/>
            satrap of Egypt, who was excited to this act of authority <lb/>
            by a complaint from Nausicles, a Greek merchant, that the <lb/>
            banditti had carried off his mistress. Thyamis, the captain <lb/>
            of the robbers, escapes by flight, and Cnemon, a young <lb/>
            Athenian, who bad been detained in the colony, and with <lb/>
            whom Theagenes had formed a friendship during his con­ <lb/>
            finement, sets out in quest of him.</p>
          <p>" Theagenes and Chariclea depart soon after on their way <lb/>
            to a certain village, where they had agreed to meet Cnemon, <lb/>
            but are intercepted on the road by the satrap's forces.</p>
          <p>" Theagenes is sent as a present to the King of Persia; <lb/>
            and Chariclea, being falsely claimed by Nausicles as his mis­ <lb/>
            tress, is conducted to his house. Here Calasiris had acci­ <lb/>
            dentally fixed his abode, since his separation from Thea­ <lb/>
            genes and Chariclea; and was also doing the honours of <lb/>
            the house to Cnemon in the landlord's absence. Chariclea <lb/>
            being recognised by Calasiris, Nausicles abandons the claim <lb/>
            to her which he had advanced, and sets sail with Cnemon <lb/>
            for Greece, while Calasiris and Chariclea proceed in search <lb/>
            of Theagenes. On arriving at Memphis, they find that with <lb/>
            his usual good luck, he had again fallen into the power of <lb/>
            Thyamis, and was besieging that capital along with the robber. <lb/>
            A treaty of peace, however, is speedily concluded. Thy­ <lb/>
            amis is discovered to be the son of Calasiris, and is elected <lb/>
            high-priest of Memphis.</p>
          <p>" Arsace, who commanded in that city, in the absence of <lb/>
            her husband, falls in love with Theagenes; but as he per­ <lb/>
            severes in resisting all her advances, and in maintaining his <lb/>
            fidelity to Chariclea, she orders him to be put to the tor­ <lb/>
            ture : she also commands her nurse, who was the usual <lb/>
            confidant of her amours and instrument of her cruelty, to <lb/>
            poison Chariclea; but the cup-bearer having given the <lb/>
            nurse the goblet intended for Chariclea. she expires in con­ <lb/>
            vulsions. This, however, serves as a pretext to condemn <lb/>
            Chariclea as a poisoner, and the is accordingly appointed to <lb/>
            be burnt. After she had ascended the pile, and the fire had <lb/>
            been lighted, she is saved for that day by the miraculous <lb/>
            effects of the stone Pantarbe, which sibe wore about her <lb/>
            person, and which warded off the flames. During the en­ <lb/>
            suing night a messenger arrives from Oroondates, the <lb/>
            husband of Arsace, who was at the time carrying on a <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiv"/>
            war against the Ethiopians: he had been informed of the <lb/>
            misconduct of his wife, and had despatched one of his <lb/>
            officers to Memphis, with orders to bring Theagenes and <lb/>
            Chariclea to his camp. Arsace hangs herself; but the lovers <lb/>
            are taken prisoners, on their way to Oroondates, by the <lb/>
            scouts of the Ethiopian army, and are conducted to Hy­ <lb/>
            daspes, who was at that time besieging Oroondates in <lb/>
            Syene. This city having been taken, and Oroondates van­ <lb/>
            quished in a great battle, Hydaspes returns to his capital, <lb/>
            Meröe, where, by advice of the Gymnosophists, be proposes <lb/>
            to sacrifice Theagenes and Chariclea to the Sun and Moon, <lb/>
            the deities of Ethiopia.</p>
          <p>" As virgins were alone entitled to the privilege of being <lb/>
            accepted as victims, Chariclea is subjected to a trial of chas­ <lb/>
            tity. Theagenes, while on the very brink of sacrifice, per­ <lb/>
            forms many feats of strength and dexterity. A bull, which <lb/>
            was his companion in misfortune, having broken from tho <lb/>
            altar, Theagenes follows him on horseback and subdues him. <lb/>
            At length, when the two lovers are about to be immo­ <lb/>
            lated, Chariclea, by means of the ring and fillet which had <lb/>
            been attached to her at her birth, and had been carefully <lb/>
            preserved, is discovered to be the daughter of Hydaspes, <lb/>
            which is further confirmed by the testimony of Sisimithres, <lb/>
            once her reputed father; and by the opportune arrival of <lb/>
            Charicles, priest of Delphi, who was wandering through the <lb/>
            world in search of Chariclea. After some demur on the <lb/>
            part of the Gymnosophists, Chariclea obtains her own <lb/>
            release and that of Theagenes, is united to him in marriage, <lb/>
            and acknowledged as heiress of the Ethiopian empire."</p><pb n="xxv"/>

            to her a purple mantle with which the boy was adorned, and <lb/>
            a little sword with an ivory hilt, which was lying by his <lb/>
            side. Lamon having no children of his own, resolves to <lb/>
            bring up the foundling, and bestows on him the pastoral <lb/>
            name of Daphnis.</p>
          <p>" About two years after this occurrence, Dry as, a neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring shepherd, finds in the cave of the Nymphs, a <lb/>
            female infant, nursed by one of his ewes. The child is <lb/>
            brought to the cottage of Dryas, receives the name of Chloe, <lb/>
            and is cherished by the old man as if she had been his <lb/>
            daughter.</p>
          <p>"When Daphnis bad reached the age of fifteen and <lb/>
            Chloo that of twelve, Lamon and Dryas, their reputed <lb/>
            fathers, had corresponding dreams on the same night. The <lb/>
            Nymphs of the cave in which Chloe had been discovered <lb/>
            appear to each of the old shepherds, delivering Daphnis and <lb/>
            Chloe to a winged boy, with a bow and arrows, who com­ <lb/>
            mands that Daphnis should be sent to keep goats, and the <lb/>
            girl to tend the sheep. Daphnis and Chloe have not long <note type="footnote"> * From Dunlop's History of Fiction. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvi"/>
            entered on their new employments, which they exercise <lb/>
            with a care of their flocks increased by a knowledge of the <lb/>
            circumstances of their infancy, when chance brings them to <lb/>
            pasture on the same spot. Daphnis collects the wandering <lb/>
            sheep of Chloe, and Chloe drives from the rocks the goats <lb/>
            of Daphnis. They make reeds in common, and share <lb/>
            together their milk and their wine;—their youth, their <lb/>
            beauty, the season of the year, everything tends to inspire <lb/>
            them with a mutual passion: at length Daphnis having <lb/>
            one day fallen into a covered pit which was dug for a <lb/>
            wolf, and being considerably hurt, receives from Chloe a <lb/>
            kiss, which serves as the first fuel to the flame of love.</p>
          <p>" Chloe had another admirer, Dorco the cowherd, who <lb/>
            having in vain requested her in marriage from Dryas, her <lb/>
            reputed father, resolves to carry her off by force ; for this <lb/>
            purpose he disguises himself as a wolf, and lurks among <lb/>
            some bushes near a place where Chloo used to pasture her <lb/>
            sheep. In this garb he is discovered and attacked by the <lb/>
            dogs, but is preserved from being torn to pieces by the <lb/>
            timely arrival of Daphnis.</p>
          <p>" In the beginning of autumn some Tyrian pirates, having <lb/>
            landed on the island, seize the oxen of Dorco, and carry off <lb/>
            Daphnis whom they meet sauntering on the shore. Chloe <lb/>
            hearing him calling for assistance from the ship, flies for <lb/>
            help to Dorco, and reaches him when he is just expiring of <lb/>
            the wounds inflicted by the corsairs of Tyre. Before his <lb/>
            death he gives her his pipe, on which, after she had closed his <lb/>
            eyes, she plays according to his instructions a certain tune, <lb/>
            which being heard by the oxen in the Tyrian vessel, they <lb/>
            all leap overboard and overset the ship. The pirates being <lb/>
            loaded with heavy armour are drowned, but Daphnis swims <lb/>
            safe to shore.</p>
          <p>" Here ends the first book; and in the second the author- <lb/>
            proceeds to relate, that during autumn Daphnis and Chloe <lb/>
            were engaged in the labours, or rather the delights, of the <lb/>
            vintage. After the grapes had been gathered and pressed, <lb/>
            and the new wine treasured in casks, having returned to <lb/>
            feed their flocks, they are accosted one day by an old man, <lb/>
            named Philetas, who tells them a long story of seeing Cupid <lb/>
            in a garden, adding, that Daphnis and Chloe were to be <lb/>
            dedicated to his service; the lovers naturally enquire who <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvii"/>
            Cupid is, for, although they had felt his influence, they were <lb/>
            ignorant of his name. Philetas describes his power and his <lb/>
            attributes, and points out the remedy for the pain he <lb/>
            inflicts.</p>
          <p>" The progress of their love was on one occasion inter­ <lb/>
            rupted by the arrival of certain youths of Methynmæa, who <lb/>
            landed near that part of the island where Daphnis fed his <lb/>
            flocks, in order to enjoy the pleasures of the chace during <lb/>
            vintage. The twigs by which the ship of these sportsmen <lb/>
            was tied to the shore had been eaten through by some goats, <lb/>
            and the vessel had been carried away by the tide and the <lb/>
            land breeze. Its crew having proceeded up the country in <lb/>
            search of the owner of the animals, and not having found <lb/>
            him, seized Daphnis as a substitute, and lash him severely, <lb/>
            till other shepherds come to his assistance. Philetas <lb/>
            is appointed judge between Daphnis and the Methym­ <lb/>
            næans, but the latter, refusing to abide by his decision, <lb/>
            which was unfavourable to them, are driven from the terri­ <lb/>
            tory. They return, however, next day, and carry off Chloe, <lb/>
            with a great quantity of booty. Having landed at a place <lb/>
            of shelter which lay in the course of their voyage, they pass <lb/>
            the night in festivity, but at dawn of day they are terrified <lb/>
            by the unlooked-for appearance of Pan, who threatens them <lb/>
            with being drowned before they arrive at their intended <lb/>
            place of destination, unless they set Chloe at liberty. <lb/>
            Through this interposition she is allowed to return home, <lb/>
            and is speedily restored to the arms of Daphnis. The <lb/>
            grateful lovers sing hymns to the Nymphs. On the follow­ <lb/>
            ing day they sacrifice to Pan, and hang a goat's skin on a <lb/>
            pine adjoining his image. The feast which follows this <lb/>
            ceremony is attended by all the old shepherds in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood, who recount the adventures of their youth, and <lb/>
            their children dance to the sound of the pipe.</p>
          <p>" The Third Book commences with the approach of winter. <lb/>
            The season of the year precludes the interviews of Daphnis <lb/>
            and Chloe. They could no longer meet in the fields, and <lb/>
            Daphnis was afraid to excite suspicion by visiting the object <lb/>
            of his passion at the cottage of Dryas. lie ventures, how­ <lb/>
            ever, to approach its vicinity, under pretext of laying snares <lb/>
            for birds. Engaged in this employment, he waits a long <lb/>
            time without any person appearing from the house. At <lb/>
             <pb n="xxviii"/>
            length, when about to depart, Dryas himself comes out in <lb/>
            pursuit of a dog, who had run off with the family dinner. <lb/>
            He perceives Daphnis with his game, and accordingly, as a <lb/>
            profitable speculation, invites him into the cottage. The <lb/>
            birds he had caught are prepared for supper, a second cup is <lb/>
            filled, a new fire is kindled, and Daphnis is asked to remain <lb/>
            next day to attend a sacrifice to be performed to Bacchus. <lb/>
            By accepting the invitation, he for some time longer enjoys <lb/>
            the society of Chloe. The lovers part, praying for the revival <lb/>
            of spring; but while the winter lasted, Daphnis frequently <lb/>
            visits the habitation of Dryas. When spring returns, Daph­ <lb/>
            nis and Chloe are the first to lead out their flocks to pasture. <lb/>
            Their ardour when they meet in the fields is increased by long <lb/>
            absence and the season of the year, but their hearts remain <lb/>
            innocent,-a purity which the author still imputes, not to 1 <lb/>
            virtue, but to ignorance.</p>
          <p>" Chromis, an old man in the neighbourhood, had married <lb/>
            a young woman called Lycænium, who falls in love with <lb/>
            Daphnis; she becomes acquainted with the perplexity in <lb/>
            which he is placed with regard to Chloe, and resolves at once <lb/>
            to gratify her own passion and to free him from his embar­ <lb/>
            rassment.</p>
          <p>" Daphnis, however, still hesitates to practise with Chloe <lb/>
            the lesson he had received from Lycænium.</p>
          <p>" In the Fourth Book we are told that, towards the close <lb/>
            of summer, a fellow-servant of Lamon arrives from Myti­ <lb/>
            lene, to announce that the lord of the territory on which the <lb/>
            reputed fathers of Daphnis and Chloe pasture their flocks, <lb/>
            would be with them at the approach of vintage. Lamon <lb/>
            prepares everything for his reception with much assiduity, <lb/>
            but bestows particular attention on the embellishment of a <lb/>
            spacious garden which adjoined his cottage, and of. which the <lb/>
            different parts arc described as having been arranged in a <lb/>
            manner fitted to inspire all the agreeable emotions which the <lb/>
            art of gardening can produce. On this garden Daphnis <lb/>
            had placed his chief hopes of conciliating the good-will of his <lb/>
            master ; and, through his favour, of being united to Chloo. <lb/>
            Lampis, a cowhord, who had asked Chloc in marriago from <lb/>
            Dryas, and had been refused, resolves on the destruction of <lb/>
            this garden. Accordingly, when it is dark, ho tears out the <lb/>
            shrubs by the roots and tramples on the flowers. Dreadful <lb/>
             <pb n="xxix"/>
            is the consternation of Lamon on beholding on the follow. <lb/>
            ing morning the havoc that had been made. Towards even­ <lb/>
            ing his terror is increased by the appearance of Eudromus, <lb/>
            one of his master's servants, who gives notice that he would <lb/>
            be with them in three days. Astylus (the son of Dionv­ <lb/>
            sophanes, proprietor of the territory) arrives first, and <lb/>
            promises to obtain pardon from his father of the mischance <lb/>
            that had happened to the garden. Astylus is accompanied <lb/>
            by a parasite, Gnatho, who is smitten with a friendship a la <lb/>
            Grecque for Daphnis. This having come to the knowledge <lb/>
            of Lamon, who overhears the parasite ask and obtain <lb/>
            Daphnis as a page from Astylus, he conceives it incumbent <lb/>
            on him to reveal to Dionysophanes, who. had by this time <lb/>
            arrived, the mysteries attending the infancy of Daphnis. <lb/>
            He at the same time produces the ornaments he had found <lb/>
            with the child, on which Dionysophanes instantly recognizes <lb/>
            his son. Having married early in youth, he had a daughter <lb/>
            and two sons, but being a prudent man, and satisfied with <lb/>
            this stock, he had exposed his fourth child, Daphuis: a <lb/>
            measure which had become somewhat less expedient, as his <lb/>
            daughter and one of his sons died immediately after, on the <lb/>
            same day, and Astylus alone survived. The change in the <lb/>
            situation of Daphnis does not alter his attachment to Chloe. <lb/>
            He begs her in marriage of his father, who, being informed <lb/>
            of the circumstances of her infancy, invites all the distin­ <lb/>
            guished persons in the neighbourhood to a festival, at which <lb/>
            the articles of dress found along with Cbloe are exhibited. <lb/>
            The success of this device fully answers expectation, Chloe <lb/>
            being acknowledged as his daughter by Megacles, one of the <lb/>
            guests, who was now in a prosperous condition, but had <lb/>
            exposed his child while in difficulties. There being now no <lb/>
            farther obstacle of the union of Daphnis and Chloe, their <lb/>
            marriage is solemnized with rustic pomp, and they lead <lb/>
            through the rest of their days a happy and pastoral life.</p><pb n="xxx"/>

          <p>" CLITOPHO, engaged in marriage to his half-sister Cal­ <lb/>
            ligone, resided at. his father Hippias' house in Tyre, where <lb/>
            his cousin Leucippe came to seek refuge from a war which <lb/>
            was at that time carried on against her native country <lb/>
            Byzantium. These young relatives became mutually ena­ <lb/>
            moured. Callisthenes of Byzantium carries off Calligone <lb/>
            by mistake instead of Leucippe, and Leucippe's mother <lb/>
            having discovered Clitopho one night in the chamber of her <lb/>
            daughter, the lovers resolved to avoid the effects of her <lb/>
            anger by flight.</p>
          <p>" A ccompanied by Clinias, a friend of Clitopho, they <lb/>
            sailed, in the first instance, for Berytus. After a short stay <lb/>
            there, the fugitives set out for Alexandria: the vessel was <lb/>
            wrecked on the third day of the voyage, but Clitopho and <lb/>
            Leucippe, adhering with great presence of mind to the same <lb/>
            plank, were driven on shore near Pelusium, in Egypt. At <lb/>
            this place they hired a vessel to carry them to Alexandria, <lb/>
            but while sailing up the Nile they were seized by a band of <lb/>
            robbers, who infested the banks of the river. The robbers <lb/>
            were soon after attacked by the Egyptian forces, com­ <lb/>
            manded by Charmides, to whom Clitopho escaped during <lb/>
            the beat of the engagement.. Leucippe, however, remained <lb/>
            in the power of the enemy, who, with much solemnity ap­ <lb/>
            parently ripped up our heroine close to the army of Char. <lb/>
            mides, and in the sight of her lover, who was prevented <lb/>
            from interfering by a deep fosse which separated the two <lb/>
            armies.</p>
          <p>" The ditch having been filled up, Clitopho in the course <lb/>
            of the night went to immolate himself on the spot where <note type="footnote"> from Dunlop's History of Fiction. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxi"/>
            Leucippe bad been interred. He arrived at her tomb, but <lb/>
            was prevented from executing his purpose by the sudden <lb/>
            appearance of his servant Satyrus, and of Menelaus, a <lb/>
            young man who had sailed with him in the vessel from <lb/>
            Berytus. These two persons had also escaped from the <lb/>
            shipwreck, and had afterwards fallen into the power of the <lb/>
            robbers. By them Leucippe bad been accommodated with <lb/>
            a false uterus, made of sheep's skin, which gave rise to the <lb/>
            deceptio visus above related.</p>
          <p>"At the command of Menelaus, Leucippe issued from <lb/>
            the tomb, and proceeded with Clitopbo and Menelaus to <lb/>
            the quarters of Charmides. In a short time this com­ <lb/>
            mander became enamoured of Leucippe, as did also Gorgias, <lb/>
            one of his officers. Gorgias gave her a potion calculated to <lb/>
            inspire her with reciprocal passion; but which being too <lb/>
            strong, affected her with a species of madness of a very <lb/>
            indecorous character. She is cured, however, by Chaereas, <lb/>
            another person who had fallen in love with her, and had <lb/>
            discovered the secret of the potion from the servant of <lb/>
            Gorgias.</p>
          <p>" Taking Chaereas along with them, Clitopho and Leu­ <lb/>
            cippe sail for Alexandria. Soon after their arrival, Leucippe <lb/>
            was carried off from the neighbourhood of that place, and <lb/>
            hurried on board a vessel by a troop of banditti employed <lb/>
            by Chaereas. Clitopho pursued the vessel, but when just <lb/>
            coming up with it he saw the head of a person whom he <lb/>
            mistook for Leucippe struck off by the robbers. Disheart­ <lb/>
            ened by this incident, he relinquished the pursuit, and <lb/>
            returned to Alexandria. There he was informed that <lb/>
            Melitta, a rich Ephesian widow, at that time residing at Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, had fallen in love with him. This intelligence he <lb/>
            received from his old friend Clinias, who after the wreck of <lb/>
            the vessel in which be had embarked with Clitopho, had got <lb/>
            on shore by the usual expedient, of a plank, and now <lb/>
            suggested to his friend that he should avail himself of the <lb/>
            predilection of Melitta.</p>
          <p>" In compliance with this suggestion, he set sail with her <lb/>
            for Ephesus, but persisted in postponing the nuptials till <lb/>
            they should reach that place, in spite of the most vehement <lb/>
            importunities on the part of tho widow. On their arrival <lb/>
            at Ephesus the marriage took place ; but before Melitta's <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxii"/>
            object had been accomplished, Clitopho discovered Leucippe <lb/>
            among his wife's slaves; and Thersander, Melitta's husband, <lb/>
            who was supposed to be drowned, arrived at Ephesus. <lb/>
            Clitopho was instantly confined by the enraged husband; <lb/>
            but, on condition of putting the last seal to the now invalid <lb/>
            marriage, be escaped by the intervention of Melitta. He <lb/>
            had not proceeded far when he was overtaken by Ther­ <lb/>
            sander, and brought back to confinement. Thersander, of <lb/>
            course, fell in love with Leucippe, but not being able to <lb/>
            engage her affections, he brought two actions; one declara­ <lb/>
            tory, that Leucippe was his slave, and a prosecution against <lb/>
            Clitopho for marrying his wife. Clitopho escapes being <lb/>
            put to the torture by the opportune arrival of Sostratus, <lb/>
            Leucippe's father, sent on a sacred embassy.</p>
          <p>" Leucippe is at last subjected to a trial of chastity in the <lb/>
            cave of Diana, from which the sweetest music issued when <lb/>
            entered by those who resembled its goddess. Never were <lb/>
            notes heard so melodious as those by which Leucippe was <lb/>
            vindicated. Thersander was, of course, nonsuited, and re­ <lb/>
            tired, loaded with infamy. Leucippe then related to her <lb/>
            father and Clitopho that it was a woman dressed in her <lb/>
            clothes whoso head had been struck off by the banditti, in <lb/>
            order to deter Clitopho from further pursuit, but that a <lb/>
            quarrel having arisen among them on her account, Chaereas <lb/>
            was slain, and after his death she was sold by the other <lb/>

            his determination not to marry her without her own and <lb/>
            her father's consent. The party in a few days sail to By­ <lb/>

            place. Shortly afterwards they proceed to Tyre, and are <lb/>

          <p>THE day had begun to smile cheerily, and the sun was <lb/>
            already gilding the tops of the hills, when a band of men, in <lb/>
            arms and appearance pirates,. having ascended the summit <lb/>
            of a mountain which stretches down towards the Heracleotict <lb/>
            mouth of the Nile, paused and contemplated the sea which <lb/>
            was expanded before them. When not a sail appeared on <lb/>
            the water to give them hopes of a booty, they cast their <lb/>
            eyes upon the neighbouring shore ; where the scene was as <lb/>
            follows : a ship was riding at anchor, abandoned by her <lb/>
            crew; but to all appearance laden with merchandize, as she <lb/>
            drew much water.‡ The beach was strewn with bodies <lb/>
            newly slaughtered; some quite dead, others dying, yet still <lb/>
            breathing, gave signs of a combat recently ended. Yet it <lb/>
            appeared not to have been a designed engagement; but <note type="footnote"> * Piracy was not in those times considered dishonorable; but the <lb/>

              there were mingled with these dreadful spectacles the frag­ <lb/>
              ments of an unlucky feast, which seemed to have concluded <lb/>
              in this fatal manner. There were tables, some yet spread <lb/>
              with eatables; others overturned upon those who had <lb/>
              hoped to hide themselves under them; others grasped by <lb/>
              hands which bad snatched them up as weapons. Cups lay <lb/>
              in disorder, half fallen out of the hands of those who had <lb/>
              been drinking from them, or which bad been flung instead of <lb/>
              missiles; for the suddenness of the affray had converted <lb/>
              goblets into weapons.</p>
          <p>Here lay one wounded with an axe, another bruised by a <lb/>
            shell picked up on the beach, a third had his limbs broken <lb/>
            with a billet, a fourth was burnt with a torch, but the <lb/>
            greater part were transfixed with arrows; in short, the <lb/>
            strangest contrast was exhibited within tho shortest com­ <lb/>
            pass ; wine mingled by fate with blood, war with feast­ <lb/>
            ing, drinking and fighting, libations and slaughters. Such <lb/>
            was the scene that presented itself to the eyes of the <lb/>
            pirates.</p>
          <p>They gazed some time, puzzled and astonished. The van­ <lb/>
            quished lay dead before them, but they nowhere saw the <lb/>
            conquerors; the victory was plain enough, but the spoils <lb/>
            were not taken away; the ship rode quietly at anchor, <lb/>
            though with no one on board, yet unpillaged, as much as if <lb/>
            it had been defended by a numerous crew, and as if all had <lb/>
            been peace. They soon, however, gave up conjecturing, <lb/>
            and began to think of plunder; and constituting themselves <lb/>
            victors, advanced to seize the prey. But as they came near <lb/>
            the ship, and the field of slaughter, a spectacle presented <lb/>
            itself which perplexed them more than any which they had <lb/>
            yet seen. maiden of uncommon and almost heavenly <lb/>
            beauty sat upon a rock; she seemed deeply afflicted at the <lb/>
            scene before her, but amidst that affliction preserved an air <lb/>
            of dignity. Her head was crowned with laurel; site had a <lb/>
            quiver at her shoulder; under her left arm was a bow, tho <lb/>
            other hung negligently down; the rested her left elbow on <lb/>
            her right knee, and leaning her check on her open hand, <lb/>
            looked earnestly down on a. youth who lay upon the ground <lb/>
            at some distance. he, wounded all over, seemed to be <lb/>
            recovering a little from a deep and almost deadly trance; <lb/>
            yet, even in this situation, ho appeared of manly beauty, <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            and the whiteness of his cheeks became more conspicuous <lb/>
            from the blood which flowed upon them.* Pain had de­ <lb/>
            pressed his eye-lids, yet with difficulty he raised them <lb/>
            towards the maiden ; and collecting his spirits, in a languid <lb/>
            voice thus addressed her (while the pirates were still gazing <lb/>
            upon both) : " My love, are you indeed alive ? or, has tho <lb/>
            rage of war involved you also in its miseries ? t But you <lb/>
            cannot bear even in death to be entirely separated from me, <lb/>
            for your spirit still hovers round me and my fortunes."­ <lb/>
            "My fate," replied the maiden, "depends on thee: dost <lb/>
            thou see this (showing him a dagger which lay on her <lb/>
            knee) ? it has yet been idle because thou still breathedst;" <lb/>
            and saying this, she sprang from the rock.</p>
          <p>The pirates upon the mountain, struck with wonder and <lb/>
            admiration, as by a sudden flash of lightning, began to hide <lb/>
            themselves among the bushes; for at her rising she appeared <lb/>
            still greater and more divine, Her " shafts‡ rattled as she <lb/>
            moved;" her gold-embroidered garments glittered in the <lb/>
            turn; and her hair flowed, from under her laurel diadem, in <lb/>
            dishevelled ringlets down her neck.</p>
          <p>The pirates, alarmed and confused, were totally at a loss <lb/>
            to account for this appearance, which puzzled them more <lb/>
            than the previous spectacle; some said it was the goddess <lb/>
            Diana, or Isis, the tutelary deity of the country; others, <lb/>
            that it was some priestess, who, inspired by a divine frenzy <lb/>
            from the gods, had caused the slaughter they beheld; this <lb/>
            they said at random, still in ignorance and doubt. She, flying <lb/>
            towards the youth and embracing him, wept, kissed him, <lb/>
            wiped off the blood, fetched a deep sigh, and seemed as if <lb/>
            she could yet scarcely believe she had blin in her arms.</p>
          <p>The Egyptians, observing this, began to change their <lb/>
            opinion. These, said they, arc not the actions of a deity; <lb/>
            a goddess would not with so much affection kiss a dying <lb/>
            body. They encouraged one another therefore to go nearer, <lb/>
            and to inquire into the real state of things. Collecting <lb/>
            themselves together, then, they ran down and reached tho . <note type="footnote"> * Indum sanguineo veluti violaverat ostro <lb/>

            maiden, as she was busied about the wounds of the youth; <lb/>
            and placing themselves behind her, made a stand, not daring <lb/>
            to say or do any thing. But she, startled at the noise they <lb/>
            made, and the shadow they cast, raised herself up; and just <lb/>
            looking at them, again bent down, not in the least terrified <lb/>
            at their unusual complexion and piratical appearance, but <lb/>
            earnestly applied herself to the care of the wounded youth: <lb/>
            so totally does vehement affection, and sincere love, overlook <lb/>
            or disregard whatever happens from without, be it pleasing <lb/>
            or terrifying; and confines and employs every faculty, both <lb/>
            of soul and body, to the beloved object. But when the <lb/>
            pirates advancing, stood in front, and seemed preparing to <lb/>
            seize her, she raised herself again, and seeing their dark com­ <lb/>
            plexion * and rugged looks,—“If you are the shades of the <lb/>
            slain,” said she, “ why do you trouble me ? Most of you <lb/>
            fell by each other's hands; if any died by mine it was in just <lb/>
            defence of my endangered chastity. But; if you arc living <lb/>
            men, it appears to me that you are pirates ; you come very <lb/>
            opportunely to free mo from my misfortunes, and to finish <lb/>
            my unhappy story by my death." Thus the spake in tragic <lb/>
            strnin.†</p>
          <p>They not understanding what she said, and from the weak <lb/>
            condition of the youth, being under no apprehension of <lb/>
            their escaping, left them as they were; and proceeding to <lb/>
            the ship, began to unload it. It was full of various mer­ <lb/>
            chandize; but they cared for nothing but the gold, silver, <lb/>
            precious stones, and silken garments, of all which articles <lb/>
            they carried away as much as they were able. When they <lb/>
            thought they had enough, (and they found sufficient even to <lb/>
            satisfy the avidity of pirates,) placing their booty on the <lb/>
            shore, they divided it into portions not according to value but <lb/>
            to weight; intending to make what related to the maiden <lb/>
            and the youth, matter of their next consideration. At this <lb/>
            instant another band of plunderers appeared, led by two <lb/>
            men on horseback; which as soon as the first party ob­ <lb/>
            served, they fled precipitately away, leaving their booty <lb/>
            behind them, lest they should be pursued; for they were <lb/>
            but ten, whereas those who came down upon them were at <note type="footnote"> * A full description of the personal appearance of the buccaneers <lb/>

            least twice as many. The maiden in this manner ran a <lb/>
            second risk of being taken captive.</p>
          <p>The pirates hastening to their prey, yet from surprise <lb/>
            and ignorance of the facts stopt a little. They concluded <lb/>
            the slaughter they saw to have been the work of the first <lb/>
            robbers; but seeing the maid in a foreign and magnificent <lb/>
            dress, little affected by the alarming circumstances which <lb/>
            surrounded her, employing her whole attention about the <lb/>
            wounded youth, and seeming to feel his pains as if they <lb/>
            were her own, they were much struck with her beauty and <lb/>
            greatness of mind: they viewed with wonder too the noble <lb/>
            form and stature of the young man, who now began to <lb/>
            recover himself a little, and to assume his usual coun­ <lb/>
            tenance. After some time, the leader of the band advan­ <lb/>
            cing, laid hands upon the maiden, and ordered her to arise <lb/>
            and follow him. She, not understanding his language, yet <lb/>
            guessing at his meaning, drew the youth after her (who still <lb/>
            kept hold of her) ; and pointing to a dagger at her bosom, <lb/>
            made signs that she would stab herself, unless they took <lb/>
            both away together.</p>
          <p>The captain, comprehending what she meant, and pro­ <lb/>
            mising himself a valuable addition to his troop in the youth, <lb/>
            if he should recover, dismounted from his horse, and making <lb/>
            his lieutenant dismount too, put the prisoners upon <lb/>
            their horses, and ordered the rest to follow when they had <lb/>
            collected the booty; he himself walked by their side, ready <lb/>
            to support them, in case they should be in danger of <lb/>
            falling. There was something noble in this; a commander <lb/>
            appearing to serve, and a victor waiting upon his captives; <lb/>
            such is the power of native dignity and beauty, that it <lb/>
            can even impose upon the mind of a pirate, and subdue the <lb/>
            fiercest of men.</p>
          <p>They travelled about two furlongs along the shore; then, <lb/>
            leaving the sea on their right hand, they turned towards <lb/>
            the mountains, and with some difficulty ascending them, <lb/>
            they arrived at a kind of morass, which extended on the <lb/>
            other side. The features of the place were these: the <lb/>
            whole tract is called The Pasturage by the Egyptians; in <lb/>
            it there is a valley, which receives certain overflowings <lb/>
            of the Nile, and forms a lake, the depth of which iu <lb/>
            the centre is unfathomable. On the sides it shoals into <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            a marsh; for, as the shore is to the sea, such are marshes <lb/>
            to lakes.</p>
          <p>Here the Egyptian. pirates have their quarters; one <lb/>
            builds a sort of hut upon a bit of ground which appears <lb/>
            above the water; another spends his life on board a vessel, <lb/>
            which serves him at once for transport and habitation. <lb/>
            II ere their wives work for them and bring forth their <lb/>
            children, who at first are nourished with their mother's <lb/>
            milk, and afterwards with fish dried in the sun ; when they <lb/>
            begin to crawl about they tie a string to their ancles, and <lb/>
            suffer them to go the length of the boat. Thus this <lb/>
            inhabitant of the Pasturage is born upon the lake, is raised <lb/>
            in this manner, and considers this morass as his country, <lb/>
            affording as it does shelter and protection for his piracy. <lb/>
            Men of this description therefore are continually flocking <lb/>
            thither; the water serves them as a citadel, and the quan­ <lb/>
            tity of reeds as a fortification. Having cut oblique channels <lb/>
            among these, with many windings, easy to themselves, but <lb/>
            very difficult for others, they imagined themselves secure <lb/>
            from any sudden invasion; such was the situation of the <lb/>
            lake and its inhabitants.</p>
          <p>Here, about sunset, the pirate-chief and his followers <lb/>
            arrived; they made their prisoners dismount, and disposed <lb/>
            of the booty in their boats. A crowd of others, who had <lb/>
            remained at home, appearing out of the morass, rail to <lb/>
            meet them, and received the chief as if he had been their <lb/>
            king; and seeing the quantity of spoils, and almost divine <lb/>
            beauty of the maiden, imagined that their companions <lb/>
            had been pillaging some temple, and had brought away <lb/>
            the priestess, or perhaps the breathing image † of the deity <note type="footnote"> * For a further description of the buccaneer stronghold, see Achilles <lb/>

            herself. They praised the valour of their captain, and con­ <lb/>
            ducted him to his quarters; these were in a little island at <lb/>
            a distance from the rest, set apart for himself and his few <lb/>
            attendants. When they arrived he dismissed the greater <lb/>
            part, ordering them to assemble there again on the morrow; <lb/>
            and then taking a short repast with the few who remained, <lb/>
            he delivered his captives to a young Greek (whom he bad <lb/>
            not long before taken to serve as an interpreter), assigning <lb/>
            them a part of his own hut for their habitation; giving <lb/>
            strict orders that the wounded youth should have all pos­ <lb/>
            sible care taken of him, and the maiden be treated with the <lb/>
            utmost respect; and then, fatigued with his expedition, and <lb/>
            the weight of cares which lay upon him, he betook himself <lb/>
            to rest.</p>
          <p>Silence now prevailed throughout the morass, and it was <lb/>
            the first watch of night, when the maiden, being freed from <lb/>
            observers, seized this opportunity of bewailing her mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes; inclined to do so the rather, perhaps, by the <lb/>
            stillness and solitude of the night, in which there was <lb/>
            neither sound nor sight to direct her attention, and call off <lb/>
            her mind from ruminating on its sorrows. She lay in a <lb/>
            separate apartment on a little couch on the ground; and <lb/>
            fetching a deep sigh, and shedding a flood of tears, " 0 <lb/>
            Apollo," she cried, " how much more severely dost thou <lb/>
            punish me than I have deserved! Is not what I have <lb/>
            already suffered sufficient ? Deprived of my friends, cap­ <lb/>

            plaints, and interrupted them, saying, “ Cease, my deal <lb/>
            Chariclea; you have reason, I own, to complain, but by so <lb/>
            doing you irritate the deity: he is made propitious by <lb/>
            prayers, more than by expostulations; you must appease <lb/>
            the power above by prayers, not by accusations." " You <lb/>
            are in the right," said she; " but how do you do yourself ?" <lb/>
            -" Better than I was yesterday," he replied, "owing to <lb/>
            the care of this youth, who has been applying medicine to <lb/>
            ray wounds.”—“ You will be still better to-morrow, to said <lb/>
            the youth, “ for I shall then be able to procure an herb <lb/>
            which after three applications will cure them. I know this <lb/>
            by experience; for since I ,,-as brought here a captive, if <lb/>

            Wonder not that I pity your misfortunes; you seem to be <lb/>

            naturally compassionate Grecians."</p>
          <p>“A Greek! 0 gods!" cried out both the strangers in <lb/>
            transport, " a Greek indeed, both in language and appear­ <lb/>
            ance ! Perhaps some relief to our misfortunes is at hand." <lb/>
            "But what," said Thcagenes, "shall we call you?”— <lb/>
            “ Cnemon." “ Of what city ? "—" An Athenian." " What <lb/>
            have been your fortunes?”—“ Cease," he replied; “why <lb/>
            touch upon that subject; my adventures are matter <lb/>
            for a tragedy. You seem to have had sorrows enough of <lb/>
            your own; there is no need to increase them by a recital <lb/>
            of mine; besides, what remains of the night would not be <lb/>
            sufficient for the relation; and the fatigues you have gone <lb/>
            through to-day demand sleep and rest." They would not <lb/>
            admit his excuses, but pressed him to relate his story; <lb/>
            saying, that to hear of misfortunes something like their <lb/>
            own, would be the greatest consolation to them.</p>
          <p>Cnemon then began in this manner:—“My father's <lb/>
            name was Aristippus, an Athenian, a member of the Upper <lb/>
            Council,. and possessed of a decent fortune. After the <lb/>
            death of my mother, as he bad no child but me, he began <lb/>
            to think of a second marriage, esteeming it bard that he <lb/>
            should live an unsettled life solely on my account; he <lb/>
            married therefore a woman of polished manners, but a <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βουλη̃ς δὲ τη̃ς ἄνω</foreign>.The Council of the 500, who were a kind of <lb/>

             <pb n="9"/>
            mischiefmaker, called Demseneta.* From the moment of <lb/>
            her marriage she brought him entirely under her subjection, <lb/>
            enticing him by her beauty and seeming attentions; for <lb/>
            there never was a woman who possessed the arts of allure­ <lb/>
            ment in a greater degree: she would lament at his going <lb/>
            out, run with joy to meet him at his return, blame him for <lb/>
            his stay, and mingle kisses and embraces with the tenderest <lb/>
            expostulations. My father, entangled in these wiles, was <lb/>
            entirely wrapped up in her. At first she pretended to <lb/>
            behave to me as if I had been her own son; this likewise <lb/>
            helped to influence my father. She would sometimes kiss <lb/>
            me, and constantly wished to enjoy my society. I readily <lb/>
            complied, suspecting nothing, but was agreeably surprised <lb/>
            at her behaving to me with so much maternal affection. <lb/>
            When, however, she approached me with more wantonness; <lb/>
            when her kisses became warmer than those of a relation <lb/>
            ought to be, and her glances betrayed marks of passion, I <lb/>
            began to entertain suspicions, to avoid her company, and <lb/>
            repress her caresses. I need not enumerate what artifices <lb/>
            she used, what promises she employed to gain me over, <lb/>
            how she called me darling, sweetest, breath of her life; <lb/>
            how she mingled blandishments with these soft words; <lb/>
            how, in serious affairs, she behaved really as a mother, in <lb/>
            less grave hours but too plainly as a mistress.</p>
          <p>At length, one evening, after I had been assisting at <lb/>
            the solemn Panathenæan festival (when a ship† is sent to <lb/>
            Minerva by land), and bad joined in the hymns and usual <lb/>
            procession, I returned home in my dress of ceremony, with <lb/>
            my robe and crown. She, as soon as she saw me, unable <lb/>
            to contain herself, no longer dissembled her love, but, her <lb/>
            eyes sparkling with desire, ran up to me, embraced me, and <lb/>
            called me her dear Theseus, her young llippolytus: How <lb/>
            do you imagine I then felt, who now blush even at the <lb/>
            recital ? <note type="footnote"> * Cnemon and his stepmother will recall to the reader's memory <lb/>

            in the manner of a sail, and which was put in motion by concealed <lb/>

            from thence to the citadel, where it was put upon Minerva's statue, <lb/>

          <p>“ My father that night was to sup in the Prytanæum,* <lb/>
            and, as it was a grand and stated entertainment, was not <lb/>
            expected to return home till the next day. I had not long <lb/>
            retired to my apartment, when she followed me, and en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to obtain the gratification of her wishes; but <lb/>
            when the saw that I resisted with horror, regardless of her <lb/>
            allurements, her promises, or her threats, fetching a deep­ <lb/>
            drawn sigh, she retired; and the very next day, with un­ <lb/>
            common wickedness, began to put her machinations in <lb/>
            force against me.</p>
          <p>“ She took to her bed; and, when my father returned <lb/>
            and inquired the reason of it, she said she was indisposed, <lb/>
            and at first would say no more. But when he insisted, <lb/>
            with great tenderness, on knowing what had so disordered <lb/>
            her, with seeming reluctance the thus addressed him:— <lb/>
            , This dainty youth, this son of yours, whom I call the gods <lb/>
            to witness I loved as much as you could do yourself, <lb/>
            suspecting me to be with child (which, till I was certain of <lb/>
            it, 1 have yet concealed from you), taking the opportunity <lb/>
            of your absence, while I was advising and exhorting him to <lb/>
            temperance, and to avoid drunkenness and loose women <lb/>
            (for I was not ignorant of his inclinations though I avoided <lb/>
            dropping the least hint of them to you, lest it should <lb/>
            appear the calumny of a step-mother)—while, I say, I took <lb/>
            this opportunity of speaking to him alone, that I might <lb/>
            spare his confusion, I am ashamed to tell how he abused <lb/>
            both you and me; nor did ho confine himself to words; but <lb/>
            assaulting me both with hands and feet, kicked me at last <lb/>
            upon the stomach, and left mo in a dreadful condition, in <lb/>
            which I have continued ever since.'</p>
          <p>" When my father heard this, he made no reply, asked <lb/>
            no questions, framed no excuse for me; but, believing that <lb/>
            she who had appeared so fond of me, would not, without <lb/>
            great reason, accuse me, the next time he met me in the <lb/>
            house he gave me a tremendous blow; and calling his <lb/>
            slaves, he commanded them to scourge me, without so <lb/>
            much as telling me the cause of it. When he had wreaked <lb/>
            his resentment, ‘ Now, at least,' said I, father, tell me the <note type="footnote"> * The public hall at Athens, in which the Prytanes for the time <lb/>
            being, and some other magistrates, had their meals, and entertained <lb/>
            foreign ambassaders. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            reason of this shameful treatment.’ This enraged him the <lb/>
            more. ‘ What hypocrisy!' cried he; ‘ he wants me to repeat <lb/>
            the story of his own wickedness.’ And, turning from me, <lb/>
            he hastened to Demæneta. But this implacable woman, <lb/>
            not yet satisfied, laid another plot against me.</p>
          <p>“ She had a young slave called Thisbe, handsome enough, <lb/>
            and skilled in music. She, by her mistress's orders, put <lb/>
            herself in my way; and though she had before frequently <lb/>
            resisted solicitations, which, I own, I had made to her, she <lb/>
            now made advances herself, in gestures, words, and beha­ <lb/>
            viour. I, like a silly fellow as I was, began to be vain of <lb/>
            my own attractions; and, in short, made an appointment <lb/>
            with her to come to my apartment at night. We continued <lb/>
            our commerce for some time, I always exhorting her to <lb/>
            take the greatest care lest her mistress should detect her. <lb/>
            When, one day, as I was repeating these cautions, she <lb/>
            broke out, ‘ 0 Cnemon! how great is your simplicity, if you <lb/>
            think it dangerous for a slave like me to be discovered with <lb/>
            you. What would you think this very mistress deserves, <lb/>
            who, calling herself of an honourable family, having a lawful <lb/>
            husband, and knowing death to be the punishment of her <lb/>
            crime, yet commits adultery ?—‘ Be silent,' I replied; ‘I <lb/>
            cannot give credit to what you say.’—‘ What if I show you <lb/>
            the adulterer in the very fact?’–‘If you can, do.’–‘ Most <lb/>
            willingly will I,’ says site, ‘ both on your account, who have <lb/>
            been 80 abused by her, and on my own, who am the daily <lb/>
            victim of her jealousy. If you are a man, therefore, seize <lb/>
            her paramour.’—I promised I would, and the then left me.</p>
          <p>“ The third night after this she awakened me from sleep, <lb/>
            and told me that the adulterer was in the house; that my <lb/>
            father, on some sudden occasion, was gone into the country, <lb/>
            and that the lover had taken this opportunity of secretly <lb/>
            visiting Demæneta. Now was the time for me to punish <lb/>
            him as he deserved; and that I should go in, sword in <lb/>
            hand, lest he should escape.</p>
          <p>“I did as Thisbe exhorted me; and taking my sword, she <lb/>
            going before me with a torch, went towards my mother's <lb/>
            bedchamber. When I arrived there, and perceived there <lb/>
            was a light burning within, my passion rising, I burst open <lb/>
            the door, and, rushing in, cried out,‛ Where is the villain, <lb/>
            the vile paramour of this paragon of virtue?' and thus <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            exclaiming, I advanced, prepared to transfix them both, <lb/>
            when my father,0 ye gods! leaping from the bed, fell at <lb/>
            my feet, and besought me, ' 0 myson! stay your hand, <lb/>
            pity your father, and these grey hairs which have nourished <lb/>
            you. I have used you ill, I confess, but not so as to <lb/>
            deserve death from you. Let not passion transport you; <lb/>
            do not imbrue your hands in a parent's blood!’</p>
          <p>" He was going on in this supplicatory strain, while <lb/>
            I stood thunderstruck, without power either to speak or <lb/>
            stir. I looked about for Thisbe, but she had withdrawn. <lb/>
            I cast my eyes in Bronze round the chamber, confounded <lb/>
            and stupified: the sword fell from my hand.</p>
          <p>" Demæneta, running up, immediately took it away; and <lb/>
            my father, now seeing himself out of danger, laid hands <lb/>
            upon me, and ordered me to be bound, his wife, stimulating <lb/>
            him all the time, and exclaiming,‘ This is what I foretold; <lb/>
            I bid you guard yourself from the attempts of this youth; <lb/>
            I observed his looks, and feared his designs.’—‘ You did,' <lb/>
            he replied; ‘but I could not have imagined he would carry <lb/>
            his wickedness to such a pitch.' He then kept me bound; <lb/>
            and though I made several attempts to explain the matter, <lb/>
            he would not suffer me to speak.</p>
          <p>“When the morning was come, he brought me out before <lb/>
            the people, bound as I was; and flinging dust upon his <lb/>
            head, thus addressed them: 'I entertained hopes, 0 Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, when the gods gave me this son, that he would have <lb/>
            been the staff of my declining age. I brought him up gen­ <lb/>
            teelly; I gave him a first-rate education;* I went through <lb/>
            every step needful to procure him the full privileges of a <lb/>
            citizen of Athens; in short, my whole life was a scene of <lb/>
            solicitude on his account. But he, forgetting all this, <lb/>
            abused me first with words, and assaulted my wife with <lb/>
            blows; and at last broke in upon me in the night, bran­ <lb/>
            dishing a drawn sword, and was prevented from committing <lb/>
            a parricide only by a sudden consternation which seized him, <lb/>
            and made the weapon drop from his hand. I have recourse, <lb/>
            therefore, to this assembly for my own defence and his <lb/>
            punishment. I might, I know, lawfully have punished him <note type="footnote"> * Literally, "I had him enrolled iu his proper ward (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φρατρία</foreign>), in <lb/>
            his proper house (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>), and among those arrived at puberty (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔφηβοι</foreign>),” <lb/>

             <pb n="13"/>
            even with death myself; but I had rather leave the whole <lb/>
            matter to your judgment than stain my own hands with his <lb/>
            blood:’ and, having said this, he began to weep.</p>
          <p>“Demæneta too accompanied him with her tears, lamenting <lb/>
            the untimely but just death which I must soon suffer, whom <lb/>
            lily evil genius had armed against my parent; and thus <lb/>
            seeming to confirm by her lamentations the truth of her <lb/>
            husband's accusations.</p>
          <p>" At length I desired to be heard in my turn, when the <lb/>
            clerk arising put this pointed question to me: Did I attack <lb/>
            my father with a sword? W lien I replied,'I did indeed <lb/>
            attack him, but hear how I came so to do’—the whole <lb/>
            assembly exclaimed that, after this confession, there was no <lb/>
            room for apology or defence. Some cried out I ought to <lb/>
            be stoned; others, that I should be delivered to the execu­ <lb/>
            tioner, and thrown headlong into the Barathrum.* During <lb/>
            this tumult, while they were disputing about my punish­ <lb/>
            ment, I cried out, ' All this I suffer on account of my <lb/>
            mother-in-law; my step-mother makes me to be condemned <lb/>
            unheard.' A few of the assembly appeared to take notice <lb/>
            of what I said, and to have some suspicions of the truth of <lb/>
            the case; yet even then I could'not obtain an audience, so <lb/>
            much were all minds possessed by the disturbance.</p>
          <p>" At length they proceeded to ballot: one thousand seven <lb/>
            hundred condemned me to death ; some to be stoned, others <lb/>
            to be thrown into the Barathrum. The remainder, to the <lb/>
            number of about a thousand, having some suspicions of the <lb/>
            machinations of my mother-in-law, adjudged me to per­ <lb/>
            petual banishment; and this sentence prevailed : for though <lb/>
            a greater number had doomed me to death, yet there being <lb/>
            a difference in their opinions as to the kind of death, they <lb/>
            were so divided, that the numbers of neither party amounted <lb/>
            to a thousand.</p>
          <p>" Thus, therefore, was I driven from my father's house <lb/>
            and my country: the wicked Demæneta, however, did not <lb/>
            remain unpunished; in what manner you shall hear by-and­ <lb/>
            by.-But you ought now to take a little sleep; the night is <lb/>
            far advanced, and some rest is necessary for you."</p>
          <p>“ It will be very annoying to us," replied Theagenes, “ if <note type="footnote">* The Barathrum was a yawning cleft behind the Acropolis, into <lb/>
            which criminals were cast. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            you leave this wicked woman unpunished.”—“ Hear, then," <lb/>
            said Cnemon, " since you will have it so.”</p>
          <p>“I went immediately from the assembly to the Piræus, <lb/>
            and finding a ship ready to set sail for Ægina, I embarked <lb/>
            in her, hearing there were some relations of my mother's <lb/>
            there. I was fortunate enough to find them on my arrival, <lb/>
            and passed the first days of my exile agreeably enough <lb/>
            among them. After I had been there about three weeks, <lb/>
            taking my accustomed solitary walk, I came down to tho <lb/>
            port; a vessel was standing in; I stopped to see from <lb/>
            whence she came, and who were on board. The ladder was <lb/>
            no sooner let down, when a person leapt on shore, ran up <lb/>
            to me, and embraced me. He proved to be Charias, one of <lb/>
            my former companions,–‘ O Cnemon!’ he cried out, ‛ I <lb/>
            bring you good news. You are revenged on your enemy: <lb/>
            Demæneta is dead.’–‘ I am heartily glad to see JOlt, <lb/>
            Charias,' I replied; ' but why do you hurry over your good <lb/>
            tidings as if they were bad ones? Tell me how all this has <lb/>
            happened; I fear she has died a natural death, and escaped. <lb/>

            manner upon Cnemon, her dear boy, her soul; insomuch <lb/>
            that the women of her acquaintance, who visited her, won­ <lb/>
            dered at and praised her; that, though a step-dame, she felt; <lb/>
            a mother's affection. They endeavoured to console and <lb/>
            strengthen her; but she replied that her sorrows were past <lb/>
            consolation, and that they were ignorant of the wound <lb/>
            which rankled at her heart.</p>
          <p>" ' When she was alone she abused Thisbe for the share <lb/>
            she had in the business. " How slow were you in assisting <lb/>
            my love! How ready in administering to my revenge! <lb/>
            You deprived me of him I loved above all the world, with­ <lb/>
            out giving me an instant to repent and be appeased." And <lb/>
            she gave plain hints that she intended some mischief <lb/>
            against her.</p>
          <p>“ ‘ Thisbe seeing her disappointed, enraged, almost out of <lb/>
            her senses with love and grief, and capable of undertaking <lb/>
            anything, determined to be beforehand with her; and. by <lb/>
            laying a snare for her mistress, to provide for her own <lb/>
            security. One day, therefore, she thus accosted her: <lb/>
            it Why, 0 my mistress, do you wrongfully accuse your <lb/>
            slave ? It has always been my study to obey your will in <lb/>
            the best manner I could; if anything unlucky has hap­ <lb/>
            pened, fortune is to blame; I am ready now, if you cOin. <lb/>
            mand me, to endeavour to find a remedy for your distress."</p>
          <p>–“ What remedy can you find ?" cried she. " He who alone <lb/>
            could ease my torments is far distant; the unexpected lenity <lb/>
            of his judges has been my ruin: had he been stoned or <lb/>
            otherwise put to death, my hopes and cares would have been <lb/>
            buried with him. Impossibility of gratification extinguishes <lb/>
            desire, and despair makes the heart, callous. But now I <lb/>
            seem to have him before my eyes: I hear, and blush at <lb/>
            hearing him upbraid me with his injuries. Sometimes I <lb/>
            flatter my fond heart that he will return again, and that I <lb/>
            shall obtain my wishes; at other times I form schemes of <lb/>
            seeking him myself, on whatever shore he wanders. These <lb/>
            thoughts agitate, inflame, and drive me beside myself. Ye' <lb/>
            gods! I am justly served. Why, instead of laying schemes <lb/>
            against his life, did I not persist in endeavouring to subdue <lb/>
            him by kindness ? He refused me at first, and it was but <lb/>
            fitting he should do so; I was a stranger, and he reverenced <lb/>
            his father's bed. Time and persuasion might have overcome <lb/>
            his coldness; but I, unjust, and inhuman as I was, more <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            like a tyrant than his mistress, cruelly punished his first dis­ <lb/>
            obedience. Yet with how much justice might he slight <lb/>
            Demæneta, whom he so infinitely surpassed in beauty! But, <lb/>
            my dear Thisbo, what remedy is it you hint at ?” The art­ <lb/>
            ful slave replied: “ 0 Mistress, Cnemon, as most people <lb/>
            think, in obedience to the sentence, has departed both from <lb/>
            the city and from Attica; but I, who inquire anxiously <lb/>
            into everything that you can have any concern in, have dis­ <lb/>
            covered that he is lurking somewhere about the town. You <lb/>
            have heard perhaps of Arsinoë the singer: he has long been <lb/>
            connected with her. After his misfortune, she promised to <lb/>
            go into exile with him, and keeps him concealed at her house <lb/>
            till she can prepare herself for setting out.”–“Happy <lb/>
            Arsinoë” cried Demæneta; " happy at first in possessing <lb/>
            the love of Cnemon, and now in being permitted to accom­ <lb/>
            pany him into banishment. But what is all this to me ?" <lb/>
            —“ Attend, and you shall hear,” saidThisbe. " I will pre­ <lb/>
            tend that I am in love with Cnemon. I will beg Arsinoë, <lb/>
            with whom I am acquainted, to introduce me some night to <lb/>
            him in her room ; you may, if you please, represent Arsinoë, <lb/>
            and receive his visit instead of me. I will take care that ho <lb/>
            shall have drunk a little freely when he goes to bed. If you <lb/>
            obtain your wishes, perhaps you may be cured of your <lb/>
            passion. The first gratification sometimes extinguishes the <lb/>
            flame of desire. Love soon finds its end in satiety: but <lb/>
            if yours (which I hope will not be the case) should still <lb/>
            continue, we may perhaps find some other scheme to satisfy <lb/>
            it; at present let us attend to this which I have pro­ <lb/>
            posed."</p>
          <p>“ ‘ Demæneta eagerly embraced the proposal, and desired <lb/>
            her to put it into immediate execution. Thisbe demanded <lb/>
            a day only for preparation ; and going directly to Arsinoe, <lb/>
            asked her if she knew Teledemus. Arsinoë replying that <lb/>
            she did, Receive us then," says she, " this evening into <lb/>
            vour house; I have promised to sleep with him to-night: <lb/>
            he will come first; I shall follow, when I have put my mis­ <lb/>
            tress to bed." Then hastening into the country to Aristip­ <lb/>
            pus, she thus addressed him: “ I come, master, to accuse <lb/>
            myself; punish me as you think fit. I have been the cause <lb/>
            of your losing your son; not indeed willingly, but yet I was <lb/>
            instrumental in his destruction: for when I perceived that <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δεύτερος ἔσται πλου̃ς</foreign>, we will go on a fresh tack. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            my mistress led a dissolute life, and injured your bed, I began <lb/>
            to fear for myself, lest I should suffer if she should be <lb/>
            detected by anybody else. I pitied you too, who received <lb/>
            such ill returns for all your affection ; I was afraid, however, <lb/>
            of mentioning the matter to you, but I discovered it to my <lb/>
            young master; and coining to him by night, to avoid obser­ <lb/>
            vation, I told him that an adulterer was sleeping with my <lb/>
            mistress. He, hurried on by resentment, mistook my mean­ <lb/>
            ing, and thought I said that an adulterer was then with her. <lb/>
            His passion rose; he snatched a sword, and ran madly on <lb/>
            towards your bedchamber. It was in vain I endeavoured <lb/>
            to detain him, and to assure hint that no adulterer was then <lb/>
            with my mistress ; he regarded not what I said, either made <lb/>
            deaf by rage, or imagining that I changed my purpose. The <lb/>
            rest you know. You have it in your power at least to clear <lb/>
            up the character of your banished son, and to punish her <lb/>
            who has injured both of you; for I will shew you to-day <lb/>
            Demæneta with an adulterer, in a strange house without <lb/>
            the city, and in bed."</p>
          <p>“‛If you can do that,” said Aristippus, “ your freedom <lb/>
            shall be your reward. I shall, perhaps, take some com­ <lb/>
            fort in life, when I have got rid of this wicked woman. I <lb/>
            have for some time been uneasy within myself: I have <lb/>
            suspected her; but, having no proofs, I was silent. But <lb/>
            what must we do now ? “You know," said she, " the <lb/>
            garden where is the monument of the Epicureans: come <lb/>
            there in the evening, and wait for me." And having so <lb/>
            said, away she goes; and coming to Demæneta, " Dress <lb/>
            yourself," the cries, " immediately ; neglect nothing that can <lb/>
            set off your person ; everything that I have promised you is <lb/>
            ready. —Demæneta did as she was desired, and adorned her­ <lb/>
            self with all her skill; and in the evening Thisbe attended her to <lb/>
            the place of assignation. When they came near she desired her <lb/>
            to stop a little; and going forwards she begged Arsinoẽ to <lb/>
            step into the next house, and leave her at liberty in her own ; <lb/>
            for the wished to spare the young man’s blushes, who was but <lb/>
            lately initiated into love affairs; and, having persuaded her, <lb/>
            she returned, introduced Demaeneta, put her to bed, took away <lb/>
            the light (lest, forsooth, you, who were then safe at Ægina, <lb/>
            should discover her), and entreated her to enjoy the good <lb/>
            fortune which awaited her in silence. " I will now go," said <note type="footnote"> O </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            she,“ and bring the vouth to you; he is drinking at a house <lb/>
            in the neighbo rhood.”—Away she flies where Aristippus <lb/>
            was waiting, and exhorts him to go immediately and bind <lb/>
            the adulterer fast. He follows her, rushes into the house, <lb/>
            and, by help of a little moonlight which shone, with difficulty <lb/>
            finding the bed, exclaims, " I have caught you now, you <lb/>
            abandoned creature! Thisbe immediately upon this <lb/>
            exclamation bangs to the door on the other side, and cries <lb/>
            out,“ What untoward fortune! the adulterer has escaped; <lb/>
            but take care at least that you secure the adulteress.”— <lb/>
            “ Make yourself easy," he replied ; " I have secured this <lb/>
            wicked woman, whom I was the most desirous of taking <lb/>
            and seizing her, he began to drag her towards the city. But <lb/>
            she feeling deeply the situation the was in, the disappoint­ <lb/>
            ment of her hopes, the ignominy which must attend her <lb/>
            offences, and the punishment which awaited them, vexed and <lb/>
            enraged at being deceived and detected, when she came near <lb/>
            the pit which is in the Academy (you know the place where <lb/>
            our generals sacrifice to the Manes of our heroes), suddenly <lb/>
            disengaging herself from the hands of the old man, flung <lb/>
            herself headlong in : and thus she died- a wretched ,death, <lb/>
            suited for a wretch like herself.</p>
          <p>“‛ Upon this Aristippus cried out," You have yourself anti­ <lb/>
            cipated the justice of the laws," and the next day he laid the <lb/>
            whole matter before the people; and having with difficulty ob­ <lb/>
            tained his pardon, consulted his friends and acquaintance <lb/>
            how best he could obtain your recall. What success he has <lb/>
            met with 1 cannot inform you of; for I have been obliged, <lb/>
            as you see, to sail here on my own private business. But I <lb/>
            think you have the greatest reason to expect that the people <lb/>
            will consent to your return, and that your father will him­ <lb/>
            self come to seek you, and conduct you home.—Here <lb/>
            Charias ended his recital. How I came to this place, and <lb/>
            what have been my fortunes since, would take up more time <lb/>
            and words than there is at present opportunity for."</p>
          <p>Having said this, he wept ; the strangers wept with him, <lb/>
            seemingly for his calamities, really, perhaps, in remembrance <lb/>
            of their own : nor would they have ceased from lamentation, <lb/>
            had not sleep coming over them through the luxury of grief, <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κακή κακω̃ς</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            at length dried their tears. They then lay in repose, but <lb/>
            Thyamis (for that was the name of the pirate captain) <lb/>
            having slept quietly the first part of the night, was after­ <lb/>
            wards disturbed by wandering dreams; and starting from <lb/>
            his sleep, and pondering what they should mean, was kept <lb/>
            awake by his perplexities the remainder of the night. For <lb/>
            about the time when the cocks crow (whether a natural <lb/>
            instinct induces them to salute the returning sun, or a feel­ <lb/>
            ing of warmth and a desire of food and motion excites them <lb/>
            to rouse those who are about them with their song) the <lb/>
            following vision appeared to him.</p>
          <p>He seemed to be in Memphis, his native city; and enter­ <lb/>
            ing into the temple of Isis, he saw it shining with the splen­ <lb/>
            dour of a thousand lighted lamps; the altars were filled with <lb/>
            bleeding victims of all sorts; all the avenues of the temple <lb/>
            were crowded with people, and resounded with the noise of <lb/>
            the passing throngs. When he had penetrated to the inmost <lb/>
            sanctuary of the edifice, the goddess seemed to meet him, <lb/>
            to give Chariclea into his hands, and to say, " 0 Thyamis, I <lb/>
            deliver this maiden to you; but though having you shall not <lb/>
            have her, but shall be unjust, and kill your guest; yet she <lb/>
            shall not be killed.”—This dream troubled him, and he <lb/>
            turned it every way in his mind; at length, wearied with <lb/>
            conjectures, he wrested its signification to his own wishes. <lb/>
            You shall have her, and not have her; that is, you shall have <lb/>
            her as a wife, not as a virgin: and as for the killing, he un­ <lb/>
            derstood it to mean, thou shalt wound her virginity, but the <lb/>
            wound shall not be mortal. And thus, led by his desires, <lb/>
            he interpreted his vision.—When the morning dawned, he <lb/>
            called his principal followers about him, and ordered their <lb/>
            booty, which he called by the specious name of spoils, to bo <lb/>
            brought out into the midst; and sending for Cnemon, <lb/>
            directed him to bring with him the captives whom he had <lb/>
            the care of. When they were being brought, " What <lb/>
            fortune they exclaimed, " awaits us now ?” and besought <lb/>
            the protection and assistance of Cnemon. He promised to <lb/>
            do all that was in his power for them, and comforted and <lb/>
            encouraged them. He told them that the pirate captain <lb/>
            had nothing barbarous in his disposition ; that his manners <lb/>
            were rather gentle; that he belonged to an illustrious <lb/>
            family, and from necessity alone had embraced this kind of <note type="footnote"> o 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            life; When all were met together, and they too made their <lb/>
            appearance, Thyamis, seating himself on an eminence, and <lb/>
            ordering Cnemon, who understood the Egyptian tongue, <lb/>
            (whereas he himself could not speak Greek) to inter­ <lb/>
            pret what he said to the captives, thus addressed the <lb/>
            assembly :­</p>
          <p>"You know, comrades, what my sentiments have always <lb/>
            been towards you. You are not ignorant, how being the <lb/>
            son of the high-priest of Memphis, and being frustrated of <lb/>
            succeeding to the office * after the departure of my father, <lb/>
            my younger brother against all law depriving me of it, I <lb/>
            fled to you, that I might revenge the injury, and recover my <lb/>
            dignity. I have been thought worthy to command you, <lb/>
            and yet I have never arrogated any particular privileges to <lb/>
            myself: if money was to be distributed, I desired only an <lb/>
            equal share of it; if captives were to be sold, I brought <lb/>
            their price into the common stock; for I have always <lb/>
            deemed it to be the part of a valiant leader, to take the <lb/>
            larger share of toil, and only an equal share of spoils. As <lb/>
            to the captives, those men whose strength of body promised <lb/>
            to be serviceable to us, I kept for ourselves ; the weaker I <lb/>
            sold. I never abused the women . Those of any rank I <lb/>
            suffered to redeem themselves with money ; and sometimes, <lb/>
            out of compassion, dismissed them without ransom : those <lb/>
            of inferior condition, who, if they had not been taken, would <lb/>
            have passed their lives in servile offices, I employed In such <lb/>
            services as they had been accustomed to. But now I do ask <lb/>
            one part of these spoils for myself, this foreign maiden. I <lb/>
            might take her by my own authority, but 1 would rather <lb/>
            receive her by your common consent; for it were foolish <lb/>
            in me to do anything with a prisoner against the will of my <lb/>
            friends. Neither do I ask this favour of you gratis; I am <lb/>
            willing, in recompense for it, to resign my share in all the <lb/>
            other booty. For since the priestly caste despises common <lb/>
            amours, I am determined to take this maiden to myself, not <lb/>
            out of mere lust, but for the sake of offspring. And I will <lb/>
            explain to you the reasons which induce me to do so.</p>
          <p>" In the first place she appears to me to be well born : I <lb/>
            form this conjecture both from the riches which were found <note type="footnote"> * The succession to the Egyptian priesthood was hereditary.– <lb/>

            about her, and from her not being depressed by her cala­ <lb/>
            mities, but, seeming to rise superior to them; I am con­ <lb/>
            vinced that her disposition is good and virtuous; for, if in <lb/>
            beauty she surpasses all, and by her looks awes all beholders <lb/>
            into respect, can we do otherwise than think highly of her ? <lb/>
            But what recommends her above every thing to me is, that <lb/>
            she appears to be a priestess of some god; for, in all her <lb/>
            misfortunes, she has with a pious regard refused to lay aside <lb/>
            her sacred robe and chaplet. Where then can I a priest <lb/>
            find a partner more fitting for me, than one who is herself <lb/>
            a priestess ? "</p>
          <p>The applause of the whole company testified their appro­ <lb/>
            bation. They exhorted him to marry, and wished him all <lb/>
            possible happiness. He then pursued his discourse :—" I <lb/>
            thank you, comrades; but it will now be proper to inquire <lb/>
            how far my proposal is agreeable to this maiden. Were I <lb/>
            disposed to use the power which fate has put into my hands, <lb/>
            my will would be sufficient; they who can compel have no <lb/>
            need to entreat. But in lawful marriage, the inclination of <lb/>
            both parties ought to coincide." And turning to Chariclea, <lb/>
            he said, "How, maiden, do you like my offer ? What is <lb/>
            your country, and who were your parents ? ” She, keeping <lb/>
            her eye a considerable time on the ground, and moving <lb/>
            slowly her head, seemed to meditate what she should answer. <lb/>
            At length, raising herself gently towards Thyamis, and <lb/>
            dazzling him with more than her usual charms (for her eyes <lb/>
            shone with uncommon lustre, and the circumstances she was <lb/>
            in gave an additional glow to her cheeks), Cnemon serving <lb/>
            as interpreter, she thus addressed him :</p>
          <p>" It might perhaps have been more proper for my brother <lb/>
            Thengenes to speak on this occasion; for silence, I think, <lb/>
            best becomes women, especially in a company of men. Since, <lb/>
            however, you address yourself to me, and shew this first <lb/>
            mark of humanity, in that you seek to obtain what you <lb/>
            desire, by persuasion rather than force ; since the main sub­ <lb/>
            ject of your discourse relates to me alone; I am compelled <lb/>
            to lay aside the common reserve of my sex, and to explain <lb/>
            myself in regard to the proposal of marriage which you have <lb/>
            made, even before such an audience. Hear then what is <lb/>
            our state and condition.</p>
          <p>" Our country is Ionia; our family one of the most illus­ <lb/>
            trious in Ephesus. In early youth, as the laws appointed, <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            we entered into the priesthood. I was consecrated to <lb/>
            Diana, my brother to Apollo. But as the office is an annual <lb/>
            one, and the time was elapsed, we were going to Delos <lb/>
            to exhibit games* according to the custom of our coun­ <lb/>
            try, and to lay down the priesthood. We loaded a ship <lb/>
            therefore with gold, silver, costly garments, and other things <lb/>
            necessary for the show and the entertainment which we <lb/>
            were to give to the people. We set sail; our parents being <lb/>
            advanced in years, and afraid of the sea, remained at home: <lb/>
            but a great number of our fellow citizens attended us, some <lb/>
            on board our ships, others in vessels of their own. When <lb/>
            we had completed the greatest part of our voyage, a tem­ <lb/>
            pest suddenly arose ; winds and hurricanes, raising the <lb/>
            waves, drove the ship out of its course. The pilot yielded <lb/>
            at length to the fury of the storm; and deserting the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of the ship, let her drive at the mercy of the winds. <lb/>
            We scudded before them for seven days and nights; and at <lb/>
            length were cast upon the shore where you found us, and <lb/>
            where you saw the slaughter which had happened there. <lb/>
            Rejoicing at our preservation, we gave an entertainment to <lb/>
            the ship's company. In the midst of it, a party of the <lb/>
            sailors, who had conspired to make themselves masters of <lb/>
            our riches, by taking away our lives, attacked us; our <lb/>
            friends defended us; a dreadful combat ensued, which was <lb/>
            coutinued with such rage and animosity, on both sides, that <lb/>
            of the whole number engaged we alone survived (would to <lb/>
            God we had not!), miserable remains of that unhappy day; <lb/>
            in one thing alone fortunate, in that some pitying deity has <lb/>
            brought us into your hands ; and, instead of death which we i <lb/>
            feared, we are now to deliberate upon a marriage. I do not <lb/>
            by any means decline the offer. Prisoner as I am, I ought <lb/>
            to esteem it an honour and a happiness to be permitted <lb/>
            to aspire to the bed of my conqueror. It seems too, <lb/>
            to be by a particular providence of the gods, that I, a <lb/>
            priestess, should be united to the son of a high priest. <lb/>
            One thing alone I beg of you, 0 Thyamis. Permit me, at <lb/>
            the first city I arrive at in which there is a temple or altar <lb/>
            of Apollo, to resign my priesthood, and lay aside these <note type="footnote">* <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρίαν ήγομεν</foreign>. The Athenians made a solemn voyage to Delos <lb/>

            badges of my office: this perhaps would with most pro­ <lb/>
            priety be done in Memphis, when you shall have recovered <lb/>
            the dignity you are entitled to. Thus would our wedlock <lb/>
            be celebrated with better auspices, joined with victory and <lb/>
            prosperous success: but, if you would have it sooner, be it <lb/>
            as you please; let me only first perform those rites which <lb/>
            the custom of my country demands. This I know you will <lb/>
            not refuse me, as you have yourself been, as you say, dedi­ <lb/>
            cated to holy things from childhood, and have just and <lb/>
            reverend notions of what relates to the gods."</p>
          <p>Here who ceased, and her tears began to flow. Her <lb/>
            speech was followed by the approbation and applause of the <lb/>
            company, who bid her do thus, and promised her their aid. <lb/>
            Thyamis could not help joining with them, though he was <lb/>
            not entirely satisfied, for his eager desire to possess Chari­ <lb/>
            clea made him think even the present hour an unreason­ <lb/>
            able delay. Her words, however, like the syren’s song, <lb/>
            soothed him, and compelled his assent ; he thought, too, he <lb/>
            saw in this some relation to his dream, and brought himself <lb/>
            to agree that the wedding should be celebrated at Memphis. <lb/>
            He then dismissed the company, having first divided the <lb/>
            spoils, a great part of the choicest of which were forced <lb/>
            upon him by his people.</p>
          <p>He gave orders that, in ten days, they should all be <lb/>
            ready to march to Memphis ; and sent the Greeks to the <lb/>
            habitation in which he had before placed them. Cnemon, <lb/>
            too, by his command, attended them no longer now as a <lb/>
            guard, but as a companion: their entertainment was the <lb/>
            best which Thyamis could afford ; and Thengenes, for hid <lb/>
            sister’s sake, partook of the same handsome treament. He <lb/>
            determined within himself to see Chariclea as seldom as <lb/>
            possible, lest the sight of her should inflame the desire <lb/>
            which tormented him, and urge hint on to do anything <lb/>
            inconsistent with what he had agreed to and premised. He <lb/>
            deprived himself, therefore, of that company in which he <lb/>
            most delighted, fearing that to converse with her, and to <lb/>
            restrain himself within proper bounds, would be more than <lb/>
            be could answer for. When the crew had dispersed, each <lb/>
            to his habitation in the lake, Cnemon went to some dis­ <lb/>
            tance from it, in search of the herb which he had promised <lb/>
            to procure for Thengenes ; and Theagenes, taking the <lb/>
            opportunity of his absence, began to weep and lament, not <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            addressing himself to Chariclea, but calling earnestly upon <lb/>
            the gods: and she with tender solicitude inquiring whether <lb/>
            he was only lamenting their common misfortunes, or suf­ <lb/>
            fering any new addition to them ?—" What can be newer or <lb/>
            more unworthy," he replied, " than the breaking of vows <lb/>
            and promises ? than that Chariclea, entirely forgetting me, <lb/>
            should give her consent to another marriage?"—"God <lb/>
            forbid!" replied the maiden; "let not your reproaches <lb/>
            increase the load of my calamities; nor, after so long an <lb/>
            experience of my fidelity, lightly suspect a measure which <lb/>
            the immediate necessity of the moment compelled me to <lb/>
            adopt: sooner will you change than find me changed in <lb/>
            regard to you. I can bear in fortune; nor shall any force <lb/>
            compel me to do anything unworthy of the modesty and <lb/>
            virtue of my sex. In one thing alone, I own, I am immo­ <lb/>
            derate, my love for you; but then it is a lawful one; and, <lb/>
            however great, it did not throw me inconsiderately into your <lb/>
            power; I resigned myself to lou on the most honourable <lb/>
            conditions; I have hitherto lived with you in the most <lb/>
            inviolate purity, resisting all your solicitations, and looking <lb/>
            forward to a lawful opportunity of completing that marriage <lb/>
            to which we are solemnly pledged. Can you then be so <lb/>
            unreasonable as to think it possible that 1 should prefer a <lb/>
            barbarian to a Greek ? a pirate, to one to whom I aID <lb/>
            bound by so many ties?"—"What, then," said Theagenes, <lb/>
            " was the meaning of that fine speech of yours ? To call <lb/>
            me your brother, indeed, was prudent enough, to keep <lb/>
            Thyamis from suspecting the real nature of our love, and to <lb/>
            induce him to let us continue together. I understood, too, <lb/>
            the meaning of your veiling the true circumstances of our <lb/>
            voyage under the fictions of Ionia and Delos. But so <lb/>
            readily to accept his proposals, to promise to marry him, <lb/>
            nay, to fix a time for the ceremony-this, I own, disturbs <lb/>
            me, and passes my comprehension; but I had rather sink <lb/>
            into the earth than see such an end of all my hopes and <lb/>
            labours on your account."</p>
          <p>Chariclea flung her arms round Theagenes, gave him <lb/>
            a thousand kisses, and bedewing him with tears, cried <lb/>
            out, " How delightful to me are these apprehensions of <lb/>
            yours! They prove that all the troubles you have under­ <lb/>
            gone have in no degree weakened your love; but know, <lb/>
            0 my dear Theagenes, that unless I had promised as I did, <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            we should not now be talking together. You must be sen- <lb/>
            sible that contradiction only adds force to violent passion; <lb/>
            seeming compliance allays the impulse in its birth, and the <lb/>
            allurement of promises lulls the violence of desire. Your <lb/>
            rough lovers think they have got something when they have <lb/>
            obtained a promise: and, relying upon the faith of it, <lb/>
            become quieter, feeding themselves with hope. I, being <lb/>
            aware of this, in words resigned myself up to him, com­ <lb/>
            mitting what shall follow to the gods, and to that genius <lb/>
            who presides over our loves.</p>
          <p>" A short interval of time has frequently afforded means <lb/>
            of safety, which the wisest counsels of men could not have <lb/>
            foreseen. I saw nothing better to be done than to endea­ <lb/>
            vour to ward off a certain and imminent danger, by a <lb/>
            present, though uncertain, remedy. We must, therefore, <lb/>
            my dearest Theagenes, use this fiction as our best ally, <lb/>
            and carefully conceal the truth even from Cnemon ; for <lb/>
            though he seems friendly to us, and is a Greek, yet he is a <lb/>
            captive, and likely, perhaps, to do anything which may ingra­ <lb/>
            tiate him with his master. Our friendship with him is as <lb/>
            yet too new, neither is there any relation between us sum­ <lb/>
            ciently strong to give us a certain assurance of his fidelity. <lb/>
            If he suspects, therefore, and inquires into our real situa­ <lb/>
            tion, we must deny it: for even a falsehood is commendable <lb/>
            when it is of service to those who use it, and does no injury <lb/>
            to the hearers of it."</p>
          <p>While Chariclea was thus suggesting this course, Cnemon <lb/>
            comes running in, with an altered countenance, and seem­ <lb/>
            ingly in much agitation. " 0 Theagenes," he cried, " I have <lb/>
            brought you the herb I mentioned; apply it, and it will <lb/>
            heal your wounds; but you must now, 1 tear, prepare your­ <lb/>
            self for others, and a slaughter equal to that which you <lb/>
            have lately been an actor in." Theagenes desiring him to <lb/>
            explain himself, " There is no time at present;" he replied, <lb/>
            " for explanation; action will probably anticipate words; <lb/>
            but do you and Chariclea follow me as fast as you can ;" <lb/>
            and taking them with him, he brought them to Thyamis- <lb/>
            They found him employed in burnishing his helmet and <lb/>
            sharpening his spear. "Very scasonably," he exclaimed, <lb/>
            "are you employed about your arms; put them on as fast <lb/>
            as you can, and command all your men to do the same, for <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            a hostile force is approaching greater than ever threatened <lb/>
            us before, and they must now be very near. I saw them <lb/>
            advancing over the top of the neighbouring hill, and have <lb/>
            made all possible haste to bring you information, giving <lb/>
            the alarm to every one I met with in my passage."</p>
          <p>Thyamis, at these tidings, started up and cried out, <lb/>
            "Where is Chariclea?" as if he were more apprehensive <lb/>
            for her than for himself. When Cnemon showed her <lb/>
            standing near the door. " Lead this maiden privately," <lb/>
            says he, " into the cave where I keep my treasures, and <lb/>
            forget not to replace as usual the covering of it; having <lb/>
            done this, return to me as fast as you can : meanwhile, I <lb/>
            will prepare for the storm - of battle which awaits us." <lb/>
            Having said this, he ordered his lieutenant to bring forth <lb/>
            a victim, that he might begin the engagement after a duo <lb/>
            sacrifice to his country's gods. Cnemon proceeded to <lb/>
            execute his commission, and leading off Chariclea, who <lb/>
            turned earnestly towards Theagenes, and lamented her <lb/>
            hard fate, he let her down into the cave. This was not, as <lb/>
            many are, the work of nature, an accidental excavation, but <lb/>
            the contrivance of the pirates, who, imitating her opera­ <lb/>
            tions, had hollowed out an artificial cavern for the reception <lb/>
            of their treasures. It was formed in this manner: its <lb/>
            entrance,. narrow and dark, was under the doors of a <lb/>
            hidden chamber, the threshold became, in case of need, <lb/>
            -a second door, for farther descent; it fitted exactly, and <lb/>
            could be lifted up with great facility; the rest of the <note type="footnote">* This description is very obscure in the original; the meaning <lb/>
            seems to be, that the descent to the cavern was effected by lifting up <lb/>
            an oblong stone, bearing the appearance of a threshold, but serving its <lb/>
            a door. The following is the version of the Italian translator : " L'en­ <lb/>
            trata era stretta e oscura, sottoposta all' entrata d'uno occulto edificio, <lb/>
            in guisa che la soglia della prima entrata faceva un ultra porta ad uso <lb/>
            di scendere," &amp;c. The poet, Waiter Lisle, gives the passage thus <lb/>
            " A cave there was, it opened well and shut <lb/>
            With narrow door of stone, that threshold was <lb/>
            T' an upper room. Within, a maze it has <lb/>
            Of sundrie wayes, entangled (like the roots <lb/>
            Of thicke-set trees, amids and all abouts), <lb/>
            That meet in plaine." <lb/>
            And wishing to embellish the picture, he adds— <lb/>
            " With scales of crocodile <lb/>
            The roofe is pav'd, brought hither from the Nile."</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            cave was cut into various winding passages, which, now <lb/>
            diverging, now returning, with a multitude of ramifi­ <lb/>
            cations, converged at last into an open space at the bottom, <lb/>
            which received an uncertain light from an aperture at the <lb/>
            extremity of the lake. Here Cnemon introduced Chariclea, <lb/>
            and led her to the farthest recess, encouraging and pro­ <lb/>
            mising her that he and Theagenes would come to her in the <lb/>
            evening: and that he would not suffer him to engage in the <lb/>
            battle which impended. Chariclea was unable to answer him; <lb/>
            and he went out of the cave, leaving her half dead, silent, <lb/>
            and stupified, as if her soul had been separated from her <lb/>
            with Theagenes. He shut down the door, dropping a tear <lb/>
            for her as he did it, and for the necessity he was under of <lb/>
            burying her in a manner alive, and consigning the brightest <lb/>
            of human forms to darkness and obscurity. He made what <lb/>
            haste he could to Thyamis. He found him burning with <lb/>
            ardour for the fight, and Theagenes by his side splendidly <lb/>
            armed; he was even to frenzy rousing the spirits of his fol­ <lb/>
            lowers who surrounded him, and thus began to address them:</p>
          <p>" There is no need, comrades, to address you in a long <lb/>
            exhortation: you want no encouragement, to whom war is <lb/>
            the breath of life; and the sudden approach of the enemy <lb/>
            cuts off all space for words; it becomes us to prepare to <lb/>
            resist force by force; not to do so would betray an absence <lb/>
            of all energy. I do not put you in mind of your wives and <lb/>
            children as is usual on these occasions, though nothing but <lb/>
            victory can preserve them from destruction and violation. <lb/>
            This contest is for our very being and existence; no quarter, <lb/>
            no truce, ever takes place in piratic warfare; we must <lb/>
            either conquer or die. Let us exert, then, our force to tho <lb/>
            utmost, and with determined minds fall upon the enemy."</p>
          <p>Having said this, he looked round for his lieutenant, <lb/>
            Thermuthis, and called him several times by his name. <lb/>
            When he nowhere appeared, throwing out hasty threats <lb/>
            against him, he rushed on towards the ferry. The battle <lb/>
            was already begun, and he could see at a distance those <lb/>
            who inhabited the extremities and approaches of the lake <lb/>
            in the fact of being routed by the enemy, who set on fire <lb/>
            the boats and huts of those who fell or fled. The flames <lb/>
            spread to the neighbouring morass, caught hold of the <lb/>
            reeds which grew there in great abundance, dazzled every <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            eye with an almost intolerable blaze, and, crackling and <lb/>
            roaring, stunned their ears.</p>
          <p>War. now nppeared in all its horrid forms: the inhabitants <lb/>
            for some time, with readiness and energy, supported and <lb/>
            repelled the attack; but being astonished by the sudden <lb/>
            incursion, and pressed by the superior numbers of the <lb/>
            enemy, those on the land gave way, and many of those on <lb/>
            the lake, together with their boats and habitations, were <lb/>
            overwhelmed in the waters! every dreadful sound now struck <lb/>
            the air, as the conflict raged both by land and water; <lb/>
            groans and shouts were mingled, the lake was discoloured <lb/>
            with blood, all were involved in fire or water. Thyamis, at <lb/>
            this sight, called to mind his dream, and the temple of Isis <lb/>
            shining with lamps, and flowing with the blood of victims; <lb/>
            he saw a resemblance in it to the scene before him, and <lb/>
            began to fear that he must give up his former favourable <lb/>
            interpretation ; that Chariclea was destined to fall in this <lb/>
            tumult, and that so having had her in his possession, he <lb/>
            should now have her no longer; that she would be slain, <lb/>
            not merely be wounded in her virginity; exclaiming, there­ <lb/>
            fore against the goddess, for having deceived him, and <lb/>
            unable to bear the thought that any one else should possess <lb/>
            Chariclea, he ordered the men who were about hint to halt, <lb/>
            and if they were obliged to engage, to defend themselves as <lb/>
            well as they could, by retiring behind, and making sallies <lb/>
            from, the numerous little islands: as by so doing they might, <lb/>
            for some time, be able to resist the attack of the enemy. He <lb/>
            then, under pretence of going to seek Thermuthis, and sacri­ <lb/>
            ficing to his household gods, returned in great agitation to <lb/>
            his tent, suffering no one to follow him.</p>

            them from the injuries and insults of the enemy. Stimulated <lb/>
            by some of these motives, Thvamis, forgetting the urgent <lb/>
            danger which pressed upon him, and the enemies by whom he <lb/>
            was surrounded as by a net; burning with anger, love, and <lb/>
            jealousy, rushed headlong to the cave: he poured out his <lb/>
            Egyptian exclamations with a loud voice, and soon after his <lb/>
            entrance, being addressed by some one in the Greek tongue, <lb/>
            the voice guided him to the person; he seized her hair with <lb/>
            his left hand, and with his right plunged his sword into her <lb/>
            bosom: the unfortunate creature sank down, uttering a last <lb/>
            and piteous groan. Issuing forth and closing the trap-door, <lb/>
            he threw a little dust over her, and dropping a tear he <lb/>
            exclaimed, " Are these then the nuptial presents you were <lb/>
            to expect from me ! " When he arrived at the boats, he <lb/>
            saw his people ready to fly as the enemy approached near, <lb/>
            and Thermuthis having now made his appearance, preparing <lb/>
            to begin the sacrifice : having abused him for his unseason­ <lb/>
            able absence, and told him that he had already offered <lb/>
            up the most beauteous of victims, he, Thermuthis and the <lb/>
            rower got into a boat: their small vessels would not hold <lb/>
            more, being made out of the trunk of a tree rudely hollowed. <lb/>
            Theagenes and Cnemon got into another, and in the same <lb/>
            manner all the rest embarked.</p>
          <p>When they had proceeded a little from the shore, <lb/>
            rowing round the side rather than launching out into <lb/>
            the deep, they lay upon their oars, and drew up in a line, <lb/>
            to receive the enemy; but at their approach, a sudden <lb/>
            panic seized the pirates, and not sustaining the first <lb/>
            hostile shout of their opponents, they fled in disorder: <lb/>
            Cnemon and Theagenes gradually retired, but not from fear: <lb/>
            Thyamis alone disdained to fly ; and perhaps not wishing to <lb/>
            survive Chariclea, rushed into the midst of his foes. A cry <lb/>
            was instantly heard among them, " This is Thyamis, let all <lb/>
            have an eye to him :" immediately they turned their boats <lb/>
            and surrounded him ; he, vigorously fighting, wounded some <lb/>
            and killed others, and yet strange was that which ensued: <lb/>
            out of so great a multitude no one lifted up a sword, or cast <lb/>
            a dart at him, but every one did their utmost to capture <lb/>
            him alive. He continued manfully to resist, till at length his <lb/>
            spear was wrested from him, and he bad lost his lieutenant, <lb/>
            who had nobly seconded him; and who, having received, as <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            he thought, a mortal wound, leaped into the lake, and with <lb/>
            great difficulty reached the shore, no one offering to pursue <lb/>
            him; for now they had laid hold on Thyamis, and esteemed <lb/>
            the capture of one man a victory; and though he had <lb/>
            destroyed so many of their men, their joy at having taken <lb/>
            him alive far exceeded their grief for the loss of their corn. <lb/>
            rades; for gain is dearer to robbers than their lives; and <lb/>
            friendship and relationship are only so far considered among <lb/>
            them as they conduce to this main end.</p>
          <p>The leaders of this attack were the men who had fled from <lb/>
            Thyamis and his followers at the Heracleotic mouth of the <lb/>
            Nile: they, enraged at the loss of a booty, which though <lb/>
            plunder, they considered as their own, gathered their friends <lb/>
            together, and many others from the neighbouring towns, <lb/>
            by proposing to them an equal division of the spoils; and <lb/>
            became their guides in the expedition.</p>
          <p>The reason why they were so desirous of taking Thyamis <lb/>
            alive was this: Petosiris, who resided at Memphis, was his <lb/>
            younger brother; by his artifices he had unlawfully de­ <lb/>
            prived Thyamis of the priesthood, and hearing that he was <lb/>
            now at the head of the pirates, he feared that he might take <lb/>
            some opportunity to attack him, or that in time his treachery <lb/>
            might be discovered; he was besides suspected of having <lb/>
            made away with his brother, who nowhere appeared. For <lb/>
            these reasons he proclaimed great rewards among all the­ <lb/>
            nests of pirates in his neighbourhood, to any one who <lb/>
            should capture him alive: they, stimulated by these offers, <lb/>
            and in the heat of battle, not losing sight of gain, took him <lb/>
            prisoner at the price of many of their lives. They sent him, <lb/>
            under a strong guard, to the main land, he reproaching <lb/>
            them all the while for their seeming lenity, and bearing <lb/>
            bonds much more indignantly than he would have borne <lb/>
            death. The rest proceeded towards the island in quest of <lb/>
            treasures and spoil; but when, after a long and strict search, <lb/>
            they found nothing of any consequence, some few things <lb/>
            excepted, which out of hurry or forgetfulness were left out <lb/>
            of the cavern, they set fire to the tents; and the evening <lb/>
            coming on, fearing to remain there any longer, lest they <lb/>
            should be surprised by the enemy whom they had driven <lb/>
            thence, they returned to their companions upon the con­ <lb/>
            tinent.</p><pb n="31"/>

          <p>In this manner, as we have related, were the flames <lb/>
            spread over the lake; the conflagration escaped the <lb/>
            notice of Theagenes and Cnemon while the sun was above <lb/>
            the horizon, the superior lustre of that planet overcoming <lb/>
            the blaze; but when it set, when night came on, and the <lb/>
            fire had no longer any rival to contend with, it appeared at <lb/>
            a distance to their great consternation, as they began to <lb/>
            raise themselves out of the morass. Theagenes tearing his <lb/>
            hair, thus broke out into passionate exclamations; "May <lb/>
            this day be the last of my life; may my fears, cares, and <lb/>
            dangers now have an end, and my hopes and love conclude <lb/>
            together. Chariclea is no more, and I am undone ; in vain, <lb/>
            wretch, that I am, have I become a coward, and submitted <lb/>
            to an unmanly flight, that I might preserve myself for you, <lb/>
            the delight of my life. For you, alas! I live no longer; <lb/>
            you have fallen by an untimely death, nor was he on whom <lb/>
            you doated present to receive your latest breath ; but you <lb/>
            are become the prey of flames, and these are the nuptial <lb/>
            torches which cruel fate has lighted up for you. All is con­ <lb/>
            . sumed, and there now remains no trace of the most perfect <lb/>
            of human forms: O! most cruel and envious deities! a last <lb/>
            embrace is denied me:" and thus lamenting, he felt about <lb/>
            for his sword—Cnemon arrested his hand, and cried out, <lb/>
            " Why, Theagenes, do you lament her who is safe ? Chari­ <lb/>
            clea is alive; be comforted." " Away ! " he replied, " this <lb/>
            is a tale for chidren; why do you keep me from the death I <lb/>
            long for P " Cnemon swore to the truth of what he had <lb/>
            said, told him the orders of Tin amis, described the cave <lb/>
            where he had placed Chariclea; and assured him there was <lb/>
            not the smallest danger of the flames (cut off as they would <lb/>
            be) penetrating through the deep and winding avenues by <lb/>
            which she was protected.</p>
          <p>Theagenes at these assurances began to recover his <lb/>
            spirits, and hastened towards the island, having Chariclea, <lb/>
            and a joyful meeting in the cave before his eyes, ignorant, <lb/>
            alas! of the woes which awaited him there. They pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded forwards with great ardour, plying the oars them­ <lb/>
            selves, for their rower had fallen overboard in the confusion <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            of the first flight; they went on with an unsteady course <lb/>
            from inexperience in rowing, not able to keep stroke, and <lb/>
            the wind being against them; but their ardour overcame <lb/>
            their unskilfulness, and with great difficulty at last, and <lb/>
            bathed in sweat, they reached the shore, and ran eagerly <lb/>
            towards the tents. Of these they saw only the ashes, <lb/>
            they having been totally consumed; the stone, however, <lb/>
            which formed the threshold and entrance of the cavern, <lb/>
            was conspicuous enough; for the huts being built of reeds <lb/>
            and such slender materials, were soon consumed and turned <lb/>
            into a light ash, which the wind scattering away, left the <lb/>
            earth bare in many places for a passage, cooling it at the <lb/>
            same time with the blast.</p>
          <p>Finding some torches half burnt, and lighting some reeds <lb/>
            which remained, they opened the cave's mouth, and under <lb/>
            the guidance of Cnemon, descended into it. When they <lb/>
            bad gone a little way, Cnemon suddenly exclaimed, " O <lb/>
            God! what is this? we are undone, Chariclea is slain;" <lb/>
            and flinging his torch on the ground, extinguished it, and <lb/>
            falling on his knees, and covering his face with his hands, <lb/>
            began to weep. Theagenes threw himself upon the body, <lb/>
            and held it a long time in his arms, closely embraced; <lb/>
            Cnemon seeing him overwhelmed with this stroke, and <lb/>
            fearing when he recovered his senses he would make some <lb/>
            attempt upon himself, took away unobserved the sword <lb/>
            which hung by his side, and leaving him for a moment, ran <lb/>
            out to light his torch. While he was gone, the unhappy <lb/>
            lover broke out into mournful and tragic exclamations, <lb/>
            “ 0 intolerable calamity, and never-to-be-appeased wrath <lb/>
            of the gods ! what insatiable demon thus rages to my <lb/>
            destruction ? who, after having driven me from my country <lb/>
            through a thousand dangers of seas and pirates, having <lb/>
            delivered me up to marauders, and stript me of all I had, <lb/>
            when one only comfort was left me, has now deprived me <lb/>
            of that! Chat-idea is no more, she lies slain by a violent <lb/>
            death; doubtless, the has fallen in defence of her chastity, <lb/>
            determined to preserve herself unspotted for my sake. In <lb/>
            vain has her beauty bloomed both for herself and me; but, <lb/>
            O my love! have not you one last word left to speak to <lb/>
            me? Are life and breath for ever gone? Alas! you are <lb/>
            silent; that mouth, formerly the interpreter of the will of <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            heaven, is dumb, and darkness and destruction have over­ <lb/>
            whelmed the priestess of the gods. Those eyes glance no <lb/>
            more whose lustre dazzled all beholders, whose brightness, <lb/>
            if your murderer had met, he could not have executed his <lb/>
            purpose; what shall I call you, my wife ? but we were not <lb/>
            married; my contracted spouse ? but the contract has been <lb/>
            a fruitless one; let me call you by the sweetest of all <lb/>
            appellations, Chariclea. 0 Chariclea! if, where you are, <lb/>
            you are capable of receiving comfort, be comforted; you <lb/>
            have a faithful lover; we shall soon meet again; behold, I <lb/>
            sacrifice myself to your Manes, to you I pour out my own <lb/>
            blood in libations ;* this cavern, a rude sepulchre, shall retain <lb/>
            both our bodies; we shall be united in our deaths, though <lb/>
            fate forbade it in our lives." Saying this, he felt for his <lb/>
            sword, and not finding it, " 0 Cnemon," he exclaimed, <lb/>
            is you have undone me, and Chariclea too, for the second <lb/>
            time depriving her shade of the company it desires." While <lb/>
            he was thus speaking, a voice from the windings of the <lb/>
            cave was heard, calling Theagenes; he, not in the least <lb/>
            alarmed, replied, “ I come, my dearest life; your soul, I <lb/>
            see, still hovers above the earth, partly, perhaps, because <lb/>
            unwilling to leave that body, from which it has by violence <lb/>
            been expelled; and partly, because! wanting the rites ot <lb/>
            sepulture, you may be refused admittance in the shades <lb/>
            below." Cnemon now approached with the torch; again <lb/>
            the voice was heard, calling Theagenes; Cnemon instantly <lb/>
            exclaimed, "Ye gods! is not this the voice of Chariclea? <lb/>
            Theagenes, I think she is safe, for the sound seems to me <lb/>
            to proceed from that very part of the cavern where I know <lb/>
            I left her.”-“ Will you never cease attempting to deceive <lb/>
            me," replied Theagenes?—“ I am much deceived myself,” <lb/>
            replied the other, " if we find this corpse which lies before us <lb/>
            to be that of Chariclea;" and stooping down to examine <lb/>
            the countenance, "0 heavens!” he cried out, “ what do I <lb/>
            see? the face of Thisbe!” and starting back, he stood <lb/>
            petrified with astonishment. Theagenes, on the contrary, <note type="footnote"> * “ Te <lb/>

            now began to recover his spirits, and in his turn supported <lb/>
            and encouraged Cnemon, who was ready to faint; and <lb/>
            besought him that he would lead him instantly to Chariclea; <lb/>
            Cnemon, by degrees coming to himself, again examined the <lb/>
            body, which really was that of Thisbe; he knew, too, by its <lb/>
            hilt, the sword which Thyamis from rage and haste had <lb/>
            left sticking in the wound. He perceived also a tablet <lb/>
            appearing out of her bosom; he took it, and was beginning <lb/>
            to read what was written upon it; but Theagenes would <lb/>
            not suffer him, and earnestly entreated him, if all he saw <lb/>
            was not the illusion of some demon, that lie would take <lb/>
            him to Chariclea; you may afterwards, said he, read this <lb/>
            tablet. Cnemon obeyed; and, taking up the tablet and the <lb/>
            sword, hastened towards Chariclea. She, creeping on hands <lb/>
            and knees towards the sound of their voices as well as she <lb/>
            could, at length saw the light, flew to Theagenes, and hung <lb/>
            upon his neck. And mutually exclaiming, " And are you <lb/>
            restored to me, my dear Theagenes ? "—" Do you live,. <lb/>
            sweetest Chariclea ? " they fell in each others' arms upon <lb/>
            the ground; their voices murmuring and themselves dying <lb/>
            away. So much does a sudden rush of joy overpower the <lb/>
            human faculties, and excess of pleasure passes into pain. <lb/>
            Thus these lovers, unexpectedly preserved, seemed again in <lb/>
            danger, till Cnemon, observing a little water in a cleft of <lb/>
            the rock, took it up in the hollow of his hand, and sprinkling <lb/>
            it over their faces and nostrils, they came by degrees to <lb/>

            lying on the ground in each other's arms, they rose imme­ <lb/>
            diately, and blushing a little, especially Chariclea, began to <lb/>
            make excuses to Cnemon. He, smiling, turned the matter <lb/>
            into pleasantry.</p>
          <p>“ You will not find a severe censor in me," said he; <lb/>
            it whoever is but moderately acquainted with the passion of <lb/>
            love, will easily forgive its excesses. But there is one part <lb/>
            of your conduct, Theagenes, which I cannot approve of­ <lb/>
            indeed I was ashamed to see it—when you fell down, and <lb/>
            bewailed in so lamentable a manner a foreign woman, and <note type="footnote"> * “ .......0 my soul's joy I <lb/>

            you, that she, whom you professed to love best, was alive <lb/>
            and near you.”—“ Have done, Cnemon," he replied; “ do <lb/>
            not traduce me to Chariclea. You know I lamented her, <lb/>
            under the person of another; but since the kind gods have <lb/>
            shewn me that I was in an error, pray call to mind a little <lb/>
            your own fortitude. You joined your tears, at first, with <lb/>
            mine; but when you recognized the body which lay before <lb/>
            you, you started as from a demon on the stage, lOll in <lb/>
            armour, and with a sword, from a woman; you, a Grecian <lb/>
            warrior, from a corpse! "</p>
          <p>This raillery drew a short and forced smile from them, <lb/>
            mingled with tears; for such was their calamitous situation, <lb/>
            that grief and thought soon overpowered this gleam of <lb/>
            cheerfulness. A short silence ensued; when Chariclea* <lb/>
            gently moving her finger upon her check under the ear, <lb/>
            exclaimed, " I shall always esteem her blest, whoever she <lb/>
            be, for whom Theagenes is concerned; but, if you do not <lb/>
            think that love makes me too inquisitive, I should be glad <lb/>
            to know who is this happy damsel who has been thought <lb/>
            worthy of his tears; and by what error he could take a <lb/>
            stranger for me.”—“You will wonder when you hear," <lb/>
            replied Theagenes. “ Cnemon affirms, that these are the <lb/>
            remains of Thisbe, the Athenian singer, the plotter against <lb/>
            him and Demæneta.”—“ How," said the astonished Cha­ <lb/>

            Greece to the extremity of Egypt, like a deity in a tra­ <lb/>

            entrance ? "—" As to that, I am as much at a loss about it <lb/>
            as you can be," said Cnemon; " all I know of her adven­ <lb/>
            tures is this: After the tragical end of Demæneta, my <lb/>
            father laid before the people what had happened. They <lb/>
            pitied and pardoned him; and he was earnestly employed <lb/>
            in soliciting my recal. Thisbe made use of the leisure she <lb/>

            the inextinguishable envy of a courtezan. This was in­ <lb/>
            creased by her having seduced Nausicles, a rich merchant <lb/>
            of Naucratium, formerly a lover of Arsinoë; but who had <lb/>
            left her on pretence of being disgusted with the distortions <lb/>
            of her eyes and countenance, while the was playing on the <lb/>
            flute. Anger and jealousy raging in her bosom, she went <lb/>
            to the relations of Demæneta, and discovered to them the <lb/>
            snare which Thisbe had laid for their kinswoman; partly <lb/>
            from her own conjectures, and partly from what Thisbe <lb/>
            had told her. Their anger, however, fell first upon my <lb/>
            father; and they engaged the most skilful counsel to accuse <lb/>
            him to the people, as if he had put Demæneta to death <lb/>
            without trial or conviction; and had made use of the <lb/>
            adultery only as a pretext for her murder; and loudly <lb/>
            called upon him to produce the adulterer, or nt least to <lb/>
            name him; they concluded by insisting that Thisbe should <lb/>
            be put to the torture. My father readily agreed to this, <lb/>
            but she was not to be found; for, upon the first stirring of <lb/>
            the matter, she had taken flight with her merchant. The <lb/>
            people, angry at her escape, were in an ill humour to hear <lb/>
            the defence of the accused. They did not indeed convict <lb/>
            him of the murder, but found him guilty of being concerned <lb/>
            in the contrivance against Demæneta, and of my unjust <lb/>
            banishment. They exiled him from the city, and tined him <lb/>
            to the amount of the greatest part of his fortune. Such <lb/>
            were the fruits of his second marriage.</p>

            came into this cavern, and how she has been murdered in it, <lb/>
            must be explained to us, I believe, by some deity, for it <lb/>
            passes human comprehension; let us examine, however, the <lb/>
            tablet that was found in her bosom; perhaps that will give <lb/>
            us some information. With this he took it, and began to <lb/>
            read as follows:</p>
          <p>" ‘ Thisbe, formerly his enemy, but now his avenger, to <lb/>
            her master, Cnemon:</p>
          <p>" ‘ In the first place I inform you of the death of Demæ­ <lb/>
            neta, brought about on your account by my means; how it <lb/>
            happened, if you will admit me to your presence, I will <lb/>
            relate to you in person. I have been ten days on this <lb/>
            island, having been made captive by one of the robbers, who <lb/>
            boasts that he is lieutenant to the chief, and keeps me <lb/>
            closely confined-as he says, out of love; as I suppose, lest <lb/>
            I should be taken from him. By the kindness of the gods, <lb/>
            I have seen and recognized you, and send this tablet to you <lb/>
            privately by an old woman who waits upon me, commanding <lb/>
            her to deliver it to a handsome Greek, a favourite of the <lb/>
            chief. Deliver me from the power of these pirates, and <lb/>
            receive to yourself your handmaid; and, if you can prevail <lb/>
            upon yourself, preserve her; knowing that in what I acted <lb/>
            against you I was compelled, but the revenging you of your <lb/>
            enemy was my own voluntary act. But, if you still feel an <lb/>
            inextinguishable resentment against me, satiate it as you <lb/>
            please; only let me be in your hands, even if I am to die by <lb/>
            them; I prefer death from you, and to have the rites of my <lb/>
            country performed over my remains, to a life that is more <lb/>
            dreadful than death; and to the love of a barbarian, more <lb/>
            odious to me than the hatred of a Greek.<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign>—This was the <lb/>
            contents of the tablet.</p>
          <p>“ 0 Thisbe," said Cnemon, “ the gods have wisely or. <lb/>
            dained your death; and that you should become, even after <lb/>
            Your slaughter, the relater of your calamities; the Fury* who <lb/>
            has driven you through the world, has not ceased her aveng­ <lb/>
            ing pursuit, till she has made me, whom you have injured, <lb/>
            even in Egypt, a spectator of your punishment. But what <lb/>
            accident is it which has stopped your career, while perhaps <figure type="illustration">

              this letter of yours was only the forerunner of some new <lb/>
              practice against me P for I cannot help suspecting you even <lb/>
              now that you are dead. I fear lest the account of Demæ­ <lb/>
              neta'a death should be a fiction; lest those who have <lb/>
              informed me of it should have deceived me; lest you should <lb/>
              have crossed the seas with a design to renew in Egypt the <lb/>
              tragedies you have acted against me in Attica."—" 0 you <lb/>
              courageous fellow!" cries out Theagenes," will you never <lb/>
              cease to terrify yourself with shades and fancies ? You cannot <lb/>
              pretend that sibe has bewitched me, at any rate, for I have <lb/>
              had no part in the drama; assure yourself that no harm can <lb/>
              arise to you from this dead corpse, and pluck up your spirits: <lb/>
              but who has been so far your benefactor as to slay your <lb/>
              enemy, and how and when she dyscendrd here, I am utterly <lb/>
              at a loss to imagine."—" As to the matter in general I am <lb/>
              so too," replied Cnemon ; "but lie who slew her was cer­ <lb/>
              tainly Thyamis,-as I conjecture from the sword. which was <lb/>
              found near the body; I know it to be his, by the ivory hilt <lb/>
              carved into the form of an eagle."—"But can you con­ <lb/>
              jecture," said the other, "how, and when, and for what <lb/>
              cause, he committed this murder?"—"IIow should I <lb/>
              know that?" he answered. " This cavern has not had <lb/>
              the virtue of inspiring me, like that of Delphi or Tro­ <lb/>
              phonius."</p>
          <p>The mention of Delphi seemed to agitate Theagenes, <lb/>
            and drew tears from Charielea; they repeated the name <lb/>
            with great emotion. Cnemon was surprised, and could not <lb/>
            conceive why they were so affected by it. In this manner <lb/>
            they were engaged in the cave. Meanwhile Thermuthis, <lb/>
            the lieutenant of Thyamis, after he had been wounded and <lb/>
            bad got to land in the manner we have related, when night <lb/>
            came on, hastened towards the cavern in search of Thisbe; <lb/>
            for he it was who had placed her there. He had some days <lb/>
            before taken her by force from the merchant Nausicles in a <lb/>
            narrow mountain pass. On the tumult and attack which <lb/>
            soon after ensued, when he was sent by Thyamis in search <lb/>
            of a victim, he let her down into this cavern, that she might <lb/>
            be out of the reach of danger, and in his hurry and con­ <lb/>
            fusion left her near the entrance of it. Here she remained <lb/>
            out of fear, and ignorance of the winding passages which led <lb/>
            to the bottom; and hero Thyamis found and killed her by <lb/>
            mistake for Chariclea, Thermuthis proceeded on his way <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            to Thisbe. Upon reaching the island he hastened to the <lb/>
            tents; these be found in ashes: and having with some diffi­ <lb/>
            culty discovered the entrance of the cavern, by means of <lb/>
            the stone covering, he lighted a handful of reeds which yet <lb/>
            remained there, and hastened to descend into it.</p>
          <p>He called Thisbe by her name, in Greek; but when ho <lb/>
            saw her lying dead at his feet, he stood motionless with <lb/>
            horror and surprise. At length he heard a murmur and <lb/>
            distant sound of voices issuing from the hollow recesses of <lb/>
            the cave; for Theagencs and Cnemon were still conversing <lb/>
            together.</p>
          <p>These he concluded to be the murderers of Thisbe, and <lb/>
            was in doubt what he should do; for as was natural in a <lb/>
            ferocious pirate, his rage, raised to the highest pitch by this <lb/>
            disappointment of his desires, urged him to rush at onco <lb/>
            upon the supposed authors of it; but his want of arms <lb/>
            made him unwillingly more cautious. He concluded there­ <lb/>
            fore that it was best at first not to present himself as <lb/>
            an enemy, but if by any means he could possess himself of <lb/>
            arms, then to attack them on a sudden. With this design <lb/>
            he advanced towards Theagencs, throwing wild and fierce <lb/>
            glances around him, and discovering in his looks tho purpose <lb/>
            of his heart.</p>
          <p>They were surprised at the sudden appearance of a <lb/>
            stranger, almost naked, wounded, and with his face bloody. <lb/>
            Chariclea, startled and ashamed, retired into the inmost <lb/>
            part of the cave. Cnemon too drew a little back, know­ <lb/>
            ing Thermuthis, seeing him unexpectedly, and fearing <lb/>
            that he came there on no good account. But Theagenes <lb/>
            was more irritated than terrified, and presenting the point <lb/>
            of his sword, called out, “Stand where you are, or you <lb/>
            shall receive another wound; thus far I spare you, because <lb/>
            I know your face, and am not sure of your designs."- <lb/>
            Thermuthis stretched out his unarmed hands, and besought <lb/>
            his compassion; forced, notwithstanding his rugged temper, <lb/>
            from the circumstance he was in, to become a suppliant. <lb/>
            He called on Cnemon for assistance, and said be deserved <lb/>
            help from him, having never injured him ; having lived with <lb/>
            him as a comrade, and coming now as a friend. Cnemon <lb/>
            was moved by his entreaties; raised hint from tho knees of <lb/>
            Theagenes which he had embraced, and eagerly inquired <lb/>
            where was Thyamis. The latter related all he knew—how <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            his leader had attacked the enemy; how he had rushed into <lb/>
            the midst of the battle, sparing neither his foes nor himself; <lb/>
            the slaughter he made of them ; and the protection which <lb/>
            the proclamation to take him alive afforded him. He men­ <lb/>
            tioned his own wound and escape, but knew nothing of his <lb/>
            captain's fate; and was come here in search of Thisbe. <lb/>
            They inquired how he became so interested about Thisbe; <lb/>
            and how she came into his possession. He told them every­ <lb/>
            thing : how he had taken her from a merchant; how he fell <lb/>
            violently in love with her, and had concealed her some time <lb/>
            in his tent, and at the approach of the attacking party had <lb/>
            placed her in the cave where he now saw her slain; that he <lb/>
            was perfectly ignorant of the authors of her death, but <lb/>
            would most gladly find them out if he could, and ascertain <lb/>
            their motive.</p>
          <p>Cnemon, eager to free himself from suspicion, told him <lb/>
            it was certainly Thyamis who slew her; and shewed him <lb/>
            the sword which was found beside her; which, when Ther. <lb/>
            muthis saw, still reeking with blood, and warm from the <lb/>
            wound, and knew it to have belonged to Thyamis, he <lb/>
            uttered a deep groan, still more perplexed how to account <lb/>
            for the accident, and in dumb gloomy astonishment moved <lb/>
            towards the mouth of the cave. Here throwing himself <lb/>
            upon the bosom of the deceased, he embraced the body, and <lb/>
            repeating nothing but the name of Thisbe, fainter by de­ <lb/>
            grees and fainter, oppressed with grief and fatigue, sunk at <lb/>
            last into a sleep.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the company in the cave began now to <lb/>
            consult what steps it was proper for them to pursue. But <lb/>
            the multitude of their past calamities, the pressure of the <lb/>
            present misfortunes, and the uncertainty of what might <lb/>
            happen to them, obscured the light, and weakened the <lb/>
            force, of their reason. Each looked at the other, expecting <lb/>
            nim to say something; and being disappointed, turned his <lb/>
            ryes to the ground; and raising them again, sighed, lighten­ <lb/>
            ing a little his grief by this expression of it. At length <lb/>
            Cnemon sat down on the ground ; Theagenes threw himself <lb/>
            on a rock, and Chariclea reclined upon him. In this pos­ <lb/>
            ture they a long time resisted the attacks of sleep, desirous, <lb/>
            if they could, to devise some scheme of action; but, over­ <lb/>
            come at last with grief and fatigue, they unwillingly yielded <lb/>
            to the law of nature, and fell into a sweet slumber from <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            the very excess of sorrow. Thus is the intelligent soul <lb/>
            obliged sometimes to sympathise with the affections of the <lb/>
            body.</p>
          <p>When sleep had for a little while just weighed their eye­ <lb/>
            lids down, the following vision appeared to Chariclea. A <lb/>
            man with his hair in disorder, a downcast look, and bloody <lb/>
            hands, seemed to come and thrust out her right eye with a <lb/>
            sword. She instantly cried out, and called upon Theagenes. <lb/>
            He was soon awakened, and felt for her uneasiness, though <lb/>
            it was only in a dream. She lifted her hand to her face, as <lb/>
            if in search of the part she had lost, and then exclaimed, <lb/>
            " It was a dream ; my eye is safe !"—" I am glad," replied <lb/>
            Theagenes, " that those bright sunbeams are uninjured. <lb/>
            But what has ailed you? how came you so terrified?"— <lb/>
            " A savage and violent man," says she, not fearing even <lb/>
            your valour, attacked me with a sword as I lay at your feet; <lb/>
            and, as I thought, deprived me of my right eye ; and would <lb/>
            that it had been a reality and not a vision!"—" Now Heaven <lb/>
            forefend! why do you make so shocking a wish?”—"Be­ <lb/>
            cause I would much rather lose one of my eyes than be under <lb/>
            apprehensions for you ; for I greatly fear that the dream <lb/>
            regards you, whom I esteem as my eyes, my soul, my all.”— <lb/>
            “Cease,” called out Cnemon (who had heard all that had <lb/>
            passed, having been awakened by the first exclamation of <lb/>
            Chariclea), " for I think the vision has another interpre­ <lb/>
            tation. Had you any parents living when you left Greece?" <lb/>
            —“ I had," she replied.—“ Believe then now that your <lb/>
            father is dead. I form my conjecture from hence: Our <lb/>
            parents are the authors of our being; therefore they may <lb/>
            properly enough in a dream be shadowed out under the <lb/>
            similitude of eyes, the organs of light, which convey to us <lb/>
            things visible."</p>
          <p>It The loss of my father," replied Chariclea, “would be a <lb/>
            heavy blow; but let even your interpretation be the true <lb/>
            one, rather mine. I consent to pass for a false prophet!" <lb/>
            —“ Be it so," replied Cnemon; " but we are indeed dream­ <lb/>
            ing, while we are examining fancies and visions, and forget <lb/>
            to apply ourselves to our real business, especially while the <lb/>
            absence of the Egyptian (meaning Thermuthis), who is <lb/>
            employed in lamenting his deceased love, gives us an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity."—" 0 Cnemon," said Theagenes, “ since some god <lb/>
            has joined you to us, and made you a partaker in our cala­ <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            mities, do you advise us what to do, for you are acquainted <lb/>
            with the country and language; and we, oppressed with a <lb/>
            greater weight of misfortunes, are less fit for counsel."</p>
          <p>“ Which of us has the greater load of misfortunes to <lb/>
            struggle with, is by no means clear," said Cnemon. "I <lb/>
            have iny full share of them; but, however, as I am the elder, <lb/>
            and you command me to speak, I will obey you. The <lb/>
            island where we are, you see, is desolate, and contains none <lb/>
            but ourselves. Of gold, silver, and precious garments, <lb/>
            plundered from you and others, and heaped together by the <lb/>
            pirates, there is plenty; but of food and other necessaries, <lb/>
            it is totally destitute. If we stay here, we are in danger of <lb/>
            perishing by famine, or of being destroyed by some of the <lb/>
            invaders, or by the buccaneers, if, knowing of the treasures <lb/>
            which are left here, they return again in search of them. <lb/>
            There will then be no escape; either we shall perish, or be <lb/>
            exposed to their violence and insults. They are always <lb/>
            a faithless race, and will now be more disorderly and dread­ <lb/>
            ful, having lost their chief. We must fly, therefore, from <lb/>
            this place, as from a snare and a prison, sending Thermuthis <lb/>
            away first, if we can, under pretext of inquiring after <lb/>
            Thyamis, for we shall be more at liberty to consult and act <lb/>
            by ourselves. It is prudent, too, to remove from us a man <lb/>
            of an unconstant temper, of savage manners, and who, <lb/>
            besides, suspects us on account of the death of Thisbe, and <lb/>
            probably only waits for an opportunity to commit some <lb/>
            violence against us."</p>
          <p>The advice of Cnemon was approved of; and they deter­ <lb/>
            mined to follow it; and moving towards the mouth of the <lb/>
            cave, the day now beginning to dawn, they roused Ther­ <lb/>
            muthis, who was still sunk in sleep; and telling him as <lb/>
            much as they thought proper of their design, easily per­ <lb/>
            suaded a fickle-minded man. They then took the body of <lb/>
            Thisbe, drew it into a hollow of the rock, covered it as well <lb/>
            as they could with ashes from the tents, and performed <lb/>
            what funeral rites the time and place would admit of, sup­ <lb/>
            plying what was deficient by tears and lamentations.</p>
          <p>They next proceeded to send out Thermuthis on the <lb/>
            expedition they had projected for him. He set out, but <lb/>
            Boon returned, declaring he would not go alone, nor expose <lb/>
            himself to the danger of so perilous a search, unless Cnemon <lb/>
            would bear him company. Theagenes, observing that this <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            proposal was by no means agreeable to Cnemon, who <lb/>
            befrayed evident marks of fear and apprehension when <lb/>
            informed of it, said to him, " You are valiant in council, <lb/>
            Cnemon, but a laggard in action; you have shown this more <lb/>
            than once; pluck up your spirits, and prove yourself a man. <lb/>
            It is necessary that this fellow should have no suspicion, at <lb/>
            present, of our design to leave him. Seem to agree, there­ <lb/>
            fore, to what he proposes, and go with him at first; for <lb/>
            there is no danger to be apprehended from an unarmed <lb/>
            man, especially by you who are armed. You may take <lb/>
            your opportunity, and leave him privately, and come to us <lb/>
            at some place which we shall fix upon; and we will, if you <lb/>
            please, mention some neighbouring town, if you know any, <lb/>
            where the inhabitants are a little civilized."</p>
          <p>Cnemon agreed to this, and named Chemmis, a rich and <lb/>
            populous place, situated on a rising ground on the banks of <lb/>
            the Nile, by way of defence against the incursions of the <lb/>
            pirates, about one hundred furlongs distant from the lake <lb/>
            directly south. “ I fear," said Theagenes, " that Chariclea <lb/>
            will find some difficulty in getting thither, as she is unused <lb/>
            to walking; however, we will attempt it, and pretend that <lb/>
            we are beggars who seek our living by showing juggling <lb/>
            tricks."</p>
          <p>" Truly," said Cnemon, " your faces are sufficiently dis­ <lb/>
            figured for such a business, particularly Chariclea's, who <lb/>
            has just lost an eye; after all, though, I fear you will rather <lb/>
            appear guests for the table than petitioners for scraps at <lb/>
            the door.”*—This sally was received with a forced and <lb/>
            languid smile, which played only on the lips. They then <lb/>
            prepared to depart, swearing never to desert each other, <lb/>
            and calling the gods to witness it.</p>
          <p>Cnemon and Thermuthis set out early in the morning; <lb/>
            and, crossing the lake, took their way through a thick and <lb/>
            difficult wood. Thermuthis went first, at the persuasion of <note type="footnote"> * Literally, persons who make request for valuable gifts, such as <lb/>
            swords and tripods, rather than mendicants who beg for broken <lb/>
            victuals. Cnemon must mean to say that nature had written " gen­ <lb/>
            tleman and gentlewoman It too plainly upon their faces for them to <lb/>
            pass current as genuine vagrants. The line quoted is in the Odyssey, <lb/>

             <pb n="44"/>
            Cnemon, on the pretext that, as he was acquainted with the <lb/>
            country, be was better qualified to lead; in reality, that the <lb/>
            other might more easily find an opportunity of deserting <lb/>
            him. They met with some flocks in their way; and the <lb/>
            shepherds fled, at their approach, into the thickest of the <lb/>
            wood. They seized a ram, roasted him at a fire the shep­ <lb/>
            herds had lighted, and hardly staying till it was sufficiently <lb/>
            dressed, devoured the flesh with eagerness. Hunger pressed <lb/>
            them; they fell upon it like wolves; swallowed whole pieces, <lb/>
            just warmed through, and still dropping with blood. When <lb/>
            they had satisfied their hunger, and allayed their thirst <lb/>
            with milk, they pursued their way. Evening now ap­ <lb/>
            proached, and they were ascending a hill under which was <lb/>
            situated a town, where Thermuthis said it was very probable <lb/>
            that Thyamis was either detained a captive or had been <lb/>
            slain. Here Cnemon pretended that he felt great pain; <lb/>
            that his stomach was exceedingly disordered by his inordi­ <lb/>
            nate repast of meat and drink, and that he must retire to <lb/>
            ease it. This he did two or three times, that his com­ <lb/>
            panion might suspect nothing, and complained that it was <lb/>
            with great difficulty he could follow him. When he had <lb/>
            accustomed the Egyptian to his staying behind, he took an <lb/>
            opportunity at last to let him go on forwards farther than <lb/>
            usual; and then, turning suddenly back, he ran down the <lb/>
            hill as fast as he could into the thickest part of the bushes. <lb/>
            Thermuthis, when he had arrived at the summit, sat himself <lb/>
            down on a rock, expecting the approach of night, which <lb/>
            they had agreed to wait for before they entered into the <lb/>
            town to inquire after Thyamis. He looked about for his <lb/>
            companion, having no good designs against him, for he was <lb/>
            still persuaded that he had slain Thisbe, and was consider. <lb/>
            ing how he might serve him in the same manner; proposing <lb/>
            afterwards to attack Theagenes. But when Cnemon ap­ <lb/>
            peared nowhere, and night advanced, he fell asleep-a. <lb/>
            deadly* and last sleep it proved to him, for an asp, which <lb/>
            had lain concealed in a thicket, bit him, and put a fitting <lb/>
            end to his life.</p>
          <p>But Cnemon, after be had left Thermuthis, stopped not in <lb/>
            his flight till the darkness of the night obliged him to make <lb/>
            a halt. He then endeavoured to conceal himself by lying <lb/>
            down and covering himself as well as he could with leaves. <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χάλκέον τινα καὶπύμαπματον ΰπνον</foreign>.-Homer. Il. XI 241. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            Here he passed a restless and almost sleepless night, taking <lb/>
            every noise, every gust of wind, and motion of a leaf, for <lb/>
            Thermuthis. If at any time he dropped into a slumber, he <lb/>
            thought he was flecing;* and looking behind, imagined he <lb/>
            saw him pursuing, who was now unable to follow him; till at <lb/>
            last he resisted all approaches of sleep, his dreams becoming <lb/>
            more dreadful to him than even his waking apprehensions.</p>
          <p>He was uneasy at the duration of the night, which <lb/>
            appeared to him the longest he hoover spent. At length, <lb/>
            to his great joy, day appeared. He † then proceeded to cut <lb/>
            his hair short, which he had suffered to grow, in imitation <lb/>
            of, and to recommend himself to, his piratical companions, <lb/>
            for the pirates, willing to render themselves as formidable <lb/>
            as they can, among other things, cherish long hair, which <lb/>
            they suffer to grow down their foreheads, and play over <lb/>
            their shoulders, well knowing that flowing locks, as they <lb/>
            make the lover more amiable, so they render the warrior <lb/>
            more terrible. When Cnemon, therefore, had shaped his <lb/>
            hair into the common form, he proceeded to Chemmis, <lb/>
            where he had appointed to meet Theagenes. As he drew <lb/>
            near the Nile, and was, preparing to pass over it to Chemmis, <lb/>
            he perceived an old man wandering upon its banks, walking <lb/>
            several times up and down the stream, as if he were com­ <lb/>
            municating his cares to the river. His locks were as white <lb/>
            as snow, and shaped like those of a priest; his beard flowing <lb/>
            and venerable; his habit Grecian. Cnemon stopped a little ; <lb/>
            but when the old man passed by many times, seemingly <lb/>
            unconscious that any one was near (so entirely was he <lb/>
            immersed in care and meditation), he placed himself before <lb/>
            him, and, in the Grecian manner of salutation, bid him be <lb/>
            of good cheery The other replied, his fortunes were such <note type="footnote"> *“ Like one, who on a lonesome road <lb/>

            that good cheer was out of the question. Cnemon, sur­ <lb/>
            prised, asked: “ Are you a stranger from Greece, or from <lb/>
            whence ?”—“Iam neither a Grecian nor a stranger,”said <lb/>
            he,“but anEgyptian? of this country.”—“Why, then, have <lb/>
            you a Grecian dress ?”—“My misfortunes,”says he, " have <lb/>
            put me into thissplendid habit. it The other, wondering <lb/>
            how misfortunes could improve a man's appearance, and <lb/>
            seeming desirous to be informed—“ You carry mo into a <lb/>

            of evils, the recital of which would oppress you. But <lb/>
            whence do you come, O young man, and whither are you <lb/>
            going? and how come I to hear the Greek tongue in <lb/>
            Egypt ?”—“It is a little unreasonable in you," replied <lb/>
            Cnemon, " to ask these questions of me, you who will tell <lb/>
            nothing about yourself, though I made the first inquiries." <lb/>
            —“ I admit it," said the other; " but do not be offended. <lb/>
            You seem to be a Greek, and to have yourself undergone <lb/>
            some transformation from the hand of fortune. You are <lb/>
            desirous to hear my adventures; I am no less so to relate <lb/>
            them. Probably I had told them to these reeds, as the <lb/>
            table† goes, if I had not met with you. But let us leave <lb/>
            the Nile and its banks; for a situation exposed to the meri­ <lb/>
            dian sun is not a proper place for a long narration. If you <lb/>
            have no urgent business which hinders you, let us go to the <lb/>
            town which you see opposite to us. I will entertain younot <lb/>
            in my own house, but in that of a good man who received me <lb/>

            town to wait for some friends of mine, whom I had <lb/>
            appointed to meet there." Getting, therefore, into a boat, <lb/>

            “ Will you then relate,”said Cnemon, " when and how you <lb/>
            encountered this grievous war of woe ?”—“By-and-bye, he <lb/>
            replied; “ but let us now attend to our craving stomach; <lb/>
            which, because it considers itself of more consequence than <lb/>
            any other organ, is called by Homer destructive. And first, <lb/>
            as is the custom of the Egyptian sages, let us make a liba­ <lb/>
            tion to the gods. Nothing shall make me omit this; nor <lb/>
            shall grief ever so entirely possess my mind, as to render <lb/>
            me forgetful of what I owe to heaven." With this he <lb/>
            poured pure water out of the vase, and said, " I make this <lb/>
            libation to the gods of this country, and those of Greece; <lb/>
            to the and Apollo, and also to Theagenes and Chariclea, <lb/>
            the good and beautiful, since I reckon them also among the <lb/>
            gods:”and then he wept, as if he were making another <lb/>
            libation to them with his tears. Cnemon, greatly struck at <lb/>
            what he heard, viewed the old man from head to foot, and <lb/>
            exclaimed, " What do you say ? Are Theagenes and Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea really your children?”—“They are my children," <lb/>
            replied the stranger, but born to me without a mother. <lb/>
            Fortune, by the permission of the gods, gave them to me ; <lb/>
            I brought them forth with the travail of my soul. My great <lb/>
            inclination towards them supplied the place of nature ; and <lb/>
            I have been esteemed by them, and called their father. But <lb/>
            tell me, how came you acquainted with them ?"—" I am not <lb/>
            only acquainted with them,”said Cnemon, " but can assure <lb/>
            you that they are alive and well.“—” 0 Apollo, and all the <lb/>
            gods !" he exclaimed, " where are they ? Tell me, I beseech <lb/>
            you; and you will be my preserver and equal to the gods !" <lb/>
            —“ But what shall be my reward ?" replied the other.—“ At <lb/>
            present that of obliging me; no mean reward to a wise <lb/>
            man: I know many who have laid up this as a treasure in <lb/>
            their hearts. But if we arrive in my country, which, if I <lb/>
            may believe the tokens of the gods, will ere long be, your <lb/>
            utmost desires shall be satisfied with wealth." <lb/>
            "You promise me," said Cnemon, "things uncertain and <lb/>
            future, when you have it in your power to reward me im­ <lb/>
            mediately.”—“Show me anything I can now do for you," <lb/>
            said the old man, " for I would willingly part even with a <lb/>
            limb to satisfy you.”—“ Your limbs need be in no danger,” <note type="footnote">*....“Hunger bath a cry which never man <lb/>

            replied the Grecian; “I shall be satisfied if you will relate <lb/>
            to me from whence these strangers come, who were their <lb/>
            parents, how they were brought here, and what have been <lb/>
            their adventures.”—“ You shall have a treat," replied the <lb/>
            old man; " so great as to be second to none other, not even <lb/>
            if you should obtain all earthly treasures. But let us now <lb/>
            take a little food ; for my narration and your listening will <lb/>
            take up a considerable time."</p>
          <p>When they had eaten, therefore, some nuts and figs, and <lb/>
            fresh-gathered dates, and such other things as the old man <lb/>
            was used to feed upon (for he never deprived any animal of <lb/>
            life for his own nourishment), he drank a little water, and <lb/>
            Cnemon some wine; and, after a short pause, the latter <lb/>
            said: " You know, 0 father, that Bacchus delights in con­ <lb/>
            vivial conversations and stories ; and as I am now under his <lb/>
            influence, I am very desirous of hearing some, and I claim <lb/>
            from you my promised reward: it is time to bring your <lb/>
            piece upon the stage, as the saying goes.”—“ You shall be <lb/>
            satisfied,”replied the stranger: "but I wish tho good <lb/>
            Nausieles were here, who has often earnestly desired to hear <lb/>
            this detail from me, and as often, on some pretext or other, <lb/>
            has been put off.”—At the name of Nausicles, Cnemon <lb/>
            asked where he was. " He is gone a hunting," replied the <lb/>
            other. — And after what kind of game Why, not <lb/>
            indeed of wild beasts, but of men as savage as they, who are <lb/>
            called buccaneers, who live by robbery, who are very diffi­ <lb/>

            " What offence have they given him “They have taken <lb/>
            his mistress from him, an Athenian girl, whom he called <lb/>
            Thisbe.”—“ Ah !" said Cnemon, in a tone of surprise, and <lb/>
            immediately stopped, as if checking himself.—“ What ails <lb/>
            you ?" said the old man.—The other, evading the question, <lb/>
            proceeded, “ I wonder with what forces he means to attack <lb/>
            them ?”—“ Oroondates, viceroy of Egypt, under the Great <lb/>
            King, has appointed Mitranes commandant of this town; <lb/>
            Nausicles, by means of a large sum of money, has pre­ <lb/>
            vailed upon him to march with a body of horse and foot <lb/>
            against them ; for he is exceedingly annoyed at the loss of <lb/>
            this Grecian girl; not only because he liked her himself, <lb/>
            and because she was well skilled in music; but because he <lb/>
            was going to take her with him to the king of Ethiopia, by <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            way of attendant upon the queen, as he said, and to amuse her <lb/>
            after the Grecian fashion. Being deprived, therefore, as he <lb/>
            supposes, by her loss, of a great reward which he expected <lb/>
            for her, he is using his utmost efforts to recover her. I en­ <lb/>
            couraged him too to this expedition, thinking it possible he <lb/>
            might find and recover In,. children also." “Enough of buc­ <lb/>
            cancers, and viceroys, and kings," cried outCnemon, im­ <lb/>
            patiently ; “your discourse is wandering from the point I <lb/>
            aim at. This episode* has nothing to do with the main plot; <lb/>
            come back to the performance of your promise; you are like <lb/>
            the Phariun Proteus;† not turning indeed into false and <lb/>
            fleeting shapes, but trying to slip away from me.” —“Be satis­ <lb/>
            fied," said the old man,“you shall know all. I will explain to <lb/>
            you first what relates to myself, shortly, and without reserve ; <lb/>
            which will be a proper introduction to that which is to follow.</p>
          <p>" I am a citizen of Memphis. The name of my father was <lb/>
            Calasiris, as is likewise mine. Though now a wanderer, I <lb/>
            was not long ago a high priest. I had a wife, but have now <lb/>
            lost her; after her death I lived for some time quietly, <lb/>
            delighting myself with two sons whom she had left me. But <lb/>
            in a few years, the fated revolution of the heavenly bodies <lb/>
            altered every thing ; the eye of Saturn scowled upon my <lb/>
            family, and portended a change in my fortunes for the <lb/>
            worse. I had skill enough to foresee the ills which threatened <lb/>
            me, but not to avoid them ; for no foresight can enable us <lb/>
            to escape the immutable decrees of fate: it is, however, an <lb/>
            advantage, to have some foreknowledge of them, as it blunts <lb/>
            the violence of the stroke. Unexpected misfortunes,my <lb/>
            Ion, are intolerable; those which are foreseen are more <lb/>
            easily borne : the mind is confused and disarmed by sudden <lb/>
            fear; custom and reason strengthen it. My calamities <lb/>
            began in this manner:</p>
          <p>" A Thracian woman, in the bloom of youth and in beauty <lb/>
            second only to Chariclea, whose name was Rhodope, unfor­ <lb/>
            tunately for those who became acquainted with her, travelled <lb/>
            through Egypt. In her progress: she came in ‘ revel-rout <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="51"/>
              to Memphis, with great luxury and pomp of attendance, <lb/>
              and adorned with every grace, and exercising all the arts of <lb/>
              love. It was almost impossible to see her, and not fall <lb/>
              into her snares; such irresistible witchery accompanied the <lb/>
              eyes of this fair. harlot. Shefrequently came into the <lb/>
              temple of Isis, where I officiated as high priest. She wor­ <lb/>
              shipped the goddess with sacrifices and costly offerings. I <lb/>
              am ashamed to proceed; yet I will not conceal the truth. <lb/>
              The frequent sight of her overcame mo at last, in spite of <lb/>
              the command I had long been accustomed to maintain over <lb/>
              my passions. I struggled long against my bodily eyes and <lb/>
              the eyes of my fancy, but in vain; I yielded at last, and <lb/>
              sank under the dominion of love. I perceived that the <lb/>
              arrival of this woman was to be the beginning of those misfor­ <lb/>
              tunes which the heavens foretold to me ; and that my evil <lb/>
              genius was to make her one of the principal instruments of <lb/>
              them. I determined, however, to do nothing to disgrace <lb/>
              that office of priesthood which had descended to me from <lb/>
              my ancestors, nor to profane the altars and temples of the <lb/>
              gods: and as to the transgression which my evil stars had <lb/>
              determined I should fall into, not in act, indeed (heaven <lb/>
              forbid!) but in desire; I constituted reason my judge, and <lb/>
              made her impose the penalty of exile from my native land, <lb/>
              yielding to the necessity of fate, submitting to its decrees, <lb/>
              and flying from the ill-omened Rhodope. For I will own to <lb/>
              you, O stranger! that I was afraid, lest, under the present <lb/>
              baleful influence of the constellations, I might be tempted <lb/>
              to do something unbecoming my character. Another, and a <lb/>
              principal reason for my absenting myself, was, on account of <lb/>
              my children ; for my skill in divination shewed me that they <lb/>
              were in a short time to contend with each other in arms.</p>
          <p>" Snatching myself away, therefore, from a spectacle so <lb/>
            dreadful to a father's eyes (sufficient to turn aside the <lb/>
            aspect of the sun, and make him hide his beams), I de­ <lb/>
            parted from my country, from my house, and family, making <lb/>
            no one acquainted with the course I intended to take, but <lb/>
            pretending that I was going to Egyptian Thebes, to see my <lb/>
            eldest son Thyamis, who was there on a visit to his grand­ <note type="footnote"> * “Thewell-favoured harlot, the mistressof witchcrafts, that sclleth <lb/>

            father.”—Cnemon started again at the name of Thyamia; <lb/>
            but restrained himself, and was silent, desirous to hear the <lb/>
            sequel. The old man, after observing­</p>
          <p>" I pass over the intermediate part of my journey, for it <lb/>
            has no relation to what you desire to know,” thus pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded : " But having heard that there was a famous city in <lb/>
            Greece, called Delphi, sacred to Apollo, abounding in tem­ <lb/>
            ples, the resort of wise men, retired, and free from popular <lb/>
            tumults; thither I bent my steps, thinking that a city des­ <lb/>
            tined for sacred rites was a proper retreat for one of my <lb/>
            profession. I sailed through the Crissœau gulf, and land­ <lb/>
            ing nt Cirrha, proceeded to the city: when 1 entered it, a <lb/>
            voice, no doubt divine, sounded in my cars ; and as in other <lb/>
            respects this place seemed a fit habitation for a superior <lb/>
            race, so particularly on account of its situation. The moun­ <lb/>
            tain Parnassus hangs over it, as a kind of natural fortifi­ <lb/>
            cation and citadel, stretching out its sides, and receiving tho <lb/>
            city into its bosom.” “ Your description is most graphic, <lb/>
            cried out Cnemon, “and seems really made under the in­ <lb/>
            fluence of the Pythic inspiration; for in this manner I <lb/>
            remember well my father described Delphi, when he returned <lb/>
            from the council of the Amphictyona, to which the city of <lb/>
            Athens had deputed him as sacred secretary.”*—1“ You are <lb/>
            an Athenian then, my son ?"—" Yes.”—“Your name?”— <lb/>
            Cnemon.”—“What have been your fortunes?" -“You shall <lb/>
            hear by-and-bye. Now however continue your own narra­ <lb/>
            tion.”—“ I will,” replied the old man.</p>
          <p>" I ascended into the place, I admired the city of race­ <lb/>
            courses, of market-places, and of fountains, especially the <lb/>
            famed one of Castalia, with the water of which I sprinkled <lb/>
            myself, and hastened to the temple; for the thronging of <lb/>
            the multitude, which pressed towards it, seemed to announce <lb/>
            the time when the priestess was about to be under the <lb/>
            sacred impulse ;t and having worshipped and uttered a peti­ <lb/>
            tion for myself, I received the following oracle: <lb/>
            Thou from the fertile Nile, thy course dost bend,‡ <lb/>

            Stern fate thou fly’st, her strokes with courage bear; <lb/>
            Ere long of Egypt thou shalt have a sham.</p>
          <p>“ As soon as the priestess had pronounced this, I fell upon <lb/>
            my face, and besought the deity to be propitious to me in <lb/>
            everything. The crowd who surrounded the shrine, joined <lb/>
            in praising the deity for having deigned to answer me oil <lb/>
            my first entreaty ; they congratulated me, and paid me <lb/>
            great respect, saying, that I seemed to be the greatest <lb/>
            favourite with the deity who had appeared there since <lb/>
            Lycurgus,* a Spartan. They permitted me at my request <lb/>
            to inhabit the precinets of the temple, and passed a decree <lb/>
            that I should be maintained at the public expense. My <lb/>
            situation, in short, was a very agreeable one; I either <lb/>
            assisted at the ceremonies and sacrifices which were every <lb/>
            day performed and offered by strangers as well as natives, <lb/>
            or conversed with the philosophers, for many of this de­ <lb/>
            scription flocked to Delphi. The city t is in truth a <lb/>
            university, inspired by the deity who presides over inspi­ <lb/>
            ration and the muses. Various subjects were discussed; <lb/>
            sometimes the manner of our religious rites in Egypt, and <lb/>
            why certain animals were counted sacred more than others; <lb/>
            and the different histories which belonged to each. Another <lb/>
            inquired about the construction of the Pyramids and the <lb/>
            Cutacombs.‡ In short, there was nothing relative to Egypt <lb/>
            which they did not scrutinize into; for it is wonderful how <lb/>
            the Greeks listen to, and are delighted with, accounts of <lb/>
            that country. At length one among the more accomplished <lb/>
            of them touched upon the Nile, its fountains, and inun­ <lb/>

              the summer solstice, drive the clouds before them from the <lb/>
              northern into the southern parts, which are by this means <lb/>
              collected in the torrid zone, where their farther motion is <lb/>
              stopped by the extreme vehemence of the heat. They are <lb/>
              then condensed, and pressed by degrees, till they dissolve, <lb/>
              and fall in copious showers. These swell the river till it <lb/>
              disdains its banks, and, bursting over Egypt like a sea, fer­ <lb/>
              tilizes the plains it overflows. Its waters are very sweet to <lb/>
              drink, as they are furnished by the rains from heaven ; they <lb/>
              are not hot to the touch as they are higher up, but never­ <lb/>
              theless are tepid; they exhale no vapours like other rivers, <lb/>
              which they certainly would do, if (as some learned Grecians <lb/>
              suppose) their rise was owing to the melting of the snows.</p>
          <p>" While I was discoursing in this manner, one of the <lb/>
            priests of Apollo, whose name was Charicles, with whom I <lb/>
            had contracted some intimacy, said, I am pleased with what <lb/>
            you say, and agree with you entirely, for I have heard the <lb/>
            same account of this matter from the priests at the cata­ <lb/>
            racts of the Nile.-And have you been as far as there, said <lb/>
            I?—I have, he replied.-On what account?—On occasion <lb/>
            of some family misfortunes, which, however, at last became <lb/>
            the course of my happiness. When I expressed some sur­ <lb/>
            prize at this, “You would not wonder," said he, " if you <lb/>
            were to hear the whole matter as it happened; and you <lb/>
            may hear it whenever you please.—I should be very glad <lb/>
            to hear it at once, said I.—Attend then, said Charicles; <lb/>
            for I have long, and from an interested motive, wished for <lb/>
            an opportunity of relating my story to you:—and, dismiss­ <lb/>
            ing the general company, he began as follows:</p>
          <p>“ I had been married a considerable time without having <note type="footnote"> tesque DO ceremoniarum obliteraretur memoria, penitus operosis <lb/>

            children;• I wearied the gods with supplications; and <lb/>
            at last, in an advanced stage of life, I became the father of <lb/>
            a little daughter, but who was born, as the gods foretold, <lb/>
            not under auspicious destiny. She became marriageable, <lb/>
            and had many suitors. I married her to him whom I <lb/>
            thought most worthy of her; and on the very wedding night <lb/>
            she was burnt in her bed, her apartment having been set on <lb/>
            fire either by accident or lightning. The hymeneal song, <lb/>
            which was still resounding, was turned into a dirge: she was <lb/>
            carried from the marriage apartment to her grave; and the <lb/>
            torches, which had illuminated the nuptial procession, now <lb/>
            lighted the funeral pile.</p>
          <p>“ My evil genius added yet another calamity to this tra­ <lb/>
            gedy, and took from me the mother of my child, who sank <lb/>
            under her sorrows.</p>
          <p>" Such a series of misfortunes was almost too much for <lb/>
            me. It was with difficulty I abstained from laying violent <lb/>
            hands upon myself ; I had however strength of mind suffi­ <lb/>
            dent to refrain from an action which the teachers of religion <lb/>
            pronounce unlawful. But being unable to bear the solitude <lb/>
            and silence of my house, I left my country, for to deaden <lb/>
            memory by turning the eyes upon new objects is a great <lb/>
            palliative to grief. I wandered into various parts, and came <lb/>
            at last into your Egypt, and to Catadupa,† in order to visit the <lb/>
            cataracts of the Kile : this, my friend, was the occasion of my <lb/>
            coming into your country, which you inquired after. I must <lb/>
            now proceed to a digression, though it more properly forms <lb/>
            the principal reason of in entering at all into this narration.</p>
          <p>“ While I was wandering at leisure through the city, and <lb/>
            buying some things of the Greeks (for time having now <lb/>
            considerably alleviated my grief, I thought of returning into <lb/>
            my country), I was accosted by a middle-aged man, with the <lb/>
            complexion of an Æthiopian, but of a grave deportment, and <lb/>
            bearing marks of prudence in his aspect: he saluted me, <lb/>
            and in broken Greek said he wished to speak to me. I <lb/>
            readily consenting, he took me into a neighbouring temple, <note type="footnote"> * The reader will keep in mind that it is Charicles who speaks now <lb/>
            - to Calasiris ; otherwise, between the double narration going on at the <lb/>
            same time, of Calasiris to Cnemon, and of Charicles to Calasiris, he <lb/>

            and said: I saw you cheapening some Indian, Æthiopian, <lb/>
            and Egyptian roots and herbs; if you really have a desire to <lb/>
            buy some, I can furnish you.—I shall be very glad to see <lb/>
            them, I replied.—You must not beat me down too much, <lb/>
            said he.—Do not then be too exorbitant on your part, was <lb/>
            my answer.—With that he pulled a small pouch from a pocket <lb/>
            under his arm, and showed me some jewels of inestimable <lb/>
            value: there were pearls as big as nuts, perfectly round, and <lb/>
            of the purest white; emeralds and amethysts—the former as <lb/>
            green as the vernal corn, and shining with a kind of oily <lb/>
            lustre; the latter resembling the colour of the sea-beach, <lb/>
            when played upon by the shadows of an overhanging rock, <lb/>
            which impart to it a purple tinge.. The mingled brilliancy <lb/>
            of the whole collection astonished and delighted my eyes.</p>
          <p>" After having contemplated them for some time, I said, <lb/>
            You must seek some other purchaser; my whole fortune <lb/>
            would scarcely be sufficient to procure one of these gems.— <lb/>
            But if you cannot buy them, he replied, you may receive <lb/>
            them as a present.-Certainly! but why are you jesting <lb/>
            with me ?—I am not jesting with you, I am serious in what <lb/>
            I say ; and I swear to you by the deity whose shrine we <lb/>
            are before, that I will give you everything which I have <lb/>
            shown you, if, in addition to these, you will receive from my <lb/>
            hands a present far more precious than all which you behold. <lb/>
            —I could not help smiling: he asked the cause of it.- <lb/>
            Because it seems to me ridiculous, said It that when you <lb/>
            promise me gifts of such price, you should besides make me <lb/>
            expect a present still more valuable.—Nevertheless, believe <lb/>
            me, he replied, and swear to me that you will use my gift <lb/>
            well, and in the manner which I shall exact from you.—I <lb/>
            wondered and doubted, but at last swore to him, allured by <lb/>
            the hopes of such treasures. When I had taken such an <lb/>
            oath as he required, he conducted me to his house, and <lb/>
            showed me a girl of wonderful and more than mortal beauty : <lb/>
            He affirmed she was but seven years old; but she appeared <lb/>
            to me to be almost of a marriageable age, so much aid her <lb/>
            uncommon beauty seem to add even to her stature. I stood <lb/>
            for some time motionless, ignorant of what was to follow, <lb/>
            and ravished with the sight before me; when my conductor <lb/>
            thus addressed me:</p>
          <p>“ The child whom you behold, 0 stranger, was exposed, <note type="footnote"> • Oiv<foreign xml:lang="grc">οπα πόντον</foreign>.-Il. i. 350. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            when an infant, by her mother, and left at the mercy of <lb/>
            fortune, for a reason which you shall hear by-and-bye. It <lb/>
            happened luckily that I found, and took her up; for I could <lb/>
            not allow myself to desert in its danger a soul which had <lb/>
            once entered a human body: in so doing I should have trans­ <lb/>
            gressed the precepts of our Gymnosophists,* of whom I had <lb/>
            been privileged to be a disciple omething, too, uncommon <lb/>
            and divine, seemed to beam from the eyes of the infant, <lb/>
            which were cast upon me with sparkling yet engaging lustre. <lb/>
            There was exposed with her this profusion of jewels which I <lb/>
            have shown you. There was a silken fillet, on which was <lb/>
            written some account of the child, in letters of her native <lb/>
            country; her mother, I suppose, taking care to place these <lb/>
            explanations with her. When I had read it, and knew from <lb/>
            whence and whose the infant was, I took her to a farm at a <lb/>
            distance from the city, and placed her in the hands of shep­ <lb/>
            herds to be nourished, enjoining them to keep her as private <lb/>
            as possible. I myself kept the jewels which were exposed <lb/>
            with her, lest they might tempt any one to destroy the child. <lb/>
            The whole transaction remained for a while a secret; but, in <lb/>
            process of time, as she grew up and increased more than <lb/>
            commonly in stature and in beauty (so much so, indeed, that <lb/>
            her charms would not have been concealed even in the bowels <lb/>
            of the earth), fearing some discovery to her prejudice, and <lb/>
            that It too, might come into some trouble about her: I pro­ <lb/>
            cured myself to be sent ambassador into Egypt. I came here: <lb/>
            I brought the girl with me, being very desirous of placing her <lb/>
            in some secure situation. The viceroy of this country has <lb/>
            appointed to give me audience to-day : meanwhile I deliver <lb/>
            up to you, and to the gods, the disposers of all events, this <lb/>
            child; trusting that you will observe the conditions you <lb/>
            have sworn to; that you will preserve her free, as you have <lb/>
            received her, and marry her to a free man. I confide in <lb/>
            your performing all you have promised; not depending <lb/>
            alone on your oaths, but on your disposition and general <lb/>
            conduct, which 1 have observed for the many days which <lb/>
            you have spent in this city, and which I see to be truly <lb/>
            worthy of Greece, that renowned country to which you owe <lb/>
            your birth. This is all I can say to you at present, as the <lb/>
            business of my embassy calls me; but, if you will meet <note type="footnote"> See Anthon's Lempriere’s Classical Diet. </note> <lb/>

            me at the temple of Isis to-morrow, you shall have a more <lb/>
            particular and exact account of your charge.</p>
          <p>" I did as I was desired. I took the girl home with me <lb/>
            to my house: I treated her with respect and tenderness, <lb/>
            giving thanks to the gods for the event; and from that time <lb/>
            calling and esteeming her as my daughter. The next morn­ <lb/>
            ing I hastened to the temple of Isis, where the stranger had <lb/>
            appointed me; and after I had walked about and waited <lb/>
            a considerable time, and saw nothing of him, I went to the <lb/>
            palace of the viceroy, and inquired if any one bad seen the <lb/>
            Æthiopian ambassador. I was there told that he had left <lb/>
            the city, or rather had been driven out of it, the evening <lb/>
            before,-the viceroy threatening him with death if he did <lb/>
            not immediately quit the province. When I inquired into <lb/>
            the cause of so sudden a proceeding, I learned that he had, <lb/>
            with some haughtiness, forbidden the governor to meddle <lb/>
            with the emerald mines, which he claimed as belonging ex­ <lb/>
            clusively to Æthiopia. I returned home vexed and disap­ <lb/>
            pointed, as I was by this accident prevented from knowing <lb/>
            the condition, the country, and parents of the child."</p>
          <p>“I am vexed, too, as much as he was," said Cnemon, " for <lb/>
            my curiosity on these subjects is nearly as great; but, per­ <lb/>
            haps, it may be satisfied in the progress of your narration." <lb/>
            “Possibly it may,” replied Calasiris; "but now, if you please, <lb/>
            let Charicles proceed with his own story, which he thus con­ <lb/>
            tinued :—</p>
          <p>" When I arrived at my house, the child came out to <lb/>
            meet me. She could not speak to me, knowing nothing of <lb/>
            Greek; but she saluted me with her hand, and the sight of <lb/>
            her began to console me for my disappointment. 1 saw, <lb/>
            with admiration, that, as a generous race of hounds fawn <lb/>
            upon those who notice them; so she seemed to have a <lb/>
            strong sense of my kindness for her, and to consider me in <lb/>
            the light of a father. I determined to stay no longer at <lb/>
            Caladupa, lest some envious deity should deprive me of <lb/>
            my second daughter. Embarking, therefore, on the Nile, <lb/>
            I reached the sea, got on board a ship, and arrived in <lb/>
            Greece. This child is now with me: I have given her my <lb/>
            name, and all my cares are centred in her. Her improve­ <note type="footnote"> * “ Where, perhaps, some beauty lies, <lb/>
            The cynosure of neighbouring eyes.”—Milton. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            ments exceed my warmest wishes. She has learned my <lb/>
            language with surprising quickness: she has grown up to <lb/>
            perfection like a flourishing plant. Her beauty is so trans­ <lb/>
            cendent as to attract every eye upon her, both Grecian and <lb/>
            foreign. Wherever she appears-in the temple, in the <lb/>
            course, or in the market-place—she draws to her the looks <lb/>
            and thoughts of all, like the model statue of some goddess. <lb/>
            Yet, with all this, she is the cause of great uneasiness to <lb/>
            me: she* obstinately refuses to marry, determines to lead <lb/>
            a life of celibacy, consecrates herself to Diana, and spends <lb/>
            most of her leisure hours in the chase, and with her bow. <lb/>
            This is a severe disappointment to me, for I wished to give <lb/>
            her to my sister's son, an accomplished and graceful young <lb/>
            man; but my wishes are frustrated by this preposterous <lb/>
            fancy of hers. Neither entreaties, nor promises, nor reason­ <lb/>
            ing, can work upon her; and, what is most vexatious, she <lb/>
            wounds me, as they say, with a shaft drawn from my own <lb/>
            bow, and employs the eloquence which I have taught her in <lb/>
            magnifying the way of life she has chosen. She is inex­ <lb/>
            haustible in the praises of virginity; places it next the life <lb/>
            of the gods-pure, unmixed, uncorrupt. She is equally <lb/>
            skilful in depreciating love, and Venus, and marriage. I <lb/>
            implore your assistance in this matter; for which reason <lb/>
            I was glad to seize the opportunity you gave me, and have <lb/>
            troubled you with a long story. Do not desert me on this <lb/>
            occasion, my good Calasiris, but employ the wisdom you are <lb/>
            master of, or even any charm you may know; persuade her <lb/>
            by words, or work upon her by incantations, to leave this <lb/>
            unnatural course, and to feel that she is born a woman : <lb/>
            you can, I know, do this if you will. She is not averse to <lb/>
            the conversation of men; she has been used to their com­ <lb/>
            any from her childhood. She lives, too, very near you, <lb/>
            here within the precincts of the temple. Condescend, I <lb/>
            beseech, to hear me, and grant what I desire. Suffer me <lb/>
            not to spend a melancholy and lonely old age, without hopes <lb/>
            of having my family continued; I entreat you by Apollo, <lb/>
            and your country's gods."</p>
          <p>"I was moved by his supplications, Cnemon. I could <lb/>
            scarcely refrain from tears: his own flowed in great abun­ <note type="footnote"> * “ <unclear>Solâ</unclear> contenta <unclear>Dianâ</unclear>, <lb/>

            dance. I promised, in short, to use my utmost skill in <lb/>
            attempting what he desired. We were still talking, when a <lb/>
            messenger arrived in haste, and told us that the head of the <lb/>
            Ænianian embassy was at the door, and extremely impa­ <lb/>
            tient for the priest to appear, and begin the sacred rites. <lb/>
            When I inquired who the Ænianians were, what was <lb/>
            the nature of the embassy which they had sent, and what <lb/>
            sacrifice he was going to perform; he told me that the <lb/>
            Ænianians were a principal nation of Thessaly, entirely <lb/>
            Grecian, being descended from Deucalion—that their <lb/>
            country extended along the Malian bay—that they called <lb/>
            their metropolis Hypata ;* as they would insinuate, because <lb/>
            it was fit to rule over all the cities of the province; as others <lb/>
            pretended, because it was situated under Mount Œta—that <lb/>
            the embassy was sent by the Ænianians every fourth year, <lb/>
            at the time of the Pythian games—and the sacrifice offered <lb/>
            to Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, who was here surprised <lb/>
            and slain,. at the very altar of Apollo, by Orestes the SOil <lb/>
            of Agamemnon. But the embassy of the present year will <lb/>
            be yet more magnificent than any of the former ones; for the <lb/>
            head of it prides himself in being descended from Achilles.</p>
          <p>"I met the young man the other day, and indeed he <lb/>
            seems worthy of the family of Peleus: such is the noble­ <lb/>
            ness of his stature and deportment, that you will easily <lb/>
            believe him sprung from a goddess.</p>
          <p>" When I wondered how it came to pass, that he, being <lb/>
            an Ænianian, should pretend that he was of the race of <lb/>
            Achilles (for Homer, our great Ægyptinn poet makes <lb/>
            Achilles a Phthiotian), “ the young man,” said Cha­ <lb/>

            and the country which extended along that bay was anciently <lb/>
            called Phthia : but the glory of the hero has induced others <lb/>
            to claim him falsely as their countryman. He is, besides, <lb/>
            in another way, related to the Æacidæ: Mnestheus is his <lb/>
            ancestor, the son of Sperchius and Polydora, the daughter <note type="footnote"> * ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υπάτας</foreign>—either from ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">υπάτος</foreign>, eminent, or ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">υποτάσσω</foreign>, to be sub­ <lb/>

            of Peleus, who went with Achilles to the siege of Troy; <lb/>
            and, being so nearly connected with him, was among the <lb/>
            chief leaders of the Myrmidons.</p>
          <p>" The ambassador abounds in arguments to support the <lb/>
            claim of his country to Achilles. He insists much upon <lb/>
            this present embassy and sacrifice to Neoptolemus; the <lb/>
            honour of performing which, all the Thessalians have, by <lb/>
            common consent, yielded up to the Ænianians, whereby <lb/>
            they admit that they are most nearly related to him."</p>
          <p>“ Whether this be truth or vain assumption, said I, be <lb/>
            so good now, if you please, as to call in the ambassador, <lb/>
            for I am extremely desirous to see him.</p>
          <p>" Charicles immediately sent to him, and the young man <lb/>
            entered with an air and aspect truly worthy of Achilles. <lb/>
            His neck straight and erect, his hair thrown back off his <lb/>
            forehead; his nose and open nostrils giving signs of an im­ <lb/>
            petuous temper; his eyes of a deep blue, inclining to black, <lb/>
            imparting an animated but amiable look to his countenance, <lb/>
            like the sea smoothing itself from a storm into a calm.</p>
          <p>" After he had received and returned our salutations, he <lb/>
            said it was time to proceed to the sacrifice, that there might <lb/>
            be sufficient space for the ceremonies which were to be per­ <lb/>
            formed to the Manes of the hero, and for the procession <lb/>
            which was to follow them.—“ I am ready," replied Charicles, <lb/>
            and rising, said to me, " If you have not yet seen Chariclea, <lb/>
            you will see her to-day; for, as a priestess of Diana, she <lb/>
            will be present at these rites and the procession.</p>
          <p>" But I, Cnemon, had often seen the young woman <lb/>
            before; I had sacrificed and conversed with her upon sacred <lb/>
            subjects. However, I said nothing of it; and, waiting for <lb/>
            what might happen, we went together to the temple. The <lb/>
            Thessalians had prepared everything ready for the sacrifice. <lb/>
            We approached the altar; the youth began the sacred rites ; <lb/>
            the priest having uttered a prayer, and from her shrine the <lb/>
            Pythoness pronounced this oracle: <lb/>
            * Delphians, regard with reverential care, <lb/>
            Both him the goddess-born, and her the fair; <lb/>
            " Grace" is the sound which ushers in her name, <lb/>
            The syllable wherewith it ends, is “Fame.” <figure type="illustration">

              They both my fans shall leave, and oceans past, <lb/>
              In regions torrid shall arrive at last; <lb/>
              There shall the gods reward their pious vows, <lb/>
              And snowy chaplets bind their dusky brows.*</p>
          <p>“ When they who surrounded the shrine heard this oracle, <lb/>
            they were perplexed, and doubted what it should signify. <lb/>
            Each interpreted it differently, as his inclinations and un­ <lb/>
            derstanding led him: none, however, laid hold of its true <lb/>
            meaning. Oracles indeed, and dreams, are generally to be <lb/>
            explained only by the event. And beside, the Delphians, <lb/>
            struck with the preparations which were making for the pro­ <lb/>
            cession, hastened to behold it, neglecting or deferring any <lb/>
            farther scrutiny into the oracular response.</p>

          <p>“ WHEN the ceremony was over, and the procession had <lb/>
            passed by," continued Calasiris“ But," said Cnemon, <lb/>
            interrupting him, " the ceremony is not over, Father; you <lb/>
            have not made me a spectator of the procession, whereas I <lb/>
            am very desirous both of hearing and seeing; you treat me <lb/>
            like a guest who, as they say, is come a day after the feast: <lb/>
            why should you just open the theatre, only to close it again?" <lb/>
            —“ I was unwilling,” said Calasiris, " to detain you from <lb/>

          <p>“ The procession began with an hecatomb of victims, led <lb/>
            by some of the inferior ministers of the temple, rough- <lb/>
            looking men, in white and girt-up garments. Their right <lb/>
            hands and breasts were naked, and they bore a two-edged <lb/>
            axe. The oxen were black, with moderately arched and <lb/>
            brawny necks-their horns equal, and very little bent; some <lb/>
            were gilt, others adorned with flowers—their legs bent <lb/>
            inwards .-and their deep dewlaps flowing down to their <lb/>
            knees-their number, in accordance with the name, exactly <lb/>
            an hundred. A variety of other different victims came <lb/>
            afterwards, each species separate and in order, attended <lb/>
            with pipes and flutes, sending forth a strain prelusive of <lb/>
            the sacrifice: these were followed by a troop of fair and <lb/>
            long-waisted Thessalian maidens, with dishevelled locks­ <lb/>
            they were distributed into two companies; the first division <lb/>
            bore baskets full of fruits and flowers; the second, vases of <lb/>
            conserves and spices, which filled the air with fragrance: <lb/>
            they carried these on their heads; thus, their hands being <lb/>
            at liberty, they joined them together, so that they could <lb/>
            move along and lead the dance. The key-note to the <lb/>
            melody was sounded by the next division, who were to sing <lb/>
            the whole of the hymn appointed for this festival, which <lb/>
            contained the praises of Thetis, of Peleus, and their pon, <lb/>
            and of Neoptolemus. After this, 0 Cnemon ” “ But <lb/>
            Cnemon me no Cnemons,” said the latter; " why not recite <lb/>
            the hymn to me instead of depriving me of so much plea­ <lb/>
            sure ? Make me, I beseech you, an auditor at this festival <lb/>
            as well as a spectator.”—“ You shall be so if you desire it," <lb/>
            said Calasiris ; " the hymn, as nearly as I can recollect, ran <lb/>
            as follows: <lb/>
            + Thetis, the go Iden-haired, we sing. <lb/>
            She who from Nereus erst did spring, <lb/>

              Thetis the golden-haired we sing, <lb/>

          <p>The dance* which accompanied this song was so well <lb/>
            adapted to it, and the cadence of their steps agreed so ex­ <lb/>
            actly with the melody of the strain, that for awhile, in spite <lb/>
            of the magnificence of the spectacle, the sense of seeing <lb/>
            was overpowered and suspended by that of hearing; and <lb/>
            all who were present, attracted by the sounds, followed <lb/>
            the advancing dancers. At length a band of youths <lb/>
            on horseback, with their splendidly dressed commander, <lb/>
            opening upon them, afforded a spectacle far preferable to <lb/>
            any sounds. Their number was exactly fifty ; they divided <lb/>
            themselves into five-and-twenty on each side guarding <lb/>
            their leader, chief of the sacred embassy, who rode in <lb/>
            the midst: their buskins, laced with a purple thong, were <lb/>
            tied above their ancles; their white garments, bordered with <lb/>
            blue, were fastened by a golden clasp over their breasts. <lb/>
            Their horses were Thessalian, and by their spirit gave token <lb/>
            of the open plains they came from ; they seemed to champ <lb/>
            with disdain the foaming bit, yet obeyed the regulating band <lb/>
            of their riders, who appeared to vie with each other in the <lb/>
            splendour of their frontlets and other trappings, which glit­ <lb/>
            tered with gold and silver. But all these, Cnemon, splendid <lb/>
            as they were, were utterly overlooked, and seemed to vanish, <lb/>
            like other objects before a flash of lightning, at the appearance <lb/>
            of their leader, my dear.Theagenes, so gallant a show did <figure type="illustration">

              he make.* He too was on horseback, and in armour, with an <lb/>
              ashen spear in his hand; his head was uncovered; he wore <lb/>
              a purple robe, on which was worked in gold the story of the <lb/>
              Centaurs and the Lapithæ; the clasp of it was of electrum, <lb/>
              and represented Pallas with the Gorgon's head on her <lb/>
              shield. A light breath of wind added to the grace of his <lb/>
              appearance; it played upon his hair, dispersed it on his <lb/>
              neck, and divided it from his forehead, throwing back the <lb/>
              extremities of his cloak in easy folds on the back and sides of <lb/>
              his horse. You would say, too, that the horse himself was <lb/>
              conscious both of his own beauty and of the beauty of his <lb/>
              rider; so stately did he arch his neck and carry his head, <lb/>
              with cars erect and fiery eyes, proudly bearing a master <lb/>
              who was proud to be thus borne. He moved along under a <lb/>
              loose rein, balancing himself equally on each side, and, <lb/>
              touching the ground with the extremity of his hoofs, <lb/>
              tempered his pace into almost an insensible motion.</p>
          <p>Every one, astonished at the appearance of this young <lb/>
            man, joined in confessing, that beauty and strength were <lb/>
            never before so gracefully mingled. The women in the <lb/>
            streets, unable to disguise their feelings, flung handfuls of <lb/>
            fruit and flowers over him, in token of their admiration and <lb/>
            affection: in short, there was but one opinion, concerning <lb/>
            hint-that it was impossible for mortal form to excel that of <lb/>
            . Theagenes. But now, when <lb/>

            as Homer says, and the beautiful and accomplished Chari­ <lb/>
            clea proceeded from tho temple of Diana, we then perceived <lb/>
            that even Theagenes might bo outshone; but only so far <lb/>
            as female beauty is naturally more engaging and alluring <lb/>
            than that of men. She was borne in a chariot drawn by two <lb/>
            white oxen—she was dressed in a purple robe embroidered <lb/>
            with gold, which flowed down to her feet—she had a girdle <lb/>
            round her waist, on which the artist had exerted all his skill: <lb/>

            behind her shoulders; their necks knotted beneath her <lb/>
            bosom; and their heads, disentangled from the knot, hung <lb/>
            down on either side as an appendage: so well were they <lb/>
            imitated, that you would say they really glided onward. <lb/>
            Their aspect was not at all terrible; their eyes swam in a <lb/>
            kind of languid lustre, as if being lulled to sleep by the <lb/>
            charms of the maiden's breast. They were wrought in <lb/>
            darkened gold, tinged with blue, the better to represent, <lb/>
            by this mixture of dark and yellow, the roughness and <lb/>
            glancing colour of the scales. Such was the maiden’s girdle. <lb/>
            Her hair was not entirely tied up, nor quite dishevelled, but <lb/>
            the greater part of it flowed down her neck, and wantoned <lb/>
            on her shoulders—a crown of laurel confined the bright and <lb/>
            ruddy locks which adorned her forehead, and prevented the <lb/>
            wind from disturbing them too roughly—she bore a gilded <lb/>
            bow in her left hand ; her quiver hung at her right shoulder <lb/>
            — in her other hand she had a lighted torch; yet the lustre <lb/>
            of her eyes paled the brightness of the torch.</p>
          <p>" Here are, indeed, Theagenes and Chariclea," cried out <lb/>
            Cnemon. " Where, where are they ? " exclaimed Calasiris; <lb/>
            who thought that Cnemon saw them.—“ I think I see them <lb/>
            now," he replied, “but it is in your lively description.”— <lb/>
            " I do not know, said Calasiris, " whether you ever saw <lb/>
            them such as all Greece and the sun beheld them on that <lb/>
            day-so conspicuous, so illustrious; she the object of wish <lb/>
            to all the men, and he to all the women; all thought them <lb/>
            equal to the immortals in beauty. But the Delphians more <lb/>
            admired the youth, and the Thessalians the maid; each <lb/>
            most struck with that form which they then saw for the <lb/>
            first time. Such is the charm of novelty.</p>
          <p>“But, Cnemon I what a sweet expectation did you raise <lb/>
            in me when you promised to show me these whom I so <lb/>
            fondly loved! and how have you deceived me! You winged <lb/>
            me with hope to expect that they would presently be here, <lb/>
            and exacted a reward for these good tidings; but, lo! <lb/>
            evening and night have overtaken us, and they nowhere <lb/>
            appear.”—“ Raise up your spirits," said Cnemon, “and <lb/>
            have a good heart; I assure you they will soon arrive. <lb/>
            Perhaps they have met with some impediment by the way, <lb/>
            for they intended to arrive much earlier. But I would not <lb/>
            shew them to you, if they were here, till you had paid me <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            the whole of my reward; if, therefore, you are in haste to <lb/>
            see them, perform your promise, and finish your story." <lb/>
            —“It is now,” replied Calasiris, " become a littie irksome <lb/>
            to me, as it will call up disagreeable remembrances; and I <lb/>
            thought, besides, that you must by this time be tired with <lb/>
            listening to so tedious a tale; but, since you seem a good <lb/>
            listener, and fond of hearing stories worth the telling, I <lb/>
            will resume my narration where I left it off. But let us <lb/>
            first light a torch, and make our libations to the gods who <lb/>
            preside over tho night;* so that, having performed our <lb/>
            devotions, we may spend, without interruption, as much as <lb/>
            we please of it in such discourses as we like." A maid, at <lb/>
            the old man’s command, brought in a lighted taper; and <lb/>
            he poured out a libation, calling upon all the gods, and <lb/>
            particularly upon Mercury; beseeching them to grant hint <lb/>
            pleasant dreams, and that those whom he most loved might <lb/>
            appear to him in his sleep. Calasiris then proceeded in <lb/>
            this manner:</p>
          <p>"After, Cnemon, that the procession had thrice com­ <lb/>
            passed the sepulchre of Ncoptolemus, and that both men <lb/>
            and women had raised over it their appropriate shout and <lb/>
            cry ;t on a signal being given, the oxen, the sheep, the goats, <lb/>
            were slaughtered at once, as if the sacrifice had been <lb/>
            performed by a single hand. Heaps of wood were piled on <lb/>
            an immense aitar; and the victims being placed thereon, <lb/>
            the priest of Apollo was desired to light the pile, and begin <lb/>
            the libation.</p>
          <p>" ‘It belongs, indeed, to me,' said Charicles, ‘to make <lb/>
            the libation ; but let the chief of the sacred embassy receive <lb/>

              Theagenes received the torch from Chariclea. From what <lb/>
              now happened, my dear Cnemon, we may infer that there <lb/>
              is something divine in the soul, and allied to a superior <lb/>
              nature; for their first glance at each other was such, as if <lb/>
              each of their souls acknowledged its partner, and hastened <lb/>
              to mingle with one which was worthy of it.*</p>
          <p>" They stood awhile, as if astonished ;† she slowly offering <lb/>
            and he slowly receiving the torch; and fixing their eyes <lb/>
            on one another, for some space, they seemed rather to have <lb/>
            been formerly acquainted, than to have now met for the <lb/>
            first time, and to be returning gradually into each other's <lb/>
            memory. Then softly, and almost imperceptibly smiling, <lb/>
            which the eyes, rather than the lips, betrayed, they both <lb/>
            blushed, as if ashamed of what they had done; and again <lb/>
            turned pale, the passion reaching their hearts. In short, <lb/>
            a thousand shades of feeling wandered in a few moments <lb/>
            over their countenances; their complexion and looks betray­ <lb/>
            ling in various ways the movements of their souls.</p>
          <p>" These emotions escaped the observation of the crowd, <lb/>
            whose attention was engaged on other things. They <lb/>
            escaped Charicles too, who was employed in reciting the <lb/>
            solemn prayers and invocations, but they did not escape <lb/>
            me, for I had particularly observed these young people, <lb/>
            from the time that the oracle was given to Theagenes in <lb/>
            . the temple; I had formed conjectures as t6 the future from <lb/>
            the allusion to their names, though I could not entirely <lb/>
            comprehend the latter part of the prediction.</p>
          <p>“At length Theagenes slowly and unwillingly turning <lb/>
            from the maiden, lighted the pile, and the solemn ceremony <lb/>
            ended. The Thessalians betook themselves to an enter­ <lb/>
            tainment, and the rest of the people dispersed to their own <lb/>
            habitations. Chariclea putting on a white robe, retired <lb/>
            with a few of her companions to her apartment, which was <lb/>
            within the precincts of the temple; for she did not live <lb/>
            with her supposed father, but dwelt apart for the better <lb/>
            performance of the temple services. <note type="footnote"> * “It is the secret sympatny, <lb/>

          <p>a Rendered curious by what I had heard and seen, 1 <lb/>
            sought an opportunity of meeting Charicles. As soon as <lb/>
            he saw me, he cried out, ‘Well, have you seen Chariclea, <lb/>
            the light of my eyes, and of Delphi ?’—‘ I have,’ I replied, <lb/>
            ‘but not now for the first time ; I have frequently before <lb/>
            seen her in the temple, and that not in a cursory manner. <lb/>
            I have often sacrificed with her, and conversed with and <lb/>
            instructed her, on various subjects, divine and human.’— <lb/>
            ‘ But what did you think of her to-day, my good friend? <lb/>
            Did she not add some ornament to the procession ?'— <lb/>
            ‘Some ornament, do you say? you might as well ask me <lb/>
            whether the moon- outshines the stars.’—‘ But some praise <lb/>
            the Thracian youth, and give him at least the second place <lb/>
            to her.’—‘ The second, if you will, and the third; but all <lb/>
            allow that your daughter was the crown and sun of the <lb/>
            ceremonial.’ Charicles was delighted with this, and smiling <lb/>
            said, ‘I am just going to see her.' I, too, was pleased, for <lb/>
            my view was to inspire him with content and confidence. <lb/>
            ‘If you will,' he added, ‘we will go together, and see <lb/>
            whether she is the worse for the fatigues the has under­ <lb/>
            gone.’ I gladly consented, but pretended I went to oblige <lb/>
            him ; and that I gave up other business of my own.</p>
          <p>“When we arrived at her apartment, we found her <lb/>
            lying uneasily upon her couch, her eves melting with <lb/>
            languor and passion.† Having as usual saluted her father, <lb/>
            he asked what was the matter with her? She complained <lb/>
            that her head ached; and said that she wished to take a <lb/>
            little rest. Charicles, alarmed, went out of the chamber, <lb/>
            ordering her maids to keep every thing quiet about her; <lb/>
            and, turning to me, ‘What languor,' said he, ‘my good <lb/>
            Calasiris, can this be, which seems to oppress my daughter ?’ <lb/>
            —‘ Wonder not,' I replied, ‘if, in such an assembly of <lb/>
            people, some envious‡ eye has looked upon her.' ‘And do <lb/>
            you, too,' he returned, smiling ironically, ‘think, with the <note type="footnote"> * “..... micat inter omnes <lb/>

              vulgar, that there is any thing in fascination?’—‘Indeed <lb/>
              I do,' said I; ‘and thus I account for its effects: this air <lb/>
              which surrounds us, which we take in with our breath, <lb/>
              receive at our eyes and nostrils, and which penetrates into <lb/>
              all our pores, brings with it those qualities with which it is <lb/>
              impregnated; and, according to their different natures, we <lb/>
              are differently affected. When any one looks at what is <lb/>
              excellent, with an envious eye, he fills the surrounding <lb/>
              atmosphere with a pernicious quality, and transmits his <lb/>
              own envenomed exhalations into whatever is nearest to <lb/>
              him. They, as they are thin and subtle, penetrate even <lb/>
              into the bones and marrow; and thus envy has become the <lb/>
              cause of a disorder to many, which has obtained the name <lb/>
              of fascination.'</p>
          <p>“Consider besides, 0 Charicles, how many have been <lb/>
            infected with inflammation of the eyes, and with other <lb/>
            contagious distempers, without ever touching, either at bed <lb/>
            or board, those who laboured under them, but solely by <lb/>
            breathing the same air with them.* The birth of love <lb/>
            affords another proof of what I am explaining, which, by <lb/>
            the eyes alone, finds a passage to the soul; and it is not <lb/>
            difficult to assign the reason; for as, of all the inlets to <lb/>
            our senses, the sight is the most quick and fiery, and most <lb/>
            various in its motions; this animated faculty most easily <lb/>
            receives the influences which surround it, and attracts to <lb/>
            itself the emanations of love.</p>
          <p>" If you wish for an example from natural history, here <lb/>
            is one taken out of our sacred books. The bird Charadrius† <lb/>
            . cures those who are afllicted with the jaundice. It it per­ <lb/>
            ceives, at a distance, any one coming towards it, who <lb/>
            labours under this distemper, it immediately runs away, <lb/>
            and shuts its eyes; not out of an envious refusal of its <lb/>
            assistance, as some suppose, but because it knows, by <lb/>
            instinct, that, on the view of the afflicted person, the <lb/>
            disorder will pass from him to itself, and therefore it is <lb/>
            solicitous to avoid encountering his eyes. You have heard, <lb/>
            perhaps, of the basilisk, which, with its breath and aspect <note type="footnote"> 0 A passage illustrative of this occurs in Achilles Tatius, B. L 4: </note> <figure type="illustration">

              alone, parches up and infects everything around it. Nor <lb/>
              is it to be wondered at, if some fascinate those whom they <lb/>
              love and wish well to; for they who are naturally envious <lb/>
              do not always act as they would wish, but as their nature <lb/>
              compels them to do. Here Charicles, after a pause, said, <lb/>
              ‘You seem to have given a very reasonable account of this <lb/>
              matter; and as you appear to admit that there are various <lb/>
              kinds of fascination, I wish hers may be that of love; I <lb/>
              should then think that she was restored to health, rather <lb/>
              than that she was disordered. You know I have often <lb/>
              besought your assistance in this matter. I should rejoice <lb/>
              rather than grieve, if this were the affection she labours <lb/>
              under, she who has so long set at nought Venus and all <lb/>
              her charms. But, I doubt, it is the more common sort of <lb/>
              fascination, that of an evil eye, which afflicts her. This <lb/>
              your wisdom will certainly enable you to cure, and your <lb/>
              friendship to us will incline you to attempt it.' I promised <lb/>
              to do all in my power to relieve her, should this be the <lb/>
              case; and we were still talking, when a man arrives in <lb/>
              haste, and calls out—‘ One would imagine, my good friends, <lb/>
              that you were invited to a fray instead of a feast, you are <lb/>
              so tardy in coming up; and yet it is the excellent Theagenes <lb/>
              who prepares it for you; and Neoptolemus, the first of <lb/>
              heroes, who presides at it. Come away, for shame, and do <lb/>
              not make us wait for you until evening. Nobody is absent <lb/>
              but yourselves.'</p>
          <p>" 'This,' whispers Charicles, ‘ is but a rough inviter;* <lb/>
            the gifts of Bacchus have not mended his manners. But <lb/>
            let us go, lest he come from words to blows.' I smiled at <lb/>
            his pleasantry, and said I was ready to attend him. When <lb/>
            we entered, Theagenes placed Charicles next to himself; <lb/>
            and paid some attention to me, out of respect to him. But <lb/>
            why should I fatigue you with a detail of the entertain­ <lb/>
            ments ; the dancing and singing girls, the youths in armour, <lb/>
            who moved in Pyrrhic measures; the variety of dishes with <lb/>
            which Theagenes had decked his table, in order to make <lb/>
            the feast more jovial? But what follows is necessary for <lb/>
            you to hear, and pleasant for me to relate. Our entertainer <lb/>
            endeavoured to preserve a cheerful countenance, and forced <lb/>
            himself to behave with ease and politeness to his company; <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig13.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="72"/>
              but I perceived plainly what he suffered within; his eyes <lb/>
              wandered, and he sighed involuntarily. Now he would be <lb/>
              melancholy and thoughtful; then on a sudden, recollecting <lb/>
              himself, his looks brightened, and he put on a forced cheer­ <lb/>
              fulness. In short, it is not easy to describe the changes <lb/>
              he underwent; for the mind of a lover, like that of one <lb/>
              overcome with wine, cannot long remain in the same <lb/>
              situation, both their souls fluctuating with weak and un­ <lb/>
              steady passion. For which reason a lover is disposed to <lb/>
              drink; and lie who has drunk is inclined to love.</p>
          <p>Is At length, from his yawning, his sighs, and his anxiety, <lb/>
            the rest of the company begun to perceive that he was <lb/>
            indisposed; so that even Charicles, who had not hitherto <lb/>
            observed his uneasiness, whispered me, ' I fancy an envious <lb/>
            eye has looked upon him also; he seems to be affected <lb/>
            much in the same manner as Chariclea.' Indeed, I think <lb/>
            so, too, I replied; and it is probable enough, for next after <lb/>
            her in the procession, as being most conspicuous, he was <lb/>
            most exposed to envy.</p>
          <p>" But now the cups were carried round; and Theagenes, <lb/>
            out of complaisance rather than inclination, drank to every <lb/>
            body. When it came to me, I said I was obliged to him <lb/>
            for the compliment, but must beg to be excused tasting of <lb/>
            the cup. He looked displeased and angry, as if he thought <lb/>
            himself affronted; when Charicles explained- the matter, <lb/>
            and told him I was an Egyptian, an inhabitant of Memphis, <lb/>
            and a priest of Isis, and consequently abstained from wine <lb/>
            and all animal food. Theagenes seemed filled with a sudden <lb/>
            pleasure when he heard that I was an Egyptian and a <lb/>
            priest; and raising himself up, as if he had suddenly found <lb/>
            a treasure, he called for water, and drinking to me, said, <lb/>
            '0 sage, receive from me this mark of good-will, in the <lb/>
            beverage which is most agreeable to you; and let this table* <lb/>
            conclude a solemn treaty of friendship between us.' — <lb/>
            ‘ With all my heart," I replied, 'most excellent Theagenes; <lb/>
            1 have already conceived a friendship for you;” and taking <lb/>
            the cup, I drank-and with this the company broke up, and <lb/>
            dispersed to their several habitations ; Theagenes embracing <lb/>
            me at parting with the warmth and affection of an old friend.</p>
          <p>is When I retired to my chamber, I could not sleep the <figure type="illustration">

              first part of the night. My thoughts continually ran upon <lb/>
              these young people, and upon the conclusion of the oracle, <lb/>
              and I endeavoured to penetrate into its meaning. But, <lb/>
              towards the middle of the night, methought I saw Apollo <lb/>
              and Diana advancing towards me (if it were indeed only <lb/>
              imagination, and not a reality): one led Theagenes, the <lb/>
              other Chariclea. They seemed to deliver them into my <lb/>
              hands; and the goddess calling me by my name, thus <lb/>
              addressed me:</p>
          <p>" 'It is time for you now to return to your country, for <lb/>
            such is the decree of fate. Depart therefore yourself, and take <lb/>
            these under your protection; make them the companions <lb/>
            of your journey; treat them as your children; and carry <lb/>
            them from Egypt, where and howsoever it shall please <lb/>
            the gods to ordain.'—Having said this, they disappeared, <lb/>
            signifying first that this was a vision, and not a common <lb/>
            dream.*</p>
          <p>“I understood plainly the commands they gave me ; <lb/>
            except that I doubted what land it was, to which I was at <lb/>
            last to conduct these persons.”—“ If you found this out <lb/>
            afterwards, Father," said Cnemon,“ you will inform me at a <lb/>
            proper season; in the mean time tell me in what manner <lb/>
            they signified, as you said, that this was not a common <lb/>
            dream, but a real appearance." — In the same manner, <lb/>
            my son, as the wise Homer intimates ; though many do not <lb/>
            perceive the hidden sense that is contained in these lines: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig15.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>" As they departed, I their legs and feet <lb/>
            To glide did see; the gods are known with ease."</p>
          <p>" I must confess," said Cnemon, " that I am one of the <lb/>
            many, and perhaps you imagined so when you quoted these <lb/>
            verses. I have understood the common sense of the words, <lb/>
            ever since I first read them, but cannot penetrate any hidden <lb/>
            theological meaning that may be couched under them.”— <lb/>
            Calasiris considering a little, and applying his mind to the <lb/>
            explanation of this mystery, replied: <figure type="illustration">

            They may not be manifest to the profane, but cannot be <lb/>

            and Neptune in the lines quoted before—''<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ρεῖν ἕγνων</foreign>'— <lb/>
            as if gliding in his gait; for so is the verse to be construed <lb/>
            —‘ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥεῖν</foreign> airt<foreign xml:lang="grc">οντος</foreign>,’ gliding away; not, as some erroneously <lb/>

          <p>is You have initiated me into this mystery,” replied <lb/>
            Cnemon; " but how come you to call Homer an Egyptian ? <lb/>
            It is the first time I ever heard him called so. I will not <lb/>
            insist that he is not your countryman ; but I should be <lb/>
            exceedingly glad to hear your reasons for claiming hint as <lb/>
            such.”—“ This is not exactly the time," said Calasiris, " for <lb/>
            such a discussion ; however, as you desire it, I will shortly <lb/>
            mention the grounds upon which I go.</p>
          <p>"Different authors have ascribed to Homer different <lb/>
            countries-indeed the country of a wise man t is in every <lb/>
            land ; but he was, in fact, an Egyptian, of the city of <lb/>
            Thebes, as you may learn from himself. His supposed <lb/>
            father was a priest there; his real one, Mercury. For the <lb/>
            wife of the priest whose son he was taken to be, while she <lb/>
            was celebrating some sacred mysteries, slept in the temple. <lb/>
            Mercury enjoyed her company; and impregnated her with <lb/>
            Homer; and he bore to his dying day a mark of his spu­ <note type="footnote"> * “ Vera incessu patuit Dea.”—Virg. Æn. i. 405. </note><note type="footnote"> t “ Ogni stanza al valent’ uomo <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign> patria.—Guarini, Pastor Fido. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            nous origin. From Thebes he wandered into various coun­ <lb/>
            tries, and particularly into Greece; singing his verses, and <lb/>
            obtaining the name he bore. He never told his real one, nor <lb/>
            his country, nor family; but those who knew of this mark <lb/>
            upon his body, took occasion from it to give him the name <lb/>
            of Homer ;* for, immediately from his birth, a profusion of <lb/>
            hair appeared upon both his thighs."</p>
          <p>" On what account, my father, did he conceal the place of <lb/>
            his birth ?"—" Possibly he was unwilling to appear a fugi­ <lb/>
            tire; for he was driven out by his father, and not admitted <lb/>
            among the sacred youths, on account of the peculiar mark <lb/>
            he bore on his body, indicating his spurious origin. Or, <lb/>
            perhaps, he had a wise design in keeping the real spot of his <lb/>
            nativity a secret, as by so doing he might claim every land <lb/>
            he passed through as his fatherland.”—“ I cannot help," <lb/>
            said Cnemon, " being half persuaded of the truth of this <lb/>
            account you give of Homer. His poems breathe all the <lb/>
            softness and luxuriance of Egypt; and from their excel­ <lb/>
            lency, bespeak something of a divine original in their <lb/>
            author.</p>
          <p>“But after that, by Homer's assistance, you had dis­ <lb/>
            covered the true nature of these deities, what happened ? " <lb/>
            —" Much the same as before: watchings, thoughts, and <lb/>
            cares, which night and darkness nourish. I was glad that I <lb/>
            had discovered something, which I had in vain attempted to <lb/>
            explain before; and rejoiced at the near prospect of my <lb/>
            return to my country. But I was grieved to think that <lb/>
            Charicles was to be deprived of his daughter. I was in <lb/>
            great doubt in what manner the young people were to be <lb/>
            taken away together ; how to prepare for their flight; how <lb/>
            to do it privately, whither to direct it; and whether <lb/>
            by land or by sea. In short, I was overwhelmed with <lb/>
            a sea of troubles;t and spent the remainder of the night <lb/>
            restless, and without sleep. But the day scarce began to <lb/>
            dawn, when I heard a knocking at the gate of my court, <lb/>
            and somebody calling my servant.</p>
          <p>“ The boy asked who it was that knocked, and what he <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ομηρος</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">μηρός</foreign> in Greek signifies a thigh. For the various <lb/>
            accounts respecting Homer, and the origin of his name, see p. 59 of <lb/>

            wanted. The person replied, that he was Theagenes the <lb/>
            Thessalian.—I was very glad to hear this, and ordered him <lb/>
            to be introduced; thinking this an excellent opportunity to <lb/>
            lay some foundation for the design I meditated. I supposed <lb/>
            that, having discovered at the entertainment that I was <lb/>
            an Egyptian, and a priest, he came to ask my advice and <lb/>
            resistance in the attachment which now influenced him. <lb/>
            ] le thought, perhaps, as many wrongly do, that the science <lb/>
            or the Egyptians was only of one sort. But there is one <lb/>
            branch in the hands of the common mass, as I may say, <lb/>
            crawling on the ground; busied in the service of idols, and <lb/>
            the care of dead bodies ; poring over herbs, and murmuring <lb/>
            incantations; neither itself aiming, nor leading those who <lb/>
            apply to it to aim, at any good end; and most frequently <lb/>
            failing in what it professes to effect. Sometimes succeeding <lb/>
            in matters of a gloomy and despicable nature; showing <lb/>
            imaginary visions as though real; encouraging wickedness; <lb/>
            and ministering to lawless pleasures. But the other branch <lb/>
            of Egyptian science, my SOil, is the true wisdom ; of which <lb/>
            that which I have just mentioned is the base-born offspring. <lb/>
            This is that in which our priests and seers are from their <lb/>
            youth initiated. This is of a far more excellent nature; <lb/>
            looks to heavenly things, and converses with the gods; <lb/>
            inquires into the motions of the stars, and gains an insight <lb/>
            into futurity; far removed from evil and earthly matters, <lb/>
            and turning all its views to what is honourable and beneficial <lb/>
            to mankind. It was this which prompted me to retire a <lb/>
            while from my country-to avoid, if possible, the ills which <lb/>
            it enabled me to foresee, and the discord which was to arise <lb/>
            between my children. But these events must be left to the <lb/>
            gods, and the fates, who have power either to accomplish or <lb/>
            to hinder them; and who, perhaps, ordained my flight, in <lb/>
            order that I might meet with Chanclea. I will now proceed <lb/>
            with my narration.</p>
          <p>“ Theagenes entered my apartment; and, after I had <lb/>
            received and returned his salute, I placed him near me on <lb/>
            the bed, and asked what was the occasion of so early a visit. <lb/>
            -lIe stroked his face, and, after a long pause, said: ‘I am <lb/>
            in the greatest perplexity, and yet blush to disclose the <lb/>
            cause of it and here he stopped. I saw that this was the <lb/>
            time for dissimulation, and for pretending to discover what <lb/>
            I already knew. Looking therefore archly upon him, I</p><pb n="77"/>
            
          <p>Midi Though you seem unwilling to speak out, yet nothing <lb/>
            escapes my knowledge, with the assistance of the gods.’— <lb/>
            With this I raised myself a little, counting over certain <lb/>
            numbers upon my fingers, (which in reality meant nothing; <lb/>
            shaking my locks, like one moreover under a sudden influ­ <lb/>
            ence of the divinity, I cried out, " My son, you are in love.' <lb/>
            -He started at this ; but, when I added—‘ and with Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea,' he thought I was really divinely inspired; and was <lb/>
            ready to fall at my feet, and worship me. When I pre­ <lb/>
            vented this, he * kissed my head, and gave thanks to the gods <lb/>
            that lie had really found my knowledge as great as he <lb/>
            expected, He besought me to be his preserver; for, unless <lb/>
            preserved by my assistance, and that quickly, he was undone, <lb/>
            so violent a passion had seized upon him; desire so con- <lb/>
            Burned him—him, who now first knew what it was to love.</p>
          <p>" He swore to me, with many protestations, that he never <lb/>
            had enjoyed the company of women—that he had always <lb/>
            rejected them-and professed himself an enemy to mar­ <lb/>
            riage, and a rebel to Venus, until subdued by the charms of <lb/>
            Chariclea—that this did not arise from any forced tem­ <lb/>
            perance, or natural coldness of constitution; but he had <lb/>
            never before seen a woman whom he thought worthy of his <lb/>
            love-and having said this, he wept, as if indignant at being <lb/>
            subdued by a weak girl. I raised him, comforted, and bade <lb/>
            him be of good cheer; for, since he had applied to me, he <lb/>
            should find that her coyness would yield to my art. I knew <lb/>
            that she was haughty, protesting against love, so as not to <lb/>
            bear even the name of Venus or wedlock; but I would <lb/>
            leave no stone unturned to serve him. Art, said 1, can <lb/>
            outdo even nature: only be not cast down, but act as I <lb/>
            shall direct you.</p>
          <p>“He promised that he would obey me in every thing; <lb/>
            even if I should order hint to go through fire and sword. <lb/>
            While he was thus eager in protestations, and profuse in his <lb/>
            promises of laving at my feet all he was worth, a messenger <lb/>
            came from Charicles, saying that his master desired me to <lb/>
            come to him—that he was near, in the temple of Apollo, <lb/>
            where be was chanting a hymn to appease the deity; having <lb/>
            been much disturbed in the night by a dream.</p>
          <p>“ I arose immediately, and dismissing Theagenes, hastened <lb/>
            to the temple; where I found Charicles reclining sorrow­ <note type="footnote"> * “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλήσω τ</foreign>’ it <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέμις, τὸ σὸν κάρα</foreign>.”—Soph. Œd. Col. 1131. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            fully upon a seat, and sighing deeply. I approached him, <lb/>
            and inquired why be was so melancholy and cast down.— <lb/>
            'How can I be otherwise, he replied, when I have been <lb/>
            terrified by dreams P and hear too, this morning, that my <lb/>
            daughter still continues indisposed, and has passed a sleep­ <lb/>
            less night. I am the more concerned at this, not only on <lb/>
            her own account, but also because to-morrow is the day <lb/>
            appointed for the display of those who * run in armour; at <lb/>
            which ceremony the priestess of Diana is to preside, and <lb/>
            hold up a torch. Either, therefore, the festival will lose <lb/>
            much of itsaccustomed splendour by her absence; or if <lb/>
            sibe comes against her will, she may increase her illness. <lb/>
            Wherefore let me now beseech you, by our friendship, and <lb/>
            by the god at whose altar we are, to come to her assistance, <lb/>
            and think of some remedy. I know you can easily, if you <lb/>
            please, cure this fascination, if such it be-the priests of <lb/>
            Egypt can do far greater things than these.'</p>
          <p>“ I confessed that I had been negligent (the better to <lb/>
            carry on the deception) ; and requested a day's time to <lb/>
            prepare some medicines, which I thought necessary for her <lb/>
            cure. Let us now, however, I continued, make her a visit; <lb/>
            consider more accurately the nature of her complaint; and, <lb/>
            if possible, administer to her some consolation. At the <lb/>
            same time, Charicles, I beg you will say a few words to her <lb/>
            concerning me; inspire her with regard for my person, and <lb/>
            confidence in my skill, that so the cure may proceed the <lb/>
            better. He promised that he would do so ; and we went toge-. <lb/>
            there But why say much of the situation in which we found <lb/>
            the luckless Chariclea ? She was entirely prostrated by her <lb/>
            passion ; the bloom was flown from her cheeks; and tears <lb/>
            flowing like water had extinguished the lustre of her eyes. <lb/>
            She endeavoured, however to compose herself, when she <lb/>
            saw us; and to resume her usual voice and countenance. <lb/>
            Charicles embraced, kissed and soothed her. ‘ My dear <lb/>
            daughter,' he cried, 'why will you hide your sufferings <lb/>
            from your father ? and while you labour under a fasci­ <lb/>
            nation, you are silent as if you were the injurer, instead <lb/>
            of being the injured party : an evil eye has certainly looked <lb/>
            upon you. But be of good cheer: here is the wise Calar <note type="footnote"> * Of one of whom Pindar says— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              siris, who has promised to attempt your cure; and he, if <lb/>
              any one is able, can effect it; for he has been bred up from <lb/>
              his youth in the study of things divine, and is himself a <lb/>
              priest; and what is more than all, he is mv dearest friend. <lb/>
              Resign yourself up, therefore, entirely to his management; <lb/>
              suffer him to treat you as he pleases, either by incantations <lb/>
              or any other method—you have, I know, no aversion to the <lb/>

          <p>" Chariclea motioned her consent, as though not dis­ <lb/>
            pleased at the proposal-and we then took our leave; Chari­ <lb/>
            cles putting me in mind of what he had first recommended to <lb/>
            my anxious care ; beseeching me, if possible, to inspire his <lb/>
            daughter with an inclination for love and marriage. I sent <lb/>
            him away in good spirits: assuring him that I would shortly <lb/>

          <p>“ THE ensuing day ended the Pythian games; but not the <lb/>
            conflict of the youthful pair; Love was the arbiter, and in <lb/>
            the persons of these his combatants, determined to exhibit <lb/>
            his mightiest contest. Towards the end of the ceremony, <lb/>
            when all Greece was looking on, and the Amphictyons sat <lb/>
            as judges; when the races, the wrestlings, and the boxing <lb/>
            matches were over; a herald came forward, and made pro­ <lb/>
            clamation for the men in armour to appear. At that instant <lb/>
            the priestess Chariclea shone out like some fair star at the <lb/>
            end of the course; for she bad prevailed with herself, how­ <lb/>
            ever unfit, to come forth, that she might comply with the <lb/>
            custom of her country: and perhaps not without a secret <lb/>
            hope of seeing Theagenes. Shé bore a torch in her left <lb/>
            hand, and a branch of palm in her right. At her appear­ <lb/>
            ance every eye in the assembly was turned upon her, but <lb/>
            none sooner than that of Theagenes; for what is so quick <lb/>
            as the glance of a lover ? He, who perhaps had beard that <lb/>
            it was probable she might come, had his whole mind intent <lb/>
            upon that expectation; and, when she appeared, was not <lb/>
            able to contain himself; but said softly to me, who sat next <lb/>
            to him, ‘’Tis she herself; 'tis Chariclea!’ I bid him be <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            silent, and campose himself. And now, at the summons of, <lb/>
            the herald, a warrior stood forth; splendidly armed, of noble <lb/>
            air, and distinguished appearance; who had formerly been <lb/>
            victor in many contests, but at this meeting had not en­ <lb/>
            gaged in any, probably because he could not find a compe­ <lb/>
            titor; and none now appearing to oppose him, the Amphyc­ <lb/>
            tyons ordered him to retire, the law not permitting any ono <lb/>
            to be crowned who had not contended. He begged the <lb/>
            herald might be suffered again to make proclamation, which <lb/>
            he did, calling upon some one to enter the lists.</p>
          <p>" Theagenes said to me, ' This Joan calls upon me.’— <lb/>
            ‘ How so ?’ said I,—‘ He does indeed,' he replied ; ‘ for no <lb/>
            other, while I am present and behold it, shall receive a <lb/>
            crown from the hands of Chariclca.’—‘ But do you not con­ <lb/>
            sider the disgrace, if you should fail of success?’—‘ Will <lb/>
            any one outrun me in speed and in desire to see and be <lb/>
            near Chariclea?* To whom will the sight of her add <lb/>
            swifter wings and more impetuous speed P You know that <lb/>
            the painters make Love winged, signifying thereby how rapid <lb/>
            are the motions of his captives; and, were I inclined to <lb/>
            boast, I could say that no one hitherto has been able to <lb/>
            excel me in swiftness.’—And immediately he sprang up, <lb/>
            came forward, gave in his name and family, and took his <lb/>
            allotted place.</p>
          <p>“ He stood there in complete armour, expecting with <lb/>
            trembling eagerness the signal of the trumpet, and scarce <lb/>
            able to wait for it. It was a noble and all-engrossing spec­ <lb/>
            tacle, as when Homer† describes Achilles contending on <lb/>
            the banks of Scamander. The whole assembly was moved <lb/>
            at his unexpected appearance, and felt as much interested <lb/>
            in his success as they would have done for their own; such <lb/>
            power has beauty to conciliate the minds of men. But Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea was affected more than all: I watched her counte­ <lb/>
            nance, and saw the changes of it. And when the herald <lb/>
            proclaimed the names of the racers—Ormenus the Area­ <lb/>
            dian, and Theagenes the Thessalian—when they sprang <lb/>
            forward from the goal, and ran together with a swiftness <note type="footnote"> * It would seem that Chariclea stood with her palm and torch at <lb/>

            almost too rapid for the eye to follow-then the maiden <lb/>
            was unable to contain herself; her limbs trembled, and her <lb/>
            feet quivered, as if they could assist the course of her lover, <lb/>
            on whom her whole soul was intent. The spectators were <lb/>
            on the very tiptoe of expectation, and full of solicitude for <lb/>
            the issue; and I more than all, who had now determined to <lb/>
            regard Theagenes as my own son."</p>
          <p>" No wonder," said Cnemon, " that those present were in <lb/>
            an agony of expectation; when I, even now, am trembling <lb/>
            for Theagenes. Deliver me, therefore, I beseech you, as <lb/>
            soon as you can, out of my suspense</p>
          <p>" When they had not finished more than half their <lb/>
            course its continued Calasiris, "Theagenes turning a little, <lb/>
            and casting a stern glance at Ormenus, lifted up his shield <lb/>
            on high, and stretching out his neck, and fixing his eves <lb/>
            intently on Chariclea, flew like an arrow to the goal, leaving <lb/>
            the Arcadian far behind him. When he reached the maiden, <lb/>
            he fell upon her bosom; not, I imagine, without design, <lb/>
            but in appearance as if unable to check on a sudden the <lb/>
            rapidity of his pace. When he took the palm from her <lb/>
            hand, I observed he kissed it."</p>
          <p>" You have relieved my mind," said Cnemon; " I rejoice <lb/>
            that he has both obtained the victory, and kissed his mis­ <lb/>
            tress. But what happened afterwards ?"—" You are not <lb/>
            only insatiable of hearing, Cnemon, but invincible by sleep; <lb/>
            a great part of the night is now spent, and you are still <lb/>
            wakeful, still attentive to my tedious story."—" I am at <lb/>
            feud with Homer,* father, for saying that love, as well as <lb/>
            everything else, brings satiety in the end; for my part I <lb/>
            am never tired either of feeling it myself, or hearing of its <lb/>
            influence on others; and lives there the man of so iron and <lb/>
            adamantine an heart, as not to be enchanted with listen­ <lb/>
            ing to the loves of Theagenes and Chariclea, though the <lb/>
            story were to last a year? Go on, therefore, I beseech <lb/>
            you."</p>
          <p>" Theagenes," continued Calasiris, " was crowned, pro­ <lb/>
            claimed victor, and conducted home with universal applause. <lb/>
            But Chariclea was utterly vanquished ; the second sight of <lb/>
            Theagenes fixed deep that love which the first had inspired ; <note type="footnote"> * It xiii. 636. <lb/>

            for the mutual looks of lovers revive and redouble their <lb/>
            passion; sight inflames the imagination, as fuel increases <lb/>
            fire. She went home, and spent a night as bad or worse <lb/>
            than the former one. I, too, was sleepless as before, rumi­ <lb/>
            nating how I should conceal our flight, and into what <lb/>
            country it was the intention of the gods that I should con­ <lb/>
            duct my young companions. I conjectured, from the words <lb/>
            of the oracle, that it was to be by sea: <lb/>
            —" and oceans past, <lb/>
            In regions torrid shall arrive at last ;" <lb/>
            but I could think only of one method to obtain some infor­ <lb/>
            mation whither I ought to take them; and that was, if I <lb/>
            could gain a sight of the fillet which was exposed with Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea; on which, as Charicles said, some particulars relating <lb/>
            to her were written. It was probable that I might learn <lb/>
            from thence the names of her parents, and of her country, <lb/>
            which I already guessed at; and it was thither, most likely, <lb/>
            that the fates would direct her course. I went, therefore, <lb/>
            in the morning, to the apartment of Chariclea; I found all <lb/>
            her servants in tears, and Charicles in the deepest distress. <lb/>
            I inquired into the cause of this agitation.</p>
          <p>“‘My daughter's malady,' he replied, increases visibly ; <lb/>
            she has passed a wretched night, worse than the preceding <lb/>
            one’—Upon this I desired that he, and all who were pre­ <lb/>
            sent, would leave the room ; and that some one would pro­ <lb/>
            cure for me a tripod, laurel, fire, and frankincense; and <lb/>
            that no one would disturb me till I should call for them. <lb/>
            Charicles ordered everything to be disposed as I desired. <lb/>
            When I was left at liberty, I began a kind of scenical repre­ <lb/>
            sentation ; I burnt my incense, I muttered a few prayers, <lb/>
            and with the branch of laurel stroked Chariclea several <lb/>
            times from head to foot. At last, after having played a <lb/>
            hundred fooleries with myself and the maiden, I began <lb/>
            yawning, grew tired of the mummery, and ceased. Ste <lb/>
            smiled, shook her head, and signified that I was in an error, <lb/>
            and had entirely mistaken the nature of her disorder. I <lb/>
            approached nearer to her, and bid her be of good cheer, for <lb/>
            her malady was by no means uncommon or difficult of cure <lb/>
            -that she was undoubtedly fascinated, perhaps when she <lb/>
            was present at the procession, but most probably when she <lb/>
            presided at.the race-that: I suspected who had fascinated <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            her-that my suspicions fell upon Theagenes, who ran the <lb/>
            armour race ; for I had observed with what an intent and <lb/>
            ardent eye he gazed upon her.</p>
          <p>“‘ Whether he looked at me or not,' she replied, ‘ say no <lb/>
            more of him ; yet tell me who is he, and whence does he <lb/>
            come? I saw many admiring him.’—I told her that she <lb/>
            had already heard from the herald that he was a Thessalian <lb/>
            -that he himself claimed to be of the family of Achilles; <lb/>
            and, I thought, not without great appearance of truth: for <lb/>
            his beauty and stature bespoke him a descendant from that <lb/>
            hero. Yet he was not, like. him, insolent or arrogant, but <lb/>
            possessed an elevated mind, tempered with sweetness; and <lb/>
            though he has an evil eye, and has fascinated you, he suffers <lb/>
            worse torments than he has inflicted.</p>
          <p>“ ‘ Father,' said she, ‘I am obliged to you for the com­ <lb/>
            passion you express for mo ; but do not wish ill to one who <lb/>
            perhaps has not committed any wrong. My malady is not <lb/>
            fascination, but, I think, of another kind.’—‘Why do you <lb/>
            conceal it then, my daughter, and not tell it freely, that <lb/>
            you may meet with some relief? Consider me as a father <lb/>
            to you, in age at least, and more in good-will. Am not I <lb/>
            well known to, and the intimate friend of, Charicles P Tell <lb/>
            me the cause of your disorder : put confidence in me; I <lb/>
            swear I will not betray it. Speak freely, and do not increase <lb/>
            your sufferings by concealing them: there is no disease, <lb/>
            which when easily known, is not easily cured ; but that <lb/>
            which is become inveterate by time is almost incurable <lb/>
            silence nourishes anguish; what is disclosed admits of con­ <lb/>
            solation and relief.’—After a pause, in which her counte­ <lb/>
            nance betrayed the various agitations of her mind, she said, <lb/>
            ‘ Suffer me to continue silent to-day, I will be more explicit <lb/>
            hereafter ; if the art of divination, in which you are skilled, <lb/>
            has not already discovered to you all I have to tell you.'</p>
          <p>“Upon this I arose and took my leave, hinting to the <lb/>
            maiden the necessity of overcoming her modesty and re­ <lb/>
            serve. Charicles met me. ‘ What have you to tell me ?' <lb/>
            said he. 'All good news,' I replied. ‘ To-morrow your <lb/>
            daughter shall bo cured of her complaint, and something <note type="footnote"> * ——“ Honoratum si forto reponis Achillem, <lb/>

            else shall happen which you greatly desire; in the mean­ <lb/>
            time, however, it may not be amiss to send for a physician <lb/>
            and having said this, I retired, that he might ask me no <lb/>
            more questions.</p>
          <p>“ I had not gone far, when I saw Theagenes wandering <lb/>
            about the precincts of the temple, talking to himself, and <lb/>
            seeming satisfied if he could only see the place where <lb/>
            Chariclea dwelt. Turning aside, I passed by as if I had not <lb/>
            observed him; but he cried out, Calasiris, I rejoice to see <lb/>
            you! listen to me; I have been long waiting for you.' <lb/>
            Iturned suddenly. ‘My handsome Theagenes,' said I, <lb/>
            ‘I did not observe you.' How can he be hnndsolne,' he <lb/>
            replied, ‘ who cannot please Chariclea?’ I pretended to <lb/>
            be angry. ‘Will you not cease,' I said, 'to dishonour <lb/>
            me and my art, which has already worked upon her, and <lb/>
            compelled her to love you? and she now desires, above all <lb/>
            things, to see you.’ ‘ To see me!’ he exclaimed ; ' what is <lb/>
            it you tell me ? why do not you instantly lead me to her <lb/>
            and immediately he began advancing. I caught hold of <lb/>
            his robe: ‘Hold,’ I cried, however famous you are for speed, <lb/>
            this is not a business to be ventured upon in haste; it re­ <lb/>
            quires consideration and management, and many prepara­ <lb/>
            tions, in order to ensure success and safety. You must not <lb/>
            think to bear off by force so rich a prize. Do not you know <lb/>
            that her father is one of the principal men of Delphi; and <lb/>
            that such an attempt would here incur a capital punish­ <lb/>
            ment ?’ 'I regard not death,' he replied, ' if I can <lb/>
            possess Chariclea; however, if you think it better, let us <lb/>
            ask her in marriage of her father. I am not unworthy of <lb/>
            his alliance.' ‘ We should not obtain her,' I answered; <lb/>
            ‘ not that there can be any objection to you, but Charicles <lb/>
            has long ago promised her to his sister's son.' , He <lb/>
            shall have no reason to rejoice in his good fortune,' said <lb/>
            Theagenes. ‘ No one, while I am alive, shall make Chariclea <lb/>
            his bride; my hand and sword have not yet so far forgot <lb/>
            their office.' ‘Moderate your passion,' I replied; 'there <lb/>
            is no occasion for your sword; only be guided by me, and <lb/>
            do as I shall direct you. At present retire, and avoid being <lb/>
            seen often in public with me; but visit me sometimes, <lb/>
            quietly and in private.' He went away quite cast down.</p>
          <p>“ On the morrow Charicles met me: as soon as lie saw <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            me he rnn up to me, and repeatedly kissed my head, crying <lb/>
            out, . How great is the force of wisdom and friendship! <lb/>
            You have accomplished the great work. The impregnable <lb/>
            is taken. The invincible is vanquished. Chariclca is in <lb/>
            lovo!’</p>
          <p>" At this I began to arch my eyebrows: I put on a con­ <lb/>
            sequential air, and proudly paced the room. ‘ No marvel,’ <lb/>
            said 1, ‘that she has not been able to resist even the first <lb/>
            application of my spells, and yet I have hitherto employed <lb/>
            only some of the weakest of them. But how came you <lb/>
            acquainted with what you are rejoicing at?' , According <lb/>
            to your advice,' said he, 'I sent for some physicians of <lb/>
            whom I had a high opinion. I took them to visit my <lb/>
            daughter, promising them large fees if they could afford her <lb/>
            any relief. As soon as they entered her apartment they <lb/>
            inquired into the cause of her complaint. She turned from <lb/>
            them, made no reply to their inquiries, and kept repeating a <lb/>
            verse from Homer,* the sense of which is,­ <lb/>
            ' Achilles, Peleus' son, thou flower of Greeks.' <lb/>
            At length the sagacious Acestinus (perhaps you know him) <lb/>
            seized her unwilling hand, hoping to discover by her pulse <lb/>
            the movements of her heart. He felt it, and, after some <lb/>
            consideration, said, ‘ 0 Charicles, it is in vain you call upon <lb/>
            us for assistance; the leech's art can here be of no use.' <lb/>
            My God,' cried I, ‘what is it you say ? My daughter is <lb/>
            dying, and you give me no hope.' ‘Compose yourself,' <lb/>
            he replied, ‘ and attend to me;' and taking me aside he <lb/>
            thus addressed me:—</p>
          <p>“‘ Our art professes to heal only the disorders of the body, <lb/>
            not those of the mind, except only when the mind suffers <lb/>
            with the afflicted body; when one is cured the other is <lb/>
            relieved. Your daughter certainly labours under a malady, <lb/>
            but it is not a corporeal one. She has no redundant <lb/>
            humours, no head-ache, no fever, no distemper which has its <lb/>
            origin in the body-this I can venture to pronounce. I <lb/>
            besought him, if he knew what really ailed her, that he <lb/>
            would tell me. At last he said, 'Does she not know herself <lb/>
            that the malady is a mental one-that it is, in one word, <lb/>
            love ? Do you not see how her swelled eyes, her unsettled <note type="footnote"> * II. xvL 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            look, her pale countenance, betray the wounded heart P <lb/>
            Her thoughts wander, her discourse is unconnected, she <lb/>
            gets no sleep, and visibly falls away; some relief must be <lb/>
            sought for, but he alone for whom she pines can, I think, <lb/>
            afford it.' Having so said, he took his leave. I hastened <lb/>
            to you, as to a god and preserver, who alone have it in your <lb/>
            power, as both I and my daughter acknowledge, to do us <lb/>
            good. For when I was pressing her, in the most affec­ <lb/>
            tionate manner, to discover to me the cause of her com­ <lb/>
            plaint, she answered that she knew not what was the matter <lb/>
            with her; this only she knew, that Calasiris alone could <lb/>
            heal her, and besought me to call you to her; from which I <lb/>
            perceive that she has the greatest opinion of, and confidence <lb/>
            in, your wisdom.'</p>
          <p>“‘ Since you have found out that site is in love,' I replied, <lb/>
            'can you conjecture with whom ?’ ‘ No, by Apollo,' said <lb/>
            he; ‘ how should I discover that ? I wish with all my <lb/>
            heart it may be with Alcamenes, my sister's son. I have <lb/>
            long destined him for her spouse, if my wishes can have <lb/>
            weight with her.' I told him it was easy to make the <lb/>
            experiment, by bringing the young man into her presence. <lb/>
            He seemed to approve of this and went away.</p>
          <p>“ Soon after I met him in the market-place. ‘I have <lb/>
            very disagreeable news,' said he, ‘ my daughter is certainly <lb/>
            possessed, she behaves in so strange a manner. I intro­ <lb/>
            duced Alcamenes to her, as you desired; and he had taken <lb/>
            care about his personal appearance, but she, as if she had <lb/>
            seen the Gorgon's head, or anything more frightful, gave a <lb/>
            piercing shriek, turned her face aside, and, grasping her <lb/>
            neck with both her hands, protested that she would strangle <lb/>
            herself, if we did not instantly leave the room. This, you <lb/>
            may imagine, we hastened to do upon seeing such mon­ <lb/>
            strously strange conduct. And wo again entreat you to <lb/>
            save her life, and to fulfil, if possible, our wishes.’</p>
          <p>“‘ 0 Charicles,' I replied, ‘ you were not mistaken in <lb/>
            saying your daughter was possessed. She is, indeed, beset <lb/>
            by those powers which I was obliged to employ against her. <lb/>
            They are very potent, and are compelling her to that from <lb/>
            -which her nature and constitution is averse. But it seems <lb/>
            to me that some opposing deity counteracts my measures, <lb/>
            and is fighting against my ministers; wherefore it is neces­ <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            sary that 1 should see the fillet which you told me was ex­ <lb/>
            posed with your daughter, and which you had preserved <lb/>
            with the other tokens: I fear it may contain some witcheries <lb/>
            and magic which work upon her mind, the contrivance of <lb/>
            an enemy, who wishes her to continue all her life single, <lb/>
            childless, and averse to love.' Charicles assented to what <lb/>
            I said, and presently brought me the fillet. I begged and <lb/>
            obtained time to consider it. I took it eagerly with me to <lb/>
            my apartment, and began immediately to read what was <lb/>
            written on it. The characters were Æthiopian;* not the <lb/>
            common ones, but such as those of royal birth make use of, <lb/>
            which are the same as the sacred writings of the Egyptians; <lb/>
            and this was the tenor of the inscription :—</p>
          <p>“‘ Persinn, Queen of Æthiopia, inscribes this, her lament, <lb/>
            as a last gift to an unfortunate daughter, who has not yet <lb/>
            obtained a name, and is known to her only by the pangs she <lb/>
            cost.’</p>
          <p>" I shuddered, Cnemon, when I read the name of Persina; <lb/>
            however, I read on as follows:­</p>
          <p>“‘ I call the Sun to witness, the author of my race, that I <lb/>
            do not expose you, my child, and withdraw you from the <lb/>
            sight of your father Hydaspes, on account of any crime of <lb/>
            mine. Yet I would willingly excuse myself to you, if you <lb/>
            should happen to survive, and to him who shall take you up, <lb/>
            if propitious providence vouchsafes to send you a preserver, <lb/>
            and relate to the world the cause of my exposing you.</p>
          <p>“‘4 Of the gods we count the Sun and Bacchus among our <lb/>
            ancestors; of the heroes, Perseus, Andromeda, and Memnon. <lb/>
            Our kings, at various times, have adorned the royal apart­ <lb/>
            ments with pictures of them and their exploits; some <lb/>
            ornamented the porticoes and men's apartments: our <lb/>
            bed-chamber was painted with the story of Perseus and <lb/>
            Andromeda. There, in the tenth year after our marriage, <lb/>
            when as yet we had no child, I retired to repose myself <lb/>
            during the scorching heat of noon; and here your father, <lb/>
            Hydaspes, visited me, being warned to do so by a dream. <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γράμμαιν Αἰθιοπικι̃ς οὐ ο̑ημοτικοι̃ς</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">αλλὰ Βασιλικοι̃ς</foreign>. “This <lb/>
            distinction,” observes a reviewer, "between the royal and popular <lb/>

            of the king within a circle or oval,is borrowed from the monuments of <lb/>
            Egypt." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            In consequence of this visit I became pregnant. The whole <lb/>
            time of my pregnancy was a continual feast, a course of <lb/>
            sacrifices and thanksgivings to the gods, for the near pros­ <lb/>
            pect, long wished for, of a successor to the kingdom.- But <lb/>
            when at last I brought you forth, a white infant, so different <lb/>
            from the Æthiopian hue, I was at no loss to explain the <lb/>
            cause, since, in the embraces of your fatner,† I had kept my <lb/>
            eyes fixed on the picture of Andromeda, whom the painter had <lb/>
            represented just unchained from the rock, and my imagina­ <lb/>
            tion had communicated her complexion to my unhappy off­ <lb/>
            spring. But this, though satisfactory to me, might not <lb/>
            have been so to any one else. I dreaded the being accused <lb/>
            of adultery, and the punishment which awaits that crime: <lb/>
            I committed you, therefore, to the wide world and to for­ <lb/>
            tune. I thought this better even for you than death, or the <lb/>
            disgrace of being called a bastard, one of which fates must <lb/>
            have awaited you, had I preserved you at home. I told my <lb/>
            husband that my child was dead, and exposed you privately, <lb/>
            placing as many valuables with you as I could collect, by <lb/>
            way of reward for whoever should find and bring you up. <lb/>
            Among other ornaments I put this fillet upon you, stained <lb/>
            with my own blood and containing this melancholy account, <lb/>
            which I have traced out in the midst of tears and sorrows, <lb/>
            when I first brought you into the world, and was over­ <lb/>
            whelmed with grief and consternation. And, oh my sweet, <lb/>
            yet soon lost daughter, if you should survive, remember the <lb/>
            noble race from which you spring; honour and cultivate <lb/>
            virtue and modesty, the chief recommendations of a woman, <lb/>
            and ornaments of a queen. But, among the jew els which <lb/>
            are exposed with you, remember to inquire after, and claim <lb/>
            for yourself a ring which your father gave me when he <note type="footnote"> * Tasso, c. xii. 21-40, as is well known, has introduced the story of <lb/>

            sought me in marriage. The circle of it is inscribed with <lb/>
            royal characters, and in its bezil* the stone Pantarbë, which <lb/>
            possesses occult and powerful virtue. I have given you this <lb/>
            account in writing, since cruel fortune denies me the hap­ <lb/>
            piness of doing it in person; my pains may have been <lb/>
            taken to no purpose, but they may be of use to you; the <lb/>
            designs of fate are inscrutable by mortals. These words <lb/>
            (oh vainly beautiful, and bringing, by your beauty, an impu­ <lb/>
            tation on her who bore you), if you should be preserved, <lb/>
            may serve as a token to discover your race; if otherwise <lb/>
            (which may I never hear!) they will be the funeral lament <lb/>
            of an afflicted mother.'</p>
          <p>“When I read this, Cnemon, I acknowledged and <lb/>
            wondered at the dispensations of the deities. I felt both <lb/>
            pleasure and pain by a new kind of sensation; I rejoiced <lb/>
            and wept at the same time. I was glad to have discovered <lb/>
            what 1 was before ignorant of, together with the meaning of <lb/>
            the oracle: but I was apprehensive for the event of the <lb/>
            design I was engaged in ; and lamented the instability and <lb/>
            uncertainty, the changes and the chances of human life, of <lb/>
            which the fortunes of Charielea afforded so remarkable an <lb/>
            instance. I recollected that, with her high birth, heiress of <lb/>
            the royal family of Æthiopia, she was now banished to a <lb/>
            vast distance from her native country, and reputed as <lb/>
            a bastard. I continued a considerable time in these con­ <lb/>
            templations, deploring her present situation, and hardly <lb/>
            daring to flatter myself with better hopes for the future. <lb/>
            At length I collected my scattered spirits, and determined <lb/>
            that something must be done, and that quickly. I went, <lb/>
            therefore, to Chariclea; I found her alone, almost overcome <lb/>
            by what she suffered: her mind willing to bear up against <lb/>
            her malady; but her body labouring, yielding, and unable <lb/>
            to resist its attacks. When I had sent out her attendants, <lb/>
            and given orders that no one should disturb us, on pretence <lb/>
            that I had some prayers and invocations to make use of <lb/>
            over her, I thus addressed her:</p>
          <p>" 'It is now time, my dear Chariclea, to disclose to me (as <lb/>
            you promised yesterday) the cause of your sufferings. Hide <lb/>
            nothing, I beseech you, from a man who has the greatest <lb/>
            regard for you; and whose art is besides able to discover <lb/>
            whatever you may obstinately endeavour to conceal.'—She <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="90"/>
              took my hand, kissed it and wept. ‘Sage Calasiria,’ said <lb/>
              she, ‘ permit me, I beg of you, to suffer in silence ; and do <lb/>
              you, as you have it in your power, discover of yourself the <lb/>
              cause of my disease. Spare me the ignominy of confessing <lb/>
              that which it is shameful to feel, and still more shameful to <lb/>
              avow. Whatever I undergo from my disorder, I suffer <lb/>
              more from the thought of my own weakness, in permitting <lb/>
              thyself to be overcome by it, and not resisting it at the be­ <lb/>
              ginning. It was always odious to me ; the very mention of <lb/>
              it contaminates the chaste ears of a virgin.'</p>
          <p>“‘ I acquiesce, my daughter,' I replied, ‘ in your silence. <lb/>
            I do not blame your reserve, and that for two reasons. In <lb/>
            the first place, I have no need to be told that which I have <lb/>
            before discovered by my art; and then an unwillingness to <lb/>
            speak of a matter of this nature, becomes well the modesty <lb/>
            of your sex. But since you have at last felt love, and are <lb/>
            manifestly smitten by Theagenes (for this the gods have <lb/>
            disclosed to me), know that you are not the first, or the only <lb/>
            one, who has succumbed under this passion. It is common <lb/>
            to you with many celebrated women, and many maidens in <lb/>
            other respects most irreproachable ; for love is a very power­ <lb/>
            ful deity, and is said to subdue even the gods. themselves. <lb/>
            Consider then what is best to be done in your present cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances. If it be the greatest happiness to be free from <lb/>
            love, the next is, when one is taken captive, to regulate it <lb/>
            properly : this you have in your power to do ; you can repel <lb/>
            the imputation of mere sensual love, and sanctify it with the <lb/>
            honourable and sacred name of wedlock.'</p>
          <p>" When I said this, Cnemon, she showed much agitation, <lb/>
            and great drops of sweat stood on her forehead. It was <lb/>
            plain that she rejoiced at what she heard, but was anxious <lb/>
            about the success of her hopes ; and ashamed and blushing <lb/>
            at the discovery of her weakness. After a considerable <lb/>
            pause sho said,</p>
          <p>It ‘ You talk of wedlock, and recommend that, as if it were <lb/>
            evident that my father would agree to it, or the author of <lb/>
            my sufferings desire it.'—‘ As to the young man, I have not <note type="footnote">“ His hands are tiny, but afar they throw, <lb/>

            he least doubt; he is more deeply smitten than yourself, <lb/>
            and suffers full as much on your account as yon can do on <lb/>
            his. For, as it seems, your souls at their first encountering <lb/>
            knew that they were worthy of each other, and felt a mutual- <lb/>
            passion ; this passion, out of regard to you, I have height­ <lb/>
            ened by my art in Theagenes. But he whom you suppose <lb/>
            your father, proposes to give you another husband, Alca­ <lb/>
            menes, whom you well know.'—‘ He shall sooner find Alca­ <lb/>
            menes a grave, than find him a wife in me,' said she; ‘either <lb/>
            Theagenes shall be my husband, or I will yield to the fate <lb/>
            which presses upon me. But why do you hint that Cha­ <lb/>
            ricles is not really my father ?'</p>
          <p>“‘ It is from this that I have my information,' I replied, <lb/>
            shewing her the fillet.—‘Where did you get this?' said <lb/>
            she, ‘ or how P for since I was brought, I hardly know how, <lb/>
            from Egypt, Charicles has kept it safely locked up in a chest <lb/>
            lest any accident should happen to it.'—‘ How I got it,' I <lb/>
            returned, you shall hear another time ; at present tell me <lb/>
            if you know what is written on it.'—She owned that she <lb/>
            was entirely ignorant of its contents.—‘ It discovers,' said I, <lb/>
            ‘ your family, your country, and your fortunes.'—She be­ <lb/>
            sought me to disclose the purport of it; and I interpreted <lb/>
            the whole writing to her, word for word. When she came <lb/>
            to know who she was, her spirit seemed to rise, in conformity <lb/>
            to her noble race. She asked me what was to be done at this <lb/>
            conjuncture. I then became more unreserved and explicit <lb/>
            in my advice to her.</p>
          <p>“ ‘ I have been, my daughter,‘ said I, ‘ in Ethiopia; led <lb/>
            by the desire of making myself acquainted with their ,,-is­ <lb/>
            dome I was known to your mother Persina, for the royal <lb/>
            palace was always open to the learned. I acquired some <lb/>
            reputation there, as I increased my own stock of Egyptian <lb/>
            knowledge by joining it to that of Ethiopia: and when I <lb/>
            was preparing to return home, the queen unbosomed herself <lb/>
            to me, and disclosed everything she knew relative to you, <lb/>
            and your birth, exacting from me first an oath of secrecy. <lb/>
            She said she was afraid to confide in any of the Æthiopian <lb/>
            sages; and she earnestly besought me to consult the gods. <lb/>
            as to whether you had been fortunately preserved; and if <lb/>
            so, into what part of the world you were: for she could <lb/>
            hear no tidings of you in .Ethiopia, after a most diligent <lb/>
            inquiry. The goodness of the gods discovered by their <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            oracles everything to me: and when I told her you were <lb/>
            still alive, and where you were, she was very earnest with <lb/>
            me to seek you out, and induce you to return to your native <lb/>
            land; for she had continued sorrowful and childless ever <lb/>
            since you were exposed; and was ready, if you should ap­ <lb/>
            pear, to confess to her husband everything which had hap­ <lb/>
            pened. And she was inclined to hope that he would now <lb/>
            acknowledge you; having had so long experience of her <lb/>
            virtue and good conduct, and seeing an unexpected prospect <lb/>
            arise of a successor to his family. This she said, and be­ <lb/>
            sought me earnestly by the Sun, an adjuration which no sago <lb/>
            dare violate, to do what she desired of me. I am now here, <lb/>
            desirous to execute what I have been so strongly conjured <lb/>
            to do: and though another cause brought me into this <lb/>
            country, I esteem the pains of my wandering well repaid ; <lb/>
            and give thanks to the gods that I have found you here, <lb/>
            whom I have long been desirous of meeting with. You <lb/>
            know with what care I have cultivated your friendship— <lb/>
            that I concealed whatever I knew concerning you, till I <lb/>
            could obtain possession of this fillet, as a pledge of the truth <lb/>
            of my relation. You may now, if you will bo persuaded, <lb/>
            leave this country with me, before you are obliged, by force, <lb/>
            to do anything against your inclinations; for I know that <lb/>
            Charicles is taking every measure to bring about your mar­ <lb/>
            riage with Alcamenes. You may return to your country, <lb/>
            revisit your family, and be restored to your parents accom­ <lb/>
            panied by Theagenes, your intended husband ; and you may <lb/>
            change your life of exile and uncertainty for that of a <lb/>
            princess, loves, who shall hereafter reign with him whom she most <lb/>
            loves, if we may place confidence in the predictions of the <lb/>
            gods. I then put her in mind of the oracle of Apollo, and <lb/>
            gave her my explanation of it. She had heard of it before, <lb/>
            for it was much talked of, and its meaning inquired into <lb/>
            She paused at this: at last she said, ' Since such, you think, <lb/>
            is the will of the gods, and I am inclined to believe your <lb/>
            interpretation, what, Father, will be best for me to do ?'— <lb/>
            ‘ You must pretend,' said I, ‘ that you are willing to marry <lb/>
            Alcalnenes.'—‘ But this is odious to me,' she replied; ' it is <lb/>
            disgraceful to give even a feigned promise to any but Thea­ <lb/>
            genes : but since I have given myself up to your direction, <lb/>
            and that of the gods, how far will tins dissimulation lead <lb/>
            me, so that I be not entangled in any disagreeable circum­ <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            stances by it P’—‛ The event will show you,’ said I; 'to <lb/>
            tell you beforehand might cause some hesitation upon your <lb/>
            part, whereas suddenness in action will bring with it conn. <lb/>
            dence and boldness. Only follow my advice: seem, for the <lb/>
            present, to agree to the marriage which Charicles has so <lb/>
            much at heart; he will not proceed in it without my know­ <lb/>
            ledge and direction.' She wept, yet promised to be guided <lb/>
            by me, and I took my leave of her.</p>
          <p>" I had scarcely got out of the chamber when I met <lb/>
            Charicles, with a very downcast and sorrowful air.—‛You <lb/>
            are a strange man,' said I: ‛ when you ought to rejoice, <lb/>
            sacrifice, and give thanks to the gods, for having obtained <lb/>
            what you so long have wished for; when Chariclea at last, <lb/>
            with great difficulty, and the utmost exertions of my art <lb/>
            and wisdom, has been brought to yield to love, and to desire <lb/>
            marriage; you go about sad and drooping, and are ready to <lb/>
            shed tears. What can be the matter with you ?’-‛ I have <lb/>
            but too much reason for sorrow,' he replied, ‛when the de­ <lb/>
            light of my eyes, before she can be married, as you say silo <lb/>
            is inclined to be, is threatened to be hurried away from me, <lb/>
            if any faith is to be given to dreams, which on several nights, <lb/>
            and particularly on the last, have tormented me. Me­ <lb/>
            thought I saw an eagle take his flight from the hand of <lb/>
            Apollo, and stooping down suddenly upon me, snatch my <lb/>
            daughter, alas ! out of my very bosom, and bear her away to <lb/>
            some extreme corner of the earth, full of dusky and shadowy <lb/>
            forms. I could not discover what became of them; for soon <lb/>
            the vast intermediate interval hid them from my sight.’ <lb/>
            I instantly conjectured what this dream portended; but I <lb/>
            endeavoured to comfort him, and to prevent his having the <lb/>
            smallest suspicion of the real truth. ‛ Considering that you <lb/>
            are a priest,' I said, ‛ and are dedicated to that deity who <lb/>
            is most famous for oracles, you seem to me not to have <lb/>
            much skill in the interpretation of dreams. This darkly <lb/>
            signifies the approaching marriage of your child, and the <lb/>
            eagle represents her intended spouse: and when Apollo <lb/>
            intimates this to you, and that it is from his hands that your <lb/>
            daughter is to receive a husband, you seem displeased, and <lb/>
            wrest the dream to an ominous interpretation. Wherefore, <lb/>
            my dear Charicles, let us be cautious what we say; let us <lb/>
            accommodate ourselves to the will of the gods, and use our <lb/>
            utmost endeavours to persuade the maiden.'</p><pb n="94"/>
            
          <p>“ ‛ But how shall we manage,' be replied, ‛to render her <lb/>
            more compliant P’ —‛ Have you,’ said I, ‛ any valuables <lb/>
            laid up in store, garments, or gold, or necklace P if you <lb/>
            have, produce them, give them to her as a marriage present, <lb/>
            and propitiate her by gifts. Precious stones and orna­ <lb/>
            ments have a magic * influence upon a female mind. You <lb/>
            must proceed too, as fast as you can, in all your prepa­ <lb/>
            rations for the nuptials; there must be no delay in hastening <lb/>
            them forward, while that inclination, forced upon her mind <lb/>
            by art, remains yet undiminished.’—‛ Nothing shall be want­ <lb/>
            ing which depends upon me,’ replied Charicles ; and imme­ <lb/>
            diately he ran out, with alacrity and joy, to put his words in <lb/>
            execution. I soon found that he lost no time in doing what <lb/>
            I had suggested; and that he had offered to Chariclea <lb/>
            dresses of great price, and the Ethiopian necklace which <lb/>
            had been exposed with her as tokens by Persina, as if they <lb/>
            were marriage presents from Alcamenes.—Soon after I met <lb/>
            Theagenes, and asked him what was become of all those who <lb/>
            had composed his train in the procession.—He said the <lb/>
            maidens had already set forward on their journey, as they <lb/>
            travelled slowly; and that the youths, impatient of delay, <lb/>
            were becoming clamorous, and pressing him to return home. <lb/>
            When I heard this, I instructed him what to say to them, <lb/>
            and what he should do himself; and bidding him observe <lb/>
            the signals that I should give him, both of time and oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, I left hint.</p>
          <p>" 1 bent my course towards the temple of Apollo, intend­ <lb/>
            ing to implore him to instruct me, by some oracle, in what <lb/>
            manner I was to direct my flight with my young friends. <lb/>
            But the divinity was quicker than any thought of mine—he <lb/>
            assists those who act in conformity to his will, and with <lb/>
            unasked benevolence anticipates their prayers; as he here <lb/>
            . anticipated my question by a voluntary oracle, and in a very <lb/>
            evident manner manifested his superintendence over us. <lb/>
            For as I was hastening, full of anxiety, to his shrine, a <lb/>
            sudden voice stopped me-‛ Make what speed you can,' it <note type="footnote"> * ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ύγγα</foreign>. Properly the bird called the “ wryneck." It was sacred to <lb/>
            Venus, and much used in love incantations, especially to recall the <lb/>
            alienated affections of a beloved object. It was employed fastened to <lb/>
            a wheel, by turning which, the effect was supposed to be produced.. <lb/>
            It also means the magical wheel itself.—Hickie's Theocritus, see <lb/>
            Theoc. Idyll. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            said; ‛ the strangers call upon you.’-A company of people <lb/>
            were at that time celebrating, to the sound of flutes, a fes­ <lb/>
            tival in honour of Hercules. I obeyed, and turned towards <lb/>
            them, as soon as I heard this warning, careful not to neglect <lb/>
            the divine call. I joined the assembly, I threw incense on <lb/>
            the altar, and made my libations of water. They ironically <lb/>
            expressed their admiration at the cost and profusion of my <lb/>
            offerings, and invited me to partake of the feast with them. <lb/>
            I accepted the invitation, and having reclined on a couch <lb/>
            adorned with myrtle and laurel, and tasted something of <lb/>
            what was set before me, I said to them, " My friends, I <lb/>
            have partaken of a very pleasant entertainment with you, <lb/>
            but I am ignorant whom I am among; wherefore it is time <lb/>
            now for you to tell me who you are, and from whence : for <lb/>
            it is rude and unbecoming for those who have begun a kind <lb/>
            of friendship, by being partakers of the same table and <lb/>
            sacrifice, and of the same sacred salt, to separate without <lb/>
            knowing at least something of each other.’—They readily <lb/>
            replied that they were Phœnician merchants from Tyre <lb/>
            that they were sailing to Carthago with a cargo of Æthio­ <lb/>
            pian, Indian, and Phœnician merchandize—that they were <lb/>
            at that instant celebrating a sacrifice to the Tyrian Her­ <lb/>
            cules, on account of a victory which that young man <lb/>
            (showing one of their company) had gained at the Pythian <lb/>
            games; esteeming it a great honour that it Phœnician <lb/>
            should bo declared a conqueror in Greece. This youth, <lb/>
            said they, after we had passed the Malian promontory, and <lb/>
            were driven by contrary winds to Cephallene, affirmed to <lb/>
            us, swearing by this our country's god, that it was revealed <lb/>
            to him in a dream that he should obtain a prize at the <lb/>
            Pythian games; and persuaded us to turn out of our course, <lb/>
            and touch here. In effect, his presages have been fulfilled ; <lb/>
            and the head of a merchant is now encircled with a victor's <lb/>
            crown, He offers therefore this sacrifice to the god who <lb/>
            foretold his success, both as a thanksgiving for the vic­ <lb/>
            tory, and to implore his protection in the voyage which <lb/>
            we are about to undertake; for we propose to set sail early <lb/>
            to-morrow morning, if the winds favour our wishes.’</p>
          <p>" ‛ Is that really your intention ?' I said.-‛ It is indeed,' <lb/>
            they answered.—‛ You may then,' I replied, ' have me as <lb/>
            a companion in your voyage, if you will permit it; for <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            I have occasion to go into Sicily, and in your course tc <lb/>
            Africa you must necessarily sail by that island.' —‛ You <lb/>
            shall be heartily welcome,' they replied; ‛ for nothing but <lb/>
            good can happen to us from the society of a sage, a Grecian, <lb/>
            and, as we conjecture, a favourite of the gods.’—‛ I shall <lb/>
            be very happy to accept your offer,' I said, ‛ if you will <lb/>
            allow me one day for preparation.' — ‛Well,’ said they, <lb/>
            ‛ we will give you to-morrow; but do not fail in the <lb/>
            evening to be by the water-side; for the night is favour­ <lb/>
            able to our navigation; gentle breezes at that season <lb/>
            blow from the land, and propel the ship quietly on her way.’</p>
          <p>“I promised them to be there without fail at the time <lb/>
            appointed, and exacted an oath from them that they would <lb/>
            not sail before. And with this I left them, still employed in <lb/>
            their pipes and dances, which they performed to the brisk <lb/>
            notes ot their music, something after the Assyrian fashion ; <lb/>
            now bounding lightly on high,. and now sinking to the <lb/>
            ground on bended knees, and again whirling themselves <lb/>
            round with rapidity, as if hurried on by the influence of the <lb/>
            divinity. I found Chariclea admiring as they lay in her <lb/>
            lap the presents which Charicles had made her; from her I <lb/>
            went to Theagenes: I gave each of them instructions what <lb/>
            they were to do, and returned to my apartment, solicitous <lb/>
            and intent upon the prosecution of my design ; which I did <lb/>
            not long delay to put in execution. When it was midnight, <lb/>
            and all the city was buried in sleep, a band of armed youths <lb/>
            surrounded the habitation of Chariclea. Theagenes led on <lb/>
            this amatory assault: his troop consisted of those who cOIn. <lb/>
            posed his train. With shouts, and clamour, and clashing <lb/>
            their shields, to terrify any who might be within hearing, <lb/>
            they broke into the house with lighted torches ;† the door, <note type="footnote"> * Mr. Hobhouse's description of the dance of the Albanians affords <lb/>
            an illustration of the above. " They danced round the blaze to their <lb/>
            own songs with astonishing energy-one of them which detained <lb/>
            them more than an hour, had for the burden-‛ Robbers all at Parga ! <lb/>
            Robbers all at Parga !’ and as they roared out this stave, they <lb/>
            whirled round the fire, dropped and rebounded from their knees, and <lb/>
            again whirled round as the chorus was again repeated.”—Notes to <lb/>

            which had on purpose been left slightly fastened, easily <lb/>
            giving way to them. They seized and hurried away Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea, who was apprized of their design, and easily sub­ <lb/>
            mitted to the seeming violence. They took with her a <lb/>
            quantity of valuable stuff, which she indicated to them; and <lb/>
            the moment they had left the house, they raised again their <lb/>
            warlike shouts, clashed their shields, and with an awful <lb/>
            noise marched through the city, to the unspeakable terror <lb/>
            of the affrighted inhabitants ; whose alarm was the greater, <lb/>
            as they had chosen a still night for their purpose, and Par­ <lb/>
            nassus resounded to the clang of their brazen bucklers. In <lb/>
            this manner they passed through Delphi, frequently re­ <lb/>
            peating to each other the name of Chariclea. As soon as <lb/>
            they were out of the city, they galloped as fast as they could <lb/>
            towards Mount Œta. Here the lovers, as had been agreed <lb/>
            upon, withdrew themselves privately from the Thessalians, <lb/>
            and fled to me. They fell at my feet, embraced my knees in <lb/>
            great agitation, and called upon me to save them; Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea blushing, with downcast eyes, at the bold step she had <lb/>
            taken. Preserve and protect, said Theagenes, ‛strangers, <lb/>
            fugitives, and suppliants, who have given up everything that <lb/>
            they may gain each other; slaves of chaste love; playthings <lb/>
            of fortune; voluntary exiles, yet not despairing, but placing <lb/>
            all their hopes of safety in you.' I was confused and <lb/>
            affected with this address: tears would have been a relief to <lb/>
            me; but I restrained myself, that I might not increase their <lb/>
            apprehensions. I raised and comforted them; and bidding <lb/>
            them hope everything which was fortunate, from a design <lb/>
            undertaken under the direction of the gods, I told them I <lb/>
            must go and look after what yet remained to be done for <lb/>
            the execution of our project; and desiring them to stay <lb/>
            where they were, and to take great care that they were not <lb/>
            seen by any body, I prepared to leave them; but Chariclea <lb/>
            caught hold of my garment, and detained me.</p>
          <p>“ ‛ Father,' she cried, ‛ it will be treacherous and unjust <lb/>
            in you to leave me already, and alone, under the care of <lb/>
            Theagenes only. You do not consider how faithless a <lb/>
            guardian a lover is, when his mistress is in his power, and <lb/>
            no one present to impose respect upon him. He will with <lb/>
            difficulty restrain himself, when he sees the object of his <lb/>
            ardent desires defenceless before him; wherefore I insist upon <note type="footnote"> II </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            your not leaving me, till I have exacted an oath from Theage­ <lb/>
            nes, that he will not attempt to obtain any favours which I am <lb/>
            Dot disposed to grant, till I arrive in my country, and am re­ <lb/>
            stored to my family; or, at least, if the gods should envy me <lb/>
            that happiness, till I am by my own consent become his wife.'</p>
          <p>“ ‘I was surprised yet pleased with what she said, and <lb/>
            agreed entirely with her in her sentiments. I raised a <lb/>
            flame upon the hearth in place of an altar, threw on a few <lb/>
            grains of frankincense, and Theagenes took the oath, indig­ <lb/>
            nant at its being required of him, and that such an obli­ <lb/>
            gation should deprive him of showing voluntarily that <lb/>
            respect to Chariclea, which he was already determined to <lb/>
            show without any such compulsion. He should now, he <lb/>
            said, have no merit in it; all the restraint he put upon him­ <lb/>
            self would be imputed to the fear of perjury.. He swore. <lb/>
            however, by the Pythian Apollo, by Diana, by Venus her­ <lb/>
            self, and the Loves, that he would conform himself in every <lb/>
            instance to the will of Chariclea. These and other solemn <lb/>
            vows having been mutually taken under the auspices of the <lb/>
            gods, I made what haste I could to Charicles.</p>
          <p>" I found his house full of tumult and grief, his servants <lb/>
            having already informed him of the rape of his daughter; <lb/>
            his friends flocking round him with useless consolation, and <lb/>
            equally useless advice; himself in tears, and totally at a <lb/>
            loss what to do. I called out with a loud voice, ‘Knaves <lb/>
            that you are, how long will you stand here stupid and unde­ <lb/>
            termined, as if your misfortunes had taken away your <lb/>
            senses ? Why do you not arm instantly, pursue and take <lb/>
            the ravishers, and revenge the injuries you have received ?' <lb/>
            —‘ It will be to no purpose,' replied Charicles, in a languid <lb/>
            tone ; 'I see that all this is come upon me by the wrath of <lb/>
            heaven; the gods foretold to me that I should be deprived <lb/>
            of what I held most dear, since the time that I entered <lb/>
            unseasonably into the temple, and saw what it was not <note type="footnote"> “I swear to thee, by Cupid'a strongest bow, <lb/>

            lawful for me to behold.. Yet there is no reason why we <lb/>
            should not contend, in this instance, even against a cala­ <lb/>
            mity, though sent by the deities, if we knew whom we have <lb/>
            to pursue, and who have brought this misfortune upon us.' <lb/>
            ‘We do know them,' said I; ‘ it is Theagenes, whom you <lb/>
            made so much of and introduced to me, and his compa­ <lb/>
            nions. Perhaps you may find some of them still about the <lb/>
            city, who may have loitered here this evening. Arise, <lb/>
            therefore, and call the people to council.'</p>
          <p>“What I desired was done: the magistrates sent the <lb/>
            herald about, to convoke an assembly by the sound of <lb/>
            trumpet. The people presently came together, and a <lb/>
            night meeting was held in the theatre. Charicles drew <lb/>
            tears of compassion from all, when he appeared in the midst <lb/>
            in mourning garments, with dust upon his face and head, <lb/>
            and thus began:</p>
          <p>“‘Delphians, you may perhaps imagine that I have called <lb/>
            together this meeting, and am now addressing it solely on <lb/>
            account of my own great calamities; but that is not entirely <lb/>
            the case. I suffer indeed what is worse than death. I am <lb/>
            left deserted, afflicted by the gods, my house desolate, and <lb/>
            deprived of that sweet conversation which I preferred to all <lb/>
            the pleasures in the world; yet hope, and the self-conceit <lb/>
            common to us, still sustains me, and promises me that I <lb/>
            shall again recover my daughter. But I am moved with <lb/>
            indignation at the affront which has been offered to the <lb/>
            city, which I hope to see punished even before my own <lb/>
            wrongs are redressed, unless the Thessainn striplings have <lb/>
            taken away from us our free spirit, and just regard for our <lb/>
            country and its gods; for what can be more shameful than <lb/>
            that a few youths, dancers forsooth, and followers of an <lb/>
            embassy, should trample under their feet the laws and <lb/>
            authority of the first city in Greece, and should ravish from <lb/>
            the temple of Apollo its chiefest ornament, Chariclea, alas ! <note type="footnote"> * Charicles does not farther explain the nature of his offence ; but <lb/>
            the ancients thought that even an accidental, involuntary intrusion <lb/>
            into any ceremonies or mysteries at which it was not lawful for the <lb/>
            intruder to be present, was always followed by some punishment. <lb/>

            the delight of my eyes; How obstinate and implacable <lb/>
            towards me has been the anger of the gods! The life of my <lb/>
            own daughter, as you know, was extinguished with the light <lb/>
            of her nuptial torches. Grief for her death brought her <lb/>
            mother soon to the grave, and drove me from my country; <lb/>
            but, when I found Chariclea, I felt myself consoled; she <lb/>
            became my life, the hope of succession in my family, my <lb/>
            sheet anchor, I may say, my only comfort. Of all these <lb/>
            this sudden storm has bereft me, and that at the most <lb/>
            unlucky time possible, as if I were to be the scorn and <lb/>
            sport of fate, just when preparations were making for her <lb/>
            marriage, and you were all informed of it.’</p>
          <p>“ While he was speaking, and indulging himself in lamen­ <lb/>
            tations, the chief magistrate Hegesias interrupted and stop­ <lb/>
            ped him. Let Charicles, fellow-citizens, said he, 'lament <lb/>
            hereafter at his leisure; but let not us be so hurried away, <lb/>
            and affected by concern for his misfortunes, as to neglect <lb/>
            opportunity, which in all things is of great moment, and <lb/>
            particularly in military affairs.. There is some hope that <lb/>
            we may overtake the ravishers if we follow them instantly, <lb/>
            for the delay which must take place on our part will <lb/>
            naturally make them less speedy in their march: but if we <lb/>
            spend our time in womanish bewailings,and by our delays give <lb/>
            them an opportunity to escape, what remains but that we <lb/>
            shall become a common laughing-stock, the laughing-stock <lb/>
            of youths, whom the moment we have taken we should nail <lb/>
            to so many crosses, and render their names, and even their <lb/>
            families, infamous? This we may easily effect, if we en­ <lb/>
            deavour to rouse the indignation of their countrymen against <lb/>
            them, and interdict their descendants, and as many of them­ <lb/>
            selves as may happen to escape, from ever being present at <lb/>
            this annual ceremonial and sacrifice to the Manes of their <lb/>
            hero; tho expense of which we defray out of our public <lb/>
            treasury.' The people approved what he advised, and rati­ <lb/>
            fled it by their decree. ‘ Enact, also,' said he, ‘ if you <lb/>
            please, that the priestess shall never in future appear to <lb/>

            therefore, to guard against anything which may give occa­ <lb/>
            sion to such an attempt for the time to come.’</p>
          <p>“ When this also was unanimously agreed to, Hegesias <lb/>
            gave the signal to march, the trumpet sounded, the theatre <lb/>
            was abandoned for war, and there was a general rush from <lb/>
            the assembly for the fight. Not only the robust and <lb/>
            mature followed him, but children and youths likewise, <lb/>
            supplying with their zeal the place of age ;women, also, <lb/>
            with a spirit superior to their strength, snatching what <lb/>
            arms they could meet with, tried in vain to keep up <lb/>
            with them, and, by the fruitless attempt, were obliged <lb/>
            to confess the weakness of their sex. You might see old <lb/>
            men struggling with their age, their mind dragging on <lb/>
            their body, and indignant at their physical weakness, <lb/>
            because of the vigour of their minds. The whole city, in <lb/>
            short, felt so deeply the loss of Chariclea, that, without <lb/>
            waiting for day, and moved by a common impulse, it <lb/>
            poured forth in pursuit of her ravishers."</p>

          <p>It How the city of Delphos succeeded in their pursuit, I <lb/>
            had no opportunity of learning; their being thus engaged, <lb/>
            however, gave me an excellent opportunity for the flight <lb/>
            which I meditated. Taking, therefore, my young com­ <lb/>
            panions, I led them down to the sea, and put them aboard <lb/>
            the Phœnician vessel, which was just ready to set sail, for <lb/>
            day now beginning to break, the merchants thought they <lb/>
            had kept the promise they had made, of waiting for me a <lb/>
            day and a night. Seeing us however appear, they received <lb/>
            us with great joy, and immediately proceeded out of the <lb/>
            harbour, at first using their oars, then a moderate breeze <lb/>
            rising from the land, and a gentle swell of the sea* caressing <figure type="illustration">

            and the Oxian isles, sharp* both in name and figure, and <lb/>
            the sea of Zacynthus began to appear as the sun sank <lb/>
            towards the west. But why am I thus tedious? Why <lb/>
            do I forget you and myself, and, by extending my narration, <lb/>
            embark you upon a boundless ocean. Let us stop here <lb/>
            a while, and both of us take a little rest; for though I <lb/>
            know you are a very patient hearer, and strive excellently <lb/>
            against sleep, yet I have prosecuted the account of my <lb/>
            troubles to so unseasonable an hour, that I think you at <lb/>
            last begin to give in. My age, too, and the remembrance of <lb/>
            my sufferings, weigh down my spirits, and require repose.'</p>
          <p>" Stop then, Father," replied Cnemon, " not on my <lb/>
            account, for I could attend untircd to your story many <lb/>
            days and nights ;it is to me as the noise strains; but I <lb/>
            have for some time heard a tumult and noise in the house ; <lb/>
            I was rather alarmed at it, but my great desire to hear the <lb/>
            remainder of your discourse prevented me from interrupting <lb/>
            you.”</p>
          <p>“ I was not sensible of it," said Calasiris, “owing, I <lb/>
            suppose, partly to the dulness of my hearing, the common <lb/>
            malady of age, and partly to my being intent on what I <lb/>
            was saying. But I fancy the stir you bear is occasioned <lb/>
            by the return of Nausicles, the master of the house; I DID <lb/>
            impatient to know how he has succeeded.—‘In every thing <lb/>
            as I could wish, my dear Calasiris,' said Nausicles, who <lb/>
            entered at that moment. ‘I know how solicitous you were <lb/>
            for my success, and how your best wishes accompanied me. <lb/>
            I have many proofs of your good will towards me, and <lb/>
            among others the words which I have just heard you <lb/>
            uttering. But who is this stranger?’—‘A Greek,' said <lb/>
            Calasiris; ‘ what farther regards him you shall hear another <lb/>
            time; but pray relate to us your success, that we may be <lb/>
            partakers in your joy.' ' You shall hear all in the morning,’ <lb/>
            replied Nausicles; ‘;at present let it suffice you to know, <lb/>
            that I have obtained a fairer Thisbe than ever; for myself, <lb/>
            wearied with cares and fatigues, I must now take a little <lb/>
            repose.’ Having said this, he retired to rest. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig22.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="103"/>
              </p>
          <p>Cnemon was struck at bearing the name of Thisbe; <lb/>
            racking his mind with anxiety, he passed a sleepless night, <lb/>
            nor could he at intervals restrain his sighs and groans, <lb/>
            which at last awakened Calasiris, who lay near, from a <lb/>
            sound sleep. The old man, raising himself upon his elbow, <lb/>
            nsked him what was the matter with him, and why he <lb/>
            vented his complaints in that almost frantic manner. " Is <lb/>
            it not enough to drive me mad," replied Cnemon, “ when I <lb/>
            hear that Thisbe is alive?”—“And who is this Thisbe ?” <lb/>
            said Calasiris, “ and how came you acquainted with her ? <lb/>
            and why are you disturbed at supposing her to be alive?" <lb/>
            —“ You shall hear at large," returned the other, " when I <lb/>
            relate to you my story; at present I will only tell you that <lb/>
            I saw her dead with these eyes, and buried her with my own <lb/>
            hands among the buccaneers. It " Take some rest now," <lb/>
            said the old man ; " this mystery will soon be cleared up." <lb/>
            -it I cannot sleep," he said; " do you repose yourself if <lb/>
            you will ; I shall die if I do not find out, and that imme­ <lb/>
            diately, under what mistake Nausicles is labouring; or <lb/>
            whether among the Egyptians alone the dead come to life <lb/>
            again.” Calasiris smiled at his impatience, and betook <lb/>
            himself again to sleep.</p>
          <p>But Cnemon arose, and, going out of his chamber, en­ <lb/>
            countered all those difficulties which it was probable a <lb/>
            stranger would meet with, who wanders at night, and in <lb/>
            the dark, in an unknown house; but he struggled with <lb/>
            them all, such was his horror of Thisbe, and his anxiety <lb/>
            to clear away the apprehensions which were raised in his <lb/>
            mind by what fell from Nausicles. After passing and <lb/>
            repassing many times, without knowing it, the same pas­ <lb/>
            sages, at last he heard the soft voice of a woman lamenting, <lb/>
            like a vernal nightingale pouring out her melancholy notes <lb/>
            at eventide.* Led by the sound, he advanced towards the <lb/>
            apartment; and putting his ear to the division of the fold. <lb/>
            ing doors, he listened, and heard her thus lamenting:­ <note type="footnote"> * “ Qualis populeA mœrens Philomela sub umbra <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>What an unhappy fate is mine! I thought I had <lb/>
            escaped from the hands of the robbers, and avoided a cruel <lb/>
            death. I flattered myself that I should pass the remainder <lb/>
            of my life with my beloved; wandering indeed, and in <lb/>
            foreign lands, but with him it would have been sweet; and <lb/>
            every difficulty would have been supportable. But my <lb/>
            evil genius is not yet satisfied; he gave me a glance of <lb/>
            hope, and has plunged me afresh in despair. I hoped I <lb/>
            had escaped servitude, and am again a slave; a prison, and <lb/>
            am still confined. I was kept in an island, and surrounded <lb/>
            with darkness; my situation is not now very different, <lb/>
            indeed, perhaps rather worse, for he who was able and <lb/>
            willing to console me is separated from me. The Pirates' <lb/>
            cave which I yesterday inhabited, seemed indeed an avenue <lb/>
            to the shades below; more like a chrarnel house than a <lb/>
            dwelling; but his presence in whom I delighted made it <lb/>
            pleasant ;for he lamented my fate living, and shed tears <lb/>
            over me when he thought me dead. Now I am deprived of <lb/>
            every comfort; he who partook of and lessened the burden <lb/>
            of my misfortunes is ravished from me; and I, deserted <lb/>
            and a captive, am exposed alone to the assaults of cruel <lb/>
            fortune; and endure to live only because 1 have a glim­ <lb/>
            mering of hope that my beloved still survives. But where, <lb/>
            O delight of my soul, are you? What fate has awaited <lb/>
            you ? Are you also forced to be a slave—you, whose spirit <lb/>
            is so free, and impatient of all slavery except that of love ? <lb/>
            Oh, may your life be safe, at least; and may you, though <lb/>
            late, see again your Thisbe !for so, however unwilling, you <lb/>
            must call me."</p>
          <p>When Cnemon heard this, he could no longer restrain <lb/>
            himself, or have patience to listen to what was to follow; <lb/>
            but guessing from what he had already heard, and particu­ <lb/>
            larly from what was last uttered, that the complainer could <lb/>
            be no other than Thisbe, he was ready to fall into a swoon <lb/>
            at the very doors ; he composed himself, however, as well as <lb/>
            he was able, and fearing lest he should be discovered by any <lb/>
            one (for morning now approached, and the cock had twice <lb/>
            crowed), he hurried back with a tottering pace.</p>
          <p>Now his foot stumbled; now he fell against the wall, <lb/>
            and now against the lintels of the door; sometimes he struck <lb/>
            his head against utensils hanging from the ceiling; at <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            last, with much difficulty, and after many wanderings, he <lb/>
            reached his own apartment, and threw himself upon the <lb/>
            bed. His body trembled, and his teeth chattered, and it <lb/>
            might have become a very serious matter bad not Calasiris, <lb/>
            alarmed at the disorder in which he returned, come to his <lb/>
            assistance, and soothed and comforted him. When he <lb/>
            came a little to himself, lie inquired into the cause of it.</p>
          <p>" I am undone," exclaimed Cnemon ; " that wretch Thisbe <lb/>
            is really olive; It and having said this, he sank down again <lb/>
            and fainted away.</p>
          <p>Calasiris having with much ado recovered him, attempted <lb/>
            to cheer his mind. Some envious demon, who makes human <lb/>
            affairs his sport, was no doubt practising his illusions <lb/>
            upon Cnemon, not suffering him to enjoy his good fortune <lb/>
            unalloyed with trouble; but making that which was after­ <lb/>
            wards to be the cause of his greatest pleasure wear at first <lb/>
            the appearance of calamity: either because such is the <lb/>
            perverse disposition of those beings, or becausehuman <lb/>
            nature cannot admit pure and unmixed joy. Cnemon, at <lb/>
            this very time, was flying from her whom he above all <lb/>
            things desired to meet, and frightened at that which would <lb/>
            have been to him the most pleasing of sights ;for the lady <lb/>
            who was thus lamenting was not Thisbe but Chariclea. <lb/>
            The train of accidents which brought her into the house of <lb/>
            Nausicles was as follows :-</p>
          <p>After Thyamis was taken prisoner, the island set on fire, <lb/>
            and its pirate inhabitants expelled, Thermuthis, his lieute­ <lb/>
            nant, and Cnemon crossed over the lake in the morning to <lb/>
            make inquiries after Thyamis. What happened on their <lb/>
            expedition, has been before related. Theagenes and Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea, were left alone in the cave, and esteemed what was <lb/>
            to prove only an excess of calamity, a great present blessing; <lb/>
            since now for the first time, being left alone, and freed <lb/>
            from every intruding eye, they indulged themselves in <lb/>
            unrestrained embraces and endearments ;and forgetting all <lb/>
            the world, and clinging together as though forming but <lb/>
            one body, they enjoyed the first fruits of pure and virgin <lb/>
            love; warm tears were mingled with their chaste kisses; <lb/>
            chaste I say, for if at any time human nature was about to <lb/>
            prevail on Theagenes he was checked by Chariclea, and put <lb/>
            in mind of his oath; nor was it difficult to bring him back <lb/>
            within due bounds, for though not proof against pure love, <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            he was superior to mere sensual desire. But when at <lb/>
            length they called to mind that this was a time for con­ <lb/>
            sultation they ceased their dalliance, and Theagenes began <lb/>
            as follows:—</p>
          <p>" That we may spend our lives together, my dearest Chari­ <lb/>
            clea, and obtain at last that union which we prefer to every <lb/>
            earthly blessing, and for the sake of which wo have under­ <lb/>
            gone so much, is my fervent prayer, and may the gods of <lb/>
            Greece grant it! But since every thing human is flue. <lb/>
            tuating, and subject to change, since we havo suffered <lb/>
            much, and have yet much to hope, as wo have appointed to <lb/>
            meet Cnemon at Chemmis, and are uncertain what fortunes <lb/>
            may await us there, and, in fine, as the country to which all <lb/>
            our wishes tend is at a great distance, let us agree upon <lb/>
            some token by which we may secretly hold communication <lb/>
            when present; and, if at any time separated, may trace out <lb/>
            each other in absence; for a token between friends is an <lb/>
            excellent companion in a wanderer's journey, and may often <lb/>
            be the means of again bringing them together."</p>
          <p>Chariclea was pleased with the proposal; and they agreed, <lb/>
            if they were divided, to write upon any temple, noted <lb/>
            statue, bust of Mercury,* or boundary-stone, Theagenes the <lb/>
            word Pythicus, and Chariclea Pythias; whether they were <lb/>
            gone to the right or the left; to what city, town, or people; <lb/>
            and the day and hour of their writing. If they met in any <lb/>
            circumstances, or under any disguise, they depended upon <lb/>
            their mutual affection to discover one another, which they <lb/>
            were certain no time could efface, or even lessen. Chariclea, <lb/>
            however, showed him the ring which had been exposed with <lb/>
            her, and Theagenes exhibited a scar made upon his knee by <lb/>
            a wild boar. They agreed on a watch-word: she, lampas <lb/>
            (a lamp), he, phoinix (a palm-tree). Having made these <lb/>
            arrangements, they again embraced each other, and again <lb/>
            wept, pouring out their tears as libations, and using kisses <lb/>
            as oaths.</p>
          <p>At last they went out of the cave, touching none of the <lb/>
            treasures it contained, thinking riches obtained by plunder <lb/>
            an abomination. They selected, however, some of the <lb/>
            richest jewels which they themselves bad brought from <lb/>
            Delphi, and which the pirates had taken from them, and <note type="footnote"> * ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερμαι̃</foreign>—four-cornered stone pillars ending with a bust of Mercury, <lb/>
            and set up in public places. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            prepared for their journey. Chariclea changed her dress, <lb/>
            packing up in a bundle her necklace, her crown, and sacred <lb/>
            garments; and, the better to conceal them, put over them <lb/>
            things of less value. She gave the bow and quiver (the <lb/>
            emblems of the god under whom he served) to Theagenes <lb/>
            to bear: to him a pleasant burden.</p>
          <p>They now approached the lake, and were preparing to get <lb/>
            into a boat, when they saw a company of armed men passing <lb/>
            over toward the island. Rendered dizzy by the sight, they <lb/>
            stood for some time astounded, as if deprived of all feeling <lb/>
            by the continued assaults of unwearied evil fortune. At <lb/>
            last, however, and just as the men were landing, Chariclea <lb/>
            proposed to retire again into the cave, and endeavour to <lb/>
            conceal themselves there; and was running towards it, when <lb/>
            Theagenes stopped her, and exclaimed, “Why should we <lb/>
            vainly endeavour to fly from that fate which pursues us <lb/>
            every where? Let us yield to our fortune, and meet it <lb/>
            with fortitude: what besides should we gain but unending <lb/>
            troubles, a wandering life, and still renewed assaults of the <lb/>
            evil genius who mocks and persecutes us ? Have you not <lb/>
            experienced how he has added, with savage eagerness, the <lb/>
            assaults of pirates to exile, and worse perils by land to those <lb/>
            we suffered by sea; how he terrified us first with fightings, <lb/>
            afterwards threw us into the hands of buccaneers, detained <lb/>
            us some time in captivity, then left us solitary and deserted, <lb/>
            just gave us a prospect of flight and freedom, and now <lb/>
            sends ruffians to destroy us; plays off his warfare against <lb/>
            us and our fortunes, and gives them the appearance of a <lb/>
            continually shifting scene, and sadly varied drama? Let <lb/>
            us put an end then to the tragedy, and give ourselves up to <lb/>
            those who are prepared for our destruction, lest the con­ <lb/>
            tinued pressure and increase of our misfortunes oblige us, <lb/>
            at last, to lay violent hands upon ourselves.”</p>
          <p>Chariélea did not entirely agree with all which her lover <lb/>
            in his passion said. She admitted the justice of his expos­ <lb/>
            tulations with fortune, but could not see the propriety of <lb/>
            giving themselves up into the hands of the armed men. It <lb/>
            was not certain that they meant to destroy them; the evil <lb/>
            genius who pursued them would not, perhaps, be kind enough <lb/>
            to put so quick an end to their miseries ; he probably reserved <lb/>
            them to experience the hardships of servitude; and was it <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            not worse than death to be exposed to the insults and <lb/>
            indignities of the barbarians P “Let us endeavour, there­ <lb/>
            fore, Of said she, “by all means in our power to avoid this fate. <lb/>
            We may, from past experience, have some hopes of success: <lb/>
            we have frequently, already, escaped from dangers which <lb/>
            appeared inevitable."</p>
          <p>“Let us do as you please," said Theagenes; and followed <lb/>
            her, unwillingly, as she led the way. They could not, how­ <lb/>
            ever, escape in safety to the cave; for while they were <lb/>
            looking only at the enemy in front, they were not aware of <lb/>
            another troop which had landed on a different part of the <lb/>
            island, and which was taking them from behind, as in a <lb/>
            net.* They were now utterly confounded, and stood still, <lb/>
            Chariclea keeping close by Theagenes, so that if they were <lb/>
            to die they might die together. Some of the men who <lb/>
            approached were just preparing to strike; but when the <lb/>
            youthful pair, looking up, flashed upon them the full splen­ <lb/>
            dour of their beauty, their hearts failed them, and their hands <lb/>
            grew slack; for the arm even of a barbarian reverences the <lb/>
            beautiful, and the fiercest eye grows milder before a lovely <lb/>
            countenance. They took them prisoners, therefore, and <lb/>
            conducted them to their leader, anxious to lay before him <lb/>
            the first and fairest of the spoils. It was the only booty, <lb/>
            however, which they were likely to obtain, for they could <lb/>
            find nothing else, after the strictest search throughout the <lb/>
            island. Everything on the surface of it had been destroyed <lb/>
            by the late conflagration. They were ignorant of the cave <lb/>
            and its contents. They proceeded then towards their com­ <lb/>
            mander: he was Mithranes, commandant to Oroondates, <lb/>
            viceroy of Egypt, under the Great King, whom Nausicles <lb/>
            (as has been said) had induced, by a great sum of money, <lb/>
            to make this expedition into the island in search of Thisbe. <lb/>
            Upon the approach of Theagenes and Chariclea, Nausicles, <lb/>
            with the quick-sighted craft of a merchant, started forward, <lb/>
            and running up, exclaimed, “This is indeed Thisbe, the <lb/>
            very Thisbe ravished from me by those villain pirates, <lb/>
            but restored by your kindness, Mithranes, and by the <lb/>
            gods." He then caught hold of Chariclea, and seemed in <note type="footnote"> * <unclear>ε̃λαθoν</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαγηνευθέντες</foreign>. For an account of the Persian mode of <lb/>

            an ecstacy of joy; at the same time he spoke to her pri­ <lb/>
            vately in Greek, in a low voice, and bid her, if she valued <lb/>
            her life, pretend that her name was Thisbe.</p>
          <p>This scheme succeeded. Chariclea, pleased at hearing <lb/>
            her native language, and flattering herself with the hopes <lb/>
            of comfort and assistance from the man who spoke it, did <lb/>
            as he bid her; and when Mithranes asked her her name, <lb/>
            said it was Thisbe. Nausicles then ran up to Mithranes, <lb/>
            kissed his head, flattered the barbarian's vanity, extolled <lb/>
            his good fortune, and congratulated him that,besides his many <lb/>
            other exploits, this expedition had bad such good success. <lb/>
            He, cajoled by these praises, and really believing the truth <lb/>
            of what was said (being deceived by the natne), <unclear>though</unclear> <lb/>
            smitten with the beauty of the maiden, which shone out <lb/>
            under a sorry garb, like the moon- from beneath a cloud; <lb/>
            yet, confounded by the quickness of Nausicles's manœuvres, <lb/>
            and having no time given to his fickle mind for change of pur­ <lb/>
            pose, said, " Take, then, this maiden, whom my arms have <lb/>
            recovered for you;" and so saying, he delivered her into his <lb/>
            hands, unwillingly and frequently looking back upon her, as <lb/>
            if he would not have parted with her had he not thought <lb/>
            himself pledged, by the reward he had received, to give her <lb/>
            up. "But as for her companion," he added, pointing to <lb/>
            Theagenes, “he shall be my prize. Let him follow me <lb/>
            under a guard; he shall be sent to Babylon: with such a <lb/>
            figure as his, he will become the service of the great king." <lb/>
            And having thus signified his pleasure, they passed over <lb/>
            the lake, and were separated from each other. Nausicles <lb/>
            took the road to Chemmis, with Chariclea; Mithranes visited <lb/>
            some other towns which were under his command, and very <lb/>
            soon sent Theagenes to Oroondates, who was then at Mem­ <lb/>
            phis, accompanied with the following letter:­</p>
          <p>“Mithranes, Commandant, to the Viceroy Oroondates.</p>
          <p>" I have taken prisoner a Grecian youth of too noble an <lb/>
            appearance to continue in my service, and worthy to appear <lb/>
            before, and serve only, the Great King. I send him to von, <lb/>
            that you may offer him to our common master, as a great <lb/>
            and inestimable present, such a one as the royal court has <lb/>
            never yet beheld, and probably never will again." <note type="footnote">* “. . . . Simul ac vaga lulla decorum <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Scarcely had the day dawned when eager curiosity carried <lb/>
            Calasiris and Cnemon to the apartment of Nausicles, to <lb/>
            inquire farther into his adventures. He told them all that <lb/>
            I have related: how he arrived at the island; how he found <lb/>
            it deserted; the deceit he had put upon Mithranes, in <lb/>
            passing off another maiden upon him for Thisbe; he was <lb/>
            better pleased, he said, with his present prize than if he had <lb/>
            really found Thisbe; there was no more comparison between <lb/>
            their several beauties than between a mortal and a goddess; <lb/>
            hers was unrivalled, it was impossible for hint to express <lb/>
            how beautiful she was; but, as she was under his roof, they <lb/>
            might satisfy themselves with their own eyes. When they <lb/>
            heard this, they began to suspect a little of the truth, and <lb/>
            besought him to send for her immediately, as knowing that <lb/>
            words could not do justice to her personal appearance.</p>
          <p>When she was introduced (with downcast eyes, and her <lb/>
            face veiled to her forehead), and Nausicles had besought her <lb/>
            to be of good cheer, she looked up a little, and saw (beyond <lb/>
            her hopes), and was seen by, her unexpected friends. <lb/>
            Immediately a sudden cry was heard from all. These <lb/>
            exclamations burst out at once, “My father!”—“ My <lb/>
            daughter! Chariclea herself! and not Cnemon’s Thisbe. <lb/>
            Nausicles stood mute with astonishment when he saw CaIn­ <lb/>
            siris embracing Chariclea, and weeping for joy. He won­ <lb/>
            dered what this could be which had the air of a recognition <lb/>
            on the stage, when Calasiris ran to him, and embracing <lb/>
            him, cried out, " 0 best of men, may the gods shower on <lb/>
            you every blessing you desire, as you have been the pre­ <lb/>
            server of my daughter, and have restored to my longing <lb/>
            eyes the delight of my life. But, my child, my Chariclea! <lb/>
            where have you left Theagenes?” She wept at the ques­ <lb/>
            tion, and, pausing a little, said, " He who delivered me to <lb/>
            this gentleman, whoever he may be, has led him away cap­ <lb/>
            tive." Calasiris besought Nausicles to discover to turn all <lb/>
            ho knew about Theagenes; under whose power he now was; <lb/>
            and whither they had taken him.</p>
          <p>The merchant gave him all the information he was able, <lb/>
            conceiving this to be the pair about whom he had frequently <lb/>
            heard the old man speak, and whom he knew he was seeking <lb/>
            in sorrow. He added, that he feared his intelligence would <lb/>
            not be of much service to persons in their humble circum­ <lb/>
            stances; he doubted, indeed, whether any sum of money <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            would induce Mithranes to part with the youth. a We are <lb/>
            rich enough," said Chariclea softly to Calasiris; " promise <lb/>
            him as much as you please; I have preserved the necklace <lb/>
            which you know of, and have it with me." Calasiris reco­ <lb/>
            vered his spirits at hearing this; but not choosing to let <lb/>
            Nausicles into the secret of their wealth, replied, " My good <lb/>
            Nausicles, the wise man is never poor; he measures his de­ <lb/>
            sires by his possessions, and receives from those who abound <lb/>
            what it is honourable for him to ask. Tell us then where <lb/>
            the person is who has Theagenes in his power; the divine <lb/>
            goodness will not be wanting to us, but will supply us with <lb/>
            as much as is sufficient to satisfy the avarice of this Persian."</p>
          <p>Nausicles smiled incredulously. " I shall," said he, <lb/>
            “be persuaded that you can suddenly grow rich, as by a <lb/>
            miracle, when you have first paid down to me a ransom for <lb/>
            this maiden; you know that riches have as many charms for <lb/>
            a merchant as for a Persian.”—“ I know it," replied the <lb/>
            old man, "and you shall have a ransom. But why do you <lb/>
            not anticipate my wishes, and, with your customary bene­ <lb/>
            volence, offer, of your own accord, to restore my daughter ? <lb/>
            Must I be forced to entreat it of you ?”—“ You shall have <lb/>
            her on proper terms," said the merchant. " I do not grudge <lb/>
            you her; but now (as I am going to sacrifice) let us join in <lb/>
            supplication to the gods, and pray that they would increase <lb/>
            my wealth, and bestow some on you.”—“ Spare your ridi­ <lb/>
            cule," replied Calasiris, " and be not incredulous; make <lb/>
            preparations for the sacrifice, and we will attend you when <lb/>
            everything is ready."</p>
          <p>Nausicles agreed to this, and soon after sent a message <lb/>
            to his guests to desire their presence. They obeyed cheer­ <lb/>
            fully, having before concerted what they were to do. The <lb/>
            men accompanied Nausicles to the altar, with many others <lb/>
            who were invited, for it was a public sacrifice. Chariclea <lb/>
            went with the merchant's daughter and some other females, <lb/>
            whose encouragements and entreaties had prevailed upon <lb/>
            her to be present at the ceremony; and they would hardly <lb/>
            have persuaded her had she not secretly pleased herself <lb/>
            with the thought of taking this opportunity to pour out her <lb/>
            vows and prayers for Theagenes.</p>
          <p>They came to the temple of Mercury (for him, as the god <lb/>
            of gain and merchants, Nausicles particularly worshipped) ; <lb/>
            and when the sacred rites were performed, Calasiris inspect­ <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            ing the entrails of the victim, and changing his countenance <lb/>
            according as they portended joyful or adverse events, at last <lb/>
            stretched out his hand, (murmuring certain words) and pre. <lb/>
            tending to take something from among the ashes, presented <lb/>
            a ring of great value to Nausicles, which he had brought <lb/>
            with him for that purpose : “And here,” said he, " the gods, <lb/>
            by my hands, offer you this as a ransom for Chariclea.”</p>
          <p>The ring - was a perfect marvel, both for material and <lb/>
            workmanship. The circle was of electrum, within the bezil † <lb/>
            was an Æthiopian amethyst, of the size of a maiden's eye, <lb/>
            finer much than those of Spain or Britain ; for these latter <lb/>
            have a dullish tinge of purple, like a rose just bursting from <lb/>
            its bud, and beginning to redden under the sun's beams; <lb/>
            whereas the Æthiopian amethyst shines with a deeper and <lb/>
            more sparkling lustre; if you turn it about it scatters <lb/>
            its rays on all sides, not dulling but lighting up the sight.</p>
          <p>“They are besides of much greater virtue than the <lb/>
            western ones ; they do not belie their name, ‡ but will really <lb/>
            keep those who wear them sober amid great excesses. This <lb/>
            property is common to all the Indian and Æthiopian stones: <lb/>
            but that which Calasiris now gave Nausicles far surpassed <lb/>
            them. It was carved with wonderful art, and represented a <lb/>
            shepherd tending his sheep. He sat upon a rock, gently <lb/>
            elevated from the ground, surveying his flock, and distribut­ <lb/>
            ing them § into different pastures by the various notes of his <lb/>
            pipe; they seemed to obey, and to feed as the sound <lb/>
            directed them. You would say that they had golden fleeces, <lb/>
            the natural blush of the amethyst, without the aid of art, <lb/>
            casting a glow upon their backs. Here you might observe <lb/>
            the frolics of the little lambs; some climbing up the ascent, <lb/>
            others gambolling around the shepherd, converted the rock <lb/>
            into a pastoral theatre. Some wantoning in the flame <note type="footnote"> * " A precious ring that lightens all the hole; <lb/>

            of the gem as in the sun, just touched in bounding the <lb/>
            rocky surface; others, older and more bold, seemed as if <lb/>
            they would overleap the circle; but here art had hindered <lb/>
            them, and surrounded the jewel in the rock with the golden <lb/>
            bezil. The rock was not counterfeit, but real; the artist, <lb/>
            to represent it, had inclosed the edges of the stone, and was <lb/>
            not put to the trouble of feigning what in reality existed. <lb/>
            Such then was the ring.</p>
          <p>Nausicles was struck at the seeming miracle, and de­ <lb/>
            lighted with the beauty of the gem, which he esteemed to <lb/>
            be of more value than all he was worth.—“ I was but <lb/>
            jesting," said he, "my dear Calasiris, when I talked of a <lb/>
            ransom for your daughter; my design was to restore her to <lb/>
            you freely; and without price; but since, as they say, the <lb/>
            gifts of the gods are not to be refused, I accept this jewel <lb/>
            which is sent from heaven; persuaded that it is a present <lb/>
            from Mercury, the best of deities, who has furnished you <lb/>
            with it through the fire, and indeed you see how it sparkles <lb/>
            itself with flames : besides, I think that the pleasantest and <lb/>
            most lawful gain is that which, without impoverishing the <lb/>
            giver, enriches the receiver."</p>
          <p>Having said this, he took the ring, and proceeded with <lb/>
            the rest of the company to an entertainment; the women <lb/>
            by themselves, in the interior of the temple; the men in the <lb/>
            vestibule. When they had satisfied their appetite, and the <lb/>
            board was crowned with cups, they sang a suitable * <lb/>
            hymn to Bacchus, and poured out libations to him; the <lb/>
            women sang an hymn of thanksgiving to Ceres. Chariclea, <lb/>
            retiring from the rest, occupied with her own thoughts, <lb/>
            prayed for the health and safe return of Tbeagenes.</p>
          <p>And now, the company being warmed with wine, and rife <lb/>
            with mirth, Nausicles, holding out a goblet of pure water, <lb/>
            said, " Good Calasiris, let us offer this to the nymphs, the <lb/>
            sober nymphs your deities, who have no sympathy with <lb/>
            Bacchus, and are nymphs in very deed; but if you will <lb/>
            entertain us with such a relation as we wish to hear, it will <lb/>
            be more pleasant to us than even our flowing bowls. You see <lb/>
            the women have already risen from the table, and are amusing <lb/>
            themselves with dancing; but neither dancing nor music will <lb/>
            be so pleasant to us as the narrative of your wanderings, if you <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμβατήρια</foreign>.—Literally, airs suitable for a march or an embarkation. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>

            will favour us with it. You have often excused yourself <lb/>
            from the task on account of the troubles with which you <lb/>
            were overwhelmed, and the lowness of your spirits; but <lb/>
            there cannot be a more proper time for it than the present, <lb/>
            when everything contributes to remove the one and to raise <lb/>
            the other. You have recovered your daughter, and bavo <lb/>
            hopes of recovering your son; especially if you do not <lb/>
            affront me, by deferring your story any longer.</p>
          <p>"Now may all good attend you, Nausicles," said Cnemon, <lb/>
            putting in his word; who, although you have provided all <lb/>
            manner of music for our recreation, are willing to forego <lb/>
            such delights (leaving them to ordinary minds), and to listen <lb/>
            to higher and mysterious matters, seasoned with a divine <lb/>
            interest. You snowjudgment in coupling together the <lb/>
            deities, Mercury and Bacchus, thus mingling the pleasures <lb/>
            of discourse with those of wine. Though I admire the <lb/>
            whole order of this splendid sacrifice, yet I know nothing <lb/>
            which will render the god of eloquence more propitious, <lb/>
            than if this good old man will contribute his narrative * to <lb/>
            the rest of the entertainment."</p>
          <p>Calasiris obeyed, as well to oblige Cnemon, as to con­ <lb/>
            ciliate the favour of Nausicles, whose f services he fore­ <lb/>
            saw he should have occasion for, and entered upon his <lb/>
            story. He began with what he had already related to <lb/>
            Cnemon; he was now, however, less minute, and entirely <lb/>
            passed over some matters which he did not choose Nausicles <lb/>
            to know; and when he had proceeded to the point where he <lb/>
            had before left off,‡ be went on as follows :</p>
          <p>" As the wind was at first very favourable to us, the fugi­ <lb/>
            tives from Delphi began to flatter themselves with the hopes <lb/>
            of a prosperous voyage; but when we got into the straits <lb/>
            of Calydon,§ the swell and rolling of the waves alarmed them <lb/>
            not a little;" here Cnemon, interrupting, begged him to <lb/>
            explain, if he could, the cause of that agitation. “ The <lb/>
            Ionian sea," continued Calasiris, “from being wide beyond, <lb/>
            is there contracted, and pours itself, by a narrow channel, <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγους είς εὺωχίαν ἐρανιζομενός. ἒρανος</foreign>—a meal to which each <lb/>

             <pb n="115"/>
            into the Crissæan gulf; whence, hastening to mingle its <lb/>
            waters with the Ægean, it is stopped and thrown back again <lb/>
            by the Isthmus of Peloponnesus; which is opposed, probably, <lb/>
            as a rampart by divine providence, lest it should overflow <lb/>
            the opposite land: and a greater reflux being occasioned in <lb/>
            the strait than in the rest of the gulf, from the encounter <lb/>
            of the advancing and retreating tides the waves, owing to <lb/>
            . this repercussion, boil, swell, and break in tumult one over <lb/>
            the other." This explanation was received with the applause <lb/>
            and approbation of all; and the old man continued his <lb/>
            narration.</p>
          <p>“ Having passed the strait, and lost sight of the Oxinn * <lb/>
            Isles, we thought we discovered the promontory of Za­ <lb/>
            cynthus, which rose on our sight like an obscure cloud, and <lb/>
            the pilot gave orders to furl the sails. We inquired why he <lb/>
            slackened the vessel's speed, when we had a prosperous <lb/>
            wind : ' Because,' said he, if we continue to sail at the rate <lb/>
            we do at present, we shall arrive off the island about the <lb/>
            first watch of the night; and I fear lest, in the darkness, we <lb/>
            may strike upon some of the rocks which abound under the <lb/>
            sea on that coast: it is better therefore for us to keep out <lb/>
            at sea all night, carrying only so much sail as may suffice <lb/>
            to bring us under the island in the morning.' This was the <lb/>
            opinion of the pilot: however we made land sooner than he <lb/>
            expected, and cast anchor at Zacynthus just as the sun rose.</p>
          <p>“ The inhabitants of the port, which was not far distant <lb/>
            from the city, flocked together at our arrival, as to an <lb/>
            unusual spectacle. They admired the construction of our <lb/>
            vessel, framed with regard both to size and beauty; and <lb/>
            from thence formed an idea of the skill and industry of <lb/>
            the Phoenicians. Still more did they wonder at our un­ <lb/>
            common good fortune in having had so prosperous a pas­ <lb/>
            sage, in the midst of winter, and at the setting of the <lb/>
            Pleiades.</p>
          <p>" Almost all the ship's company, while the vessel was <lb/>
            being moored, hurried off to the city to buy what things <lb/>
            they wanted. I strolled about in search of a lodging, some­ <lb/>
            where on the shore, for the pilot had told me that we should <lb/>
            probably winter at Zacynthus: to remain on board the ship <lb/>
            would have been very inconvenient, because of the noisy <note type="footnote"> * These islands, mentioned before, lie south-west of Acarnania. </note> <note type="footnote"> I 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            crew, and our fugitives could not be so well concealed in <lb/>
            the city as their situation required.</p>
          <p>" When I had walked a little way, I saw an old fisherman <lb/>
            sitting before his door, and mending his nets. I approached <lb/>
            and addressed him-‘ Can you inform me, my good friend,' <lb/>
            said I, ‘ where I can hire a lodging ‘It was broken,' <lb/>
            said he, ‘ near yonder promontory, having caught upon a <lb/>
            rock.'-‘ This was not what I inquired,' said I; ' but you <lb/>
            would do me a kind office if you will either receive me into <lb/>
            your own house, or show me another where I may be taken <lb/>
            in.'—‘ It was not I who did it, I warrant you,' said he; ‘ I <lb/>
            was not in the boat; old ago has not yet so dulled the <lb/>
            faculties of Tyrrhenus. It was the fault of the lubberly <lb/>
            boys which occasioned this mishap, who, from ignorance of <lb/>
            the reefs, spread their nets in the wrong place.'</p>
          <p>“ Perceiving now that he was hard of hearing, I bawled <lb/>
            out at the top of my voice, ‘ Good day to you! Can you show <lb/>
            us, who are strangers, a place where we may find lodging ?' <lb/>
            -‘ The same to you,' answered he. ‘ You may, if you <lb/>
            please, lodge with me; unless, perhaps, you are one of those <lb/>
            who require a great many beds and chambers, and have a <lb/>
            large number of servants with you.' Upon my saying: <lb/>
            I have only two children with nlyself -‘ A very good <lb/>
            number,' he replied,‘ for you will find my family consist of <lb/>
            only one more. I have two sons who live witH me; their <lb/>
            elder brothers are married and settled by themselves; I <lb/>
            have, besides, the nurse of my children, for their mother <lb/>
            has been some time dead; wherefore, good sir, do not hesi­ <lb/>
            tate, nor doubt that we shall receive gladly one whose first <lb/>
            aspect is venerable and .prepossessing.' I accepted his <lb/>
            offer: and when I returned afterwards with Theagenes and <lb/>
            Chariclea, the old fisherman received us with great cor­ <lb/>
            diality, and assigned us the warmest and most convenient <lb/>
            part of his habitation.</p>
          <p>“The beginning of the winter passed hero not unplea­ <lb/>
            santly. We lived together in the day time : at night we <lb/>
            separated. Chariclea slept in one apartment, with the <lb/>
            nurse, I in another, with Theagenes, and Tyrrhenus in a <lb/>
            third, with his children. Our table was in* common, and <lb/>
            well supplied; the old man furnished it abundantly with <lb/>
            provision from the sea. We frequently amused our leisure <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            by assisting him in fishing, in which art he was very skilful, <lb/>
            and had tackle for it in abundance, and suited for every <lb/>
            season.* The coast was convenient for placing his nets, and <lb/>
            abounded with fish, so that most people attributed his <lb/>
            success in his occupation to his good fortune alone, which <lb/>
            was in part, however, owing to his skill. Thus, for some <lb/>
            time, we lived in peace; but it is not permitted to the <lb/>
            unhappy to be long at ease; nor could the charms of Chari­ <lb/>
            clea, even in this solitude, be exempt from disturbance.</p>
          <p>" The Tyrian merchant, that victor in the Pythian games, <lb/>
            with whom we sailed, was very annoying to me; he took <lb/>
            every opportunity of pressing me with earnestness, as a <lb/>
            father, to grant him Chariclea in marriage. He vaunted <lb/>
            his family and his fortune. He said that the vessel in <lb/>
            which we sailed was entirely his property; and the greatest <lb/>
            part of her cargo, which consisted of gold, precious stones, <lb/>
            and silk. He crowned all these, and many other recom­ <lb/>
            mendations of himself, with his victory in Greece, which he <lb/>
            thought reflected no small lustre upon him. I objected my <lb/>
            present poverty, and that I could never bring myself to <lb/>
            dispose of my daughter in a foreign country, and at such <lb/>
            a distance from Egypt. ‘ Talk not of poverty,' he would <lb/>
            reply; ‘ I shall esteem the gift of Chariclea's hand more <lb/>
            than a portion of a thousand talents. Wherever she is, I <lb/>
            shall look upon that place as my country; I am ready to <lb/>
            change my destined course to Carthage, and sail with you <lb/>
            wherever you please.'</p>
          <p>" When, alter some time, I saw the Phœnician relax <lb/>
            nothing of his importunity, but that he grew more urgent <lb/>
            every day in his solicitations, I determined to flatter him <lb/>
            with fallacious hopes, lest he should offer some violence to <lb/>
            us in the island, and promised I would do everything which <lb/>
            he wished when wo arrived in Egypt. But I had no sooner <lb/>
            thus quieted him a little, than a new wave of trouble came <lb/>
            rolling in upon me.† <note type="footnote"> * In Idyll. xxi. of Theocritus, the fisherman's tackle is described— <lb/>

          <p>“ Old Tyrrhenus accosted me one day as I was wandering <lb/>
            in a retired part of the coast. ‘ My good Calasiris,' said <lb/>
            he, ‘ Neptune is my witness, and all the gods, that I regard <lb/>
            you as my brother, and your children as my own. I am <lb/>
            come to discover to you a gathering danger winch will occa­ <lb/>
            sion you great uneasiness, but which I cannot, with any <lb/>
            regard to the laws of hospitality, conceal from one who <lb/>
            lodges under my roof, and which it concerns you much to <lb/>
            be acquainted with. A nest of pirates, concealed under the <lb/>
            side of yonder promontory, are lying in wait for your Phœ­ <lb/>
            nician vessel. They are continually on the watch for your <lb/>
            sailing out of port. I caution you, therefore, to beware, <lb/>
            and to consider what you have to do; for it is on your <lb/>
            account, or rather, as I suspect, on account of your daugh­ <lb/>
            ter, that they have conceived this audacious design, which <lb/>
            they are but too well prepared for.'</p>
          <p>.'May the gods reward you,' said I, ‘ for your kind <lb/>
            information; but, my dear Tyrrhenus, how did you obtain <lb/>
            your intelligence ?'—' My trade,' ho auswered, makes me <lb/>
            acquainted with these men; I take fish to them, for which <lb/>
            they pay me a better price than others; and yesterday, as <lb/>
            I was taking up lilY nets on the shore, Trachinus, the <lb/>
            captain of the pirates, came and asked me if 1 knew when <lb/>
            the Phœnicians intended to set sail. I, suspecting his <lb/>
            intent, replied, that indeed I did not exactly know, but I <lb/>
            supposed that it would be early in the spring. ' Does the <lb/>
            fair maiden, who lodges at your house, sail with them ?'— <lb/>
            ‘I really don't know,' said I. ‘ But why are you so <lb/>
            curious?'-‘ Because I love her to distraction,' he returned. <lb/>
            ‘I did so at first sight. I never saw a form comparable to <lb/>
            hers; and yet my eyes have been used to beauty, and I have <lb/>
            had in my power some of the most charming captives of all <lb/>
            nations.'</p>
          <p>I wished to draw him on a little, that I might get <lb/>
            acquainted with his design. 'Why,' said I, 'should you <lb/>
            attack the Phœnicians; cannot you take her away from my <lb/>
            house without bloodshed, and before they embark ?'-‘ The <lb/>
            regard I have for you,' he returned, ' prevents me from <lb/>
            doing this. There is a sense of honour even among pirates <lb/>
            towards friends and acquaintances. If I were to carry off <lb/>
            the strangers from your house, it might bring you into <lb/>
            some troubles ;they would probably be required at your <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            hands. Besides, by waiting for them at sea, I obtain two <lb/>
            ends: I may make myself master of a rich vessel, as well as <lb/>
            of the maid I love. One of these I must necessarily give <lb/>
            up, if I make the attempt by land; neither would it be <lb/>
            without danger so near the city: the inhabitants would <lb/>
            soon become acquainted with my enterprize, and pursuit <lb/>
            would be immediate.' I praised his prudence, and left him. <lb/>
            I now discover to you the design of these villains, and <lb/>
            beseech you to adopt means for the preservation of yourself <lb/>
            and your children.'</p>
          <p>" Having heard this, I went away in great trouble, and <lb/>
            revolving various thoughts in my mind, when I met, by <lb/>
            accident, with my Tyrian merchant. He talked to me on <lb/>
            the old subject, and gave me occasion to try him on a <lb/>
            scheme which just then struck me. I related to him just <lb/>
            as much of the fisherman's discovery as I thought proper. <lb/>
            I told him that one of the inhabitants of Zacynthus, who <lb/>
            was too powerful for hint to resist, had a design to carry off <lb/>
            Chariclea. ' For my part,' I added, 'I had much rather <lb/>
            give her to you, as well on account of our acquaintance as <lb/>
            of your opulent condition; and, above all, because you have <lb/>
            promised to settle in our country after your marriage; if, <lb/>
            therefore, you have this alliance much at heart, we must <lb/>
            sail from hence in all haste, before we are prevented, and <lb/>
            violence is offered.' He was much pleased at hearing me <lb/>
            talk in this manner. ‘ You arc much in the right, my <lb/>
            father,' he said; and, approaching, kissed my head, and <lb/>
            asked me when I would have him to set sail, for though the <lb/>
            sea was at this season hardly navigable, yet we might <lb/>
            make some other port, and so, escaping from the snares <lb/>
            laid for us here, might wait with patience the approach <lb/>
            of spring.'-‘ If,' I replied, ‘ my wishes have weight with <lb/>
            you, I would sail this very night.'—‘ Be it so,' said he, and <lb/>
            went away.</p>
          <p>it I returned home. I said nothing to Tyrrhenus; but I <lb/>
            told my children that, at the close of the day, they must <lb/>
            embark again on board the vessel. They wondered at this <lb/>
            sudden order, and asked the reason of it. I excused myself <lb/>
            from explaining it then; but said, it was absolutely neces­ <lb/>
            sary that it should be obeyed.</p>
          <p>" After a moderate supper I retired to rest; but I bad no <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            sooner fallen asleep, than an old man* seemed to appear to <lb/>
            me, in a dream : withered and lean, in other respects, but <lb/>
            showing, from the muscular appearance of his knees, the <lb/>
            marks of former strength. He bad a helmet on his head ; <lb/>
            bis countenance was intelligent and shrewd, and he seemed <lb/>
            to drug one thigh after him, as if it had been wounded, He <lb/>
            approached me, and said with a sarcastic smile,—6 Do you <lb/>
            alone treat me with contempt P All those who have sailed <lb/>
            by Cephalene, have been desirous to visit my habitation, <lb/>
            and to contemplate my glory; you only seem to despise me, <lb/>
            and have not given me so much as a common salutation, <lb/>
            though you dwell in mv neighbourhood. But you shall <lb/>
            soon suffer for this negligence; and shall experience the <lb/>
            same calamities, and encounter the same enemies, both by <lb/>
            sea and land, which I have done. But address the maiden <lb/>
            you have with you in the name of my consort; she salutes <lb/>
            her, as sho is a great patroness of chastity, and foretels her, <lb/>
            at last, a fortunate issue to all her troubles.'</p>
          <p>" I started up, trembling, at the vision. Then genes asked <lb/>
            what ailed me. ‘We shall be too late, said I, for the ship’s <lb/>
            sailing out of port; it is this thought which has disturbed <lb/>
            and awakened me; but do you get up and collect our bag­ <lb/>
            gage, and I will go and see for Chariclea. Site appeared at <lb/>
            my first summons: Tyrrhenus, too, got up, and inquired <lb/>
            what we were about. What we are doing, said I, is by <lb/>
            your advice ; we are endeavouring to escape from those who <lb/>
            are lying in wait for us; and may the gods preserve and <lb/>
            reward you for all your goodness to us: but do you add this <lb/>
            to all the favours you have already bestowed upon us; pass, <lb/>
            I pray Nou, into Ithaca, and sacrifice for its to Ulysses, and <lb/>
            beseech him to moderate the anger which he has conceived <lb/>
            against us, and signified to me this night in a dream. He <lb/>
            promised lie would do so, and accompanied us to the ship, <lb/>
            shedding tears abundantly, and wishing us a prosperous <lb/>
            voyage, and all sorts of happiness. In short, as soon as the <lb/>
            morning star appeared, we set sail, much against the will of <lb/>
            the crew, who were with difficulty persuaded by the Tyrian <lb/>
            merchant, when they were told, that it was in order to <lb/>
            escape from a pirate, who lay in wait for them. He knew <lb/>
            not that what he thought a fiction, was the sober truth. <note type="footnote"> * Ulysses. </note> <pb n="121"/>

          <p>“ We encountered adverse winds, a swelling sea, and <lb/>
            almost continual tempests; we lost one* of our rudders; had <lb/>
            our yard-arms much injured, and were in imminent danger <lb/>
            of perishing, when we reached a promontory of Crete : here <lb/>
            wo determined to stay a few days, to repair our vessel and <lb/>
            refresh ourselves. We did so, and fixed for putting again <lb/>
            to sea the first day of the new moon, after her conjunction <lb/>
            with the sun.</p>
          <p>" We set sail, with a gentle south-west wind, directing <lb/>
            our course towards Africa, which our pilot used all his en­ <lb/>
            deavours to reach as soon as he could ; for he said he had <lb/>
            for some time observed a vessel hovering at a distance, <lb/>
            which he took for a pirate. ‘ Ever since we left Crete,' says <lb/>
            he, ‘ she has followed us; she steers the same course, and <lb/>
            without doubt it is by design, not accident; for I have often <lb/>
            changed my track, on purpose to see if she would do the <lb/>
            same, and she has always invariably done so.' A great part <lb/>
            of the crew were alarmed at this intelligence, and began to <lb/>
            exhort each other to prepare for defence; others neglected <lb/>
            it, and said it was a very common thing for small ships to <lb/>
            follow in the wake of larger ones, for the sake of being <lb/>
            directed in their way.</p>
          <p>“ While they were thus disputing, evening† approached; <lb/>
            the wind slackened gradually, breathed gently on the sails . <lb/>
            and now made them flutter a little, but hardly swelled them <lb/>
            at all. At length it subsided into a dead calm, setting with <lb/>
            the sun, or retiring, as I may say, to give advantage to our <lb/>
            pursuers ; for while there was a fresh gale our ship, spread­ <lb/>
            ing more canvas, far out-sailed them; but when the wind <lb/>
            dropped, when the sea was smooth, and we were driven to <lb/>
            make uso of our oars, this light and small vessel soon came <lb/>
            up with our largo and heavy one. When they came near, <lb/>
            one of the crew, an inhabitant of Zacynthus, cried out: ‘ We <note type="footnote"> * A ship had one, but more commonly two rudders. (See Acts xxvii. 40.) <lb/>
            In the Caspian Sea, where the old practice not long ago remained in force, <lb/>
            a modern traveller was nearly shipwrecked, because the rudders were in <lb/>
            the hands of two pilots who spoke different languages. To obviate such <lb/>
            disasters among the ancionts, the same steersman held both tillers, if <lb/>
            the boat was small. In larger ships the extremities of the helms <lb/>
            were joined by a pole, which was moved by one man and kept the <lb/>
            rudders always parallel.—Smith's Greek and Rom. Antiq. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              are undone, this is a pirate crew: I am well acquainted with <lb/>
              the ship of Trachinus.’</p>
          <p>" We were thunderstruck at this intelligence, and, in <lb/>
            the midst of a sea calm, our vessel shook with a tempest of <lb/>
            confusion ; it was full of tumult, lamentation, and hurrying <lb/>
            up and down. Some ran into the hold; others encouraged <lb/>
            one another to resist and fight; a third party were for get­ <lb/>
            ting into the boat, and so attempting an escape. While <lb/>
            they were thus in confusion, and mutually hindering each <lb/>
            other, the approach of danger put an end to their disputes, <lb/>
            and every one seized upon the weapon which was nearest <lb/>
            to him.</p>
          <p>“ Chariclea and myself, embracing Theagenes, were hardly <lb/>
            able to restrain his ardent spirit which was boiling for <lb/>
            the fight; she assuring hint that death should not separate <lb/>
            them ; but that the same sword which wounded him, should <lb/>
            put an end to her life. I, as soon as I knew that it was <lb/>
            Trachinus who pursued us, began to consider how best to <lb/>
            promote our future safety. The pirates coming close up <lb/>
            with us, crossed our course, and being very desirous of taking <lb/>
            us, did not use their arms; but rowing round us, prevented <lb/>
            our farther progress, like besiegers wishing to make us sur­ <lb/>
            render upon terms. ‘Fools,’ they cried out, ‘ why are you <lb/>
            so mad as to make a show of defence against so superior a <lb/>
            force ? drawing upon yourselves certain destruction ! We <lb/>
            are as yet disposed to treat you kindly ; you may even now, <lb/>
            if you please, get into your boats, and save your lives.’</p>
          <p>“ So long as a bloodless war was waged, the Phœnicians <lb/>
            were bold enough and refused to quit the vessel. But <lb/>
            when one of the pirates, more daring than his fellows, leapt <lb/>
            into the ship, and began to cut at them right and left with <lb/>
            his sword, and they became sensible that the matter was <lb/>
            now serious, and that wounds and blood must settle it, they <lb/>
            repented of their boldness, fell at their enemies' feet, begged <lb/>
            for quarter, and promised to do whatever they were or­ <lb/>
            dered.</p>
          <p>“ The pirates, although they had already begun the fight, <lb/>
            and though the sight of blood commonly whets the angry <lb/>
            passions, yet, at the command of Trachinus, unexpectedly <lb/>
            spared the suppliants. A truce ensued, but a truce more <lb/>
            dreadful, perhaps, than battle: it had the name of peace, <lb/>
            but war would have been scarcely less grievous. The con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            ditions of it were, that every mail should quit the ship, with <lb/>
            a single garment, and death was denounced against any <lb/>
            one who should violate these terms. But life, it seems, is <lb/>
            preferred by mankind before all other things; and the <lb/>
            Tyrians (robbed as they were of their ship and wealth), as <lb/>
            if they had gained rather than lost, contended with each <lb/>
            other who should be the first to leap into the boat and so <lb/>
            preserve their lives.</p>
          <p>" When we came into his presence, according to com­ <lb/>
            mand, Trachinus, taking Charielea by the hand said; ‘ We <lb/>
            wage not war against you, my charmer; although the hos­ <lb/>
            tilities are undertaken on your account. I have all along <lb/>
            been following you, ever since you left Zacynthus, despising <lb/>
            for your sake the sea and danger; be of good cheer, then, I <lb/>
            will make you mistress, with myself, of all these riches.' <lb/>
            It is the part of prudence to seize upon the opportunity. <lb/>
            So she, remembering some of my instructions, smoothed <lb/>
            her brow, which this sudden storm had ruffled, and com­ <lb/>
            posed her countenance to winning smiles.—‘I give the gods <lb/>
            thanks,' says she, ‘ for inspiring you with merciful senti­ <lb/>
            ments towards us ; but if you would win, and keep my con­ <lb/>
            fidence, give me this first mark of your good-will—preserve <lb/>
            to tHe my brother and my father, and do not order them to <lb/>
            quit the ship, for I cannot live without them ;' and with <lb/>
            this she fell at his feet, and embraced his knees.*</p>
          <p>“ Trachinus, thrilling with pleasure at her touch, that he <lb/>
            might enjoy it the longer, purposely delayed granting her <lb/>
            request. At last, melted by her tears, and subdued by her <lb/>
            looks, he raised her up, and said—‘I grant your prayer, as <lb/>
            to your brother with pleasure, he seems a youth of spirit <lb/>
            and may help us in our trade; but as for the old man, who <lb/>
            is but useless lumber, if I preserve him, it is only out of <lb/>
            great regard to your entreaties.'</p>
          <p>“While this was passing the sun set, and the dusk of <lb/>
            twilight surrounded us ; the sea began to swell on a sudden, <lb/>
            whether on account of the change of season, or the will of <lb/>
            fortune, I know not; the sound of rising wind was heard. <lb/>
            In a moment it swept down upon the sea, in stormy gusts, <lb/>
            and filled the hearts of the pirates with tumult and appre­ <lb/>
            hension; for they were overtaken with it after they had <note type="footnote"> * Raphael has chosen this incident for the subject of a painting. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            left their own bark, and bad got on board our ship for <lb/>
            the sake of plunder; this, from its size, they were un­ <lb/>
            used to, and unable to manage: their. seamanship was all <lb/>
            extemporised and self-taught, each for himself, boldly exer­ <lb/>
            cised some department of his art. Some furled the sails, <lb/>
            others clumsily pulled the ropes; one bungler ran to the <lb/>
            prow,† another attempted to manage the tiller at the stern; <lb/>
            no that we were in imminent danger, not so much from the <lb/>
            fury of the storm, which was not yet very violent, as from <lb/>
            the ignorance and unskilfulness of the sailors and pilot, who <lb/>
            as long as there was any glimmering of light, made a show <lb/>
            of resisting the tempest; but, when darkness overshadowed <lb/>
            us, totally gave the matter up. The waves now burst over us, <lb/>
            nud we were in peril of going to the bottom, when some of <lb/>
            the pirates made an attempt to get again on board of their <lb/>
            own bark, but were hindered and stopped by the rage of the <lb/>
            increasing tempest, and by the exhortations of Trachinus ; <lb/>
            who told them, that if they would preserve the ship on <lb/>
            board of which they were, together with its wealth, they <lb/>
            might buy a thousand such boats as their own. At length <lb/>
            he cut the cable by which it was kept in tow, maintaining <lb/>
            that it might be the cause of a fresh storm to them, and <lb/>
            that by so doing he provided for their future security; for <lb/>
            if they should touch at any port, bringing an empty bark <lb/>
            with them, an inquiry would naturally be made as to its <lb/>
            crew. His comrades approved of what he had done, and <lb/>
            found him to have shown his sense in two respects ; for they <lb/>
            felt the ship a good deal eased after the bark was turned <lb/>
            adrift, but the tempest was by no means appeased; they <lb/>
            were still tossed by wave‡ following upon wave, the vessel <lb/>
            suffered much injury, and was in great danger. Having <lb/>
            with difficulty weathered the night, we drove all the next <lb/>
            day, and towards the end of it made land, near the Hera­ <lb/>
            cleotic mouth of the Nile, and, against our wills, disem­ <lb/>
            barked on the coast of Egypt. Our companions were full <lb/>
            of joy; we were overcome with grief, and we felt ill-will to <lb/>
            Neptune for our preservation—we should have preferred a <lb/>
            death free from insult at sea, to a more dreadful expectation <figure type="illustration">

              on land, and a continual exposure to the lawless wills of the <lb/>
              pirates. They began to act in accordance with their nature <lb/>
              on landing; for, proposing to offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving <lb/>
              to Neptune, they brought Tyrian wine, and other requisites <lb/>
              for the ceremony, out of the ship; and sent some of their <lb/>
              comrades with store of money into the country, to buy up <lb/>
              cattle, bidding them pay whatever price was asked. As <lb/>
              soon as these returned with a whole herd of sheep and <lb/>
              swine, the pirates who had stayed behind immediately set <lb/>
              fire to a pile, sacrificed the victims, and prepared the feast.</p>
          <p>" Trachinus took an opportunity of leading me aside, and <lb/>
            thus addressed me ;—‘ Father, I have betrothed your <lb/>
            daughter to myself ; and am preparing to celebrate the <lb/>
            marriage this very day, combining the most delightsome <lb/>
            festival with this sacrifice to the gods. That you may par­ <lb/>
            take cheerfully of the approaching entertainment, and that <lb/>
            you may inform your daughter, who, I hope, will receive the <lb/>
            intimation with joy, I give you this previous notice of my <lb/>
            intentions; not that I want your consent to put them in <lb/>
            execution; my power is a pledge for the performance of my <lb/>
            will : but I have thought it fitting and auspicious to receive <lb/>
            a willing bride from the hands of a parent, who shall have <lb/>
            before apprised and persuaded her.'</p>
          <p>" 1 pretended approval of what he said, and gave thanks <lb/>
            to the gods who had destined my daughter to the honour of <lb/>
            being his spouse; and then retiring, I began to consider <lb/>
            what I could do in this conjuncture. I soon returned, and <lb/>
            besought him that the nuptials might be celebrated with <lb/>
            greater pomp and circumstance than he seemed to hint at <lb/>
            -that he would assign the vessel as a bridal chamber for <lb/>
            Chariclea; that he would give orders that none might enter <lb/>
            or disturb her there, that the might have time to get ready <lb/>
            her wedding dress, and make other needful preparations for <lb/>
            the ceremony; for it would be most unseemly, that she, <lb/>
            whose family was illustrious, and wealth considerable; and <lb/>
            above all, she who was about to be the bride of Trachinus, <lb/>
            should not have what preparation and ornament the present <lb/>
            occasion would permit; although the shortness of the notice, <lb/>
            and inconvenience of the place, would not allow the cele­ <lb/>
            bration of the nuptials with that splendour which was befit­ <lb/>
            ting their station.</p><pb n="126"/>
            
          <p>" Trachinus was overjoyed at hearing me talk in this man­ <lb/>
            ner; and said he would, with the greatest pleasure, order <lb/>
            everything as I desired. In consequence of this, he gave strict <lb/>
            directions that no one should approach the ship after they had <lb/>
            taken everything out of it they wanted. They conveyed out <lb/>
            tables, cups, carpets, canopies-the works* of Tyrian and <lb/>
            Sidonian hands, and every requisite for ministering to and <lb/>
            adorning a feast. They carried in disorder upon their <lb/>
            shoulders, heaps of rich furniture and utensils, collected <lb/>
            with great care and parsimony, but now destined to be de­ <lb/>
            filed by the licentiousness of a tumultuous entertainment. <lb/>
            I took Theagenes, and went to Chariclea; we found her <lb/>
            weeping. ' You are accustomed, my daughter,' said I,‘ to <lb/>
            these reverses, and yet you lament as if they were new to <lb/>
            you. Has any fresh misfortune happened ?'</p>
          <p>" ‘ Everything is unfortunate,' she replied ; ‘ above all, the <lb/>
            fatal passion of Trachinus, which there is now but too much <lb/>
            reason to fear, both from his circumstances and opportu­ <lb/>
            nities, that he will soon attempt to gratify. Unexpected <lb/>
            success inflames the desires of a licentious mind ; but he <lb/>
            shall have reason to rue his detested love. Death, certain <lb/>
            death, shall withdraw me from his pursuit: yet the thought <lb/>
            of being divided from you, and from Theagenes, if such a sepa­ <lb/>
            ration should become necessary, dissolves me into tears.’— <lb/>
            'Your conjectures are but too true,' I replied: 'Trachinus <lb/>
            is resolved to turn the entertainment, which usually follows <lb/>
            a sacrifice, into a nuptial ceremony, and there you are to be <lb/>
            the victim. He discovered his design to me, as to your <lb/>
            father; but I was long ago acquainted with his violent <lb/>
            passion for you, even ever since the conversation which I <lb/>
            had with Tyrrhenus, at Zacynthus. But I concealed what <lb/>
            I knew, that I might not prematurely afflict you with the <lb/>
            dread of impending calamity, especially as I had hopes of <lb/>
            escaping it. But since, my children, fate has ordered other­ <lb/>
            wise, aud we are now in such hazardous circumstances; let <lb/>
            us dare some noble and sudden deed; let us meet this ex­ <lb/>
            tremity of danger courageously, and either preserve our <lb/>
            lives with bravery and freedom, or resign them with forti­ <note type="footnote"> *See IL vL 289. <lb/>

            tude and honour.’ When they had promised to act as I <lb/>
            should order, and I had directed them what they were to <lb/>
            do, I left them to prepare themselves, and sought the pirate <lb/>
            next in command to Trachinus. His name, I think, was <lb/>
            Pelorus: I accosted him and told him that I had something <lb/>
            agreeable to disclose to him. He followed me readily to <lb/>
            a retired place, and I went on :</p>
          <p>it ‘ Son, said I, hear in few words, what I have to say to <lb/>
            you; the opportunity admits not of delay, or long dis­ <lb/>
            course-to be brief, my daughter is in love with you. No <lb/>
            wonder; you have fascinated her with your appearance, but <lb/>
            she suspects that your captain will seize this opportunity of <lb/>
            the sacrifice to marry her himself: for he has ordered her to <lb/>
            be dressed and adorned as elegantly as her present time <lb/>
            admits of. Consider then how you may best frustrate his <lb/>
            intention, and obtain the damsel for yourself, who says she <lb/>
            will rather die than become the spouse of Trachinus.' Pe­ <lb/>
            lorus listened eagerly to me: and then replied, ‘ Be of good <lb/>
            cheer, father; I have long felt an equal affection for your <lb/>
            daughter, and was seeking an opportunity of getting into <lb/>
            her good graces. Trachinus therefore shall either volun­ <lb/>
            tarily resign this maiden to me (to whom besides, I have a <lb/>
            just claim, as having been the first to board your vessel), or <lb/>
            he shall feel the weight of my hand, and his nuptials shall <lb/>
            bear bitter fruits.' After this conversation I retired, that <lb/>
            I might raise no suspicion. I went to my children—I corn­ <lb/>
            forted them—I told them that our scheme was in a very <lb/>
            good train. I supped afterwards with our captors. When <lb/>
            I observed them warm with wine, and ready to be quarrel­ <lb/>
            some, I said softly to Pelorus (for I had designedly placed <lb/>
            myself near him), ‘ Have you seen how the maiden is <lb/>
            adorned ? ’—‘ No, said he.—‘ You may then, if you <lb/>
            please,' I returned, ‘ if you will go aboard the vessel; pri­ <lb/>
            vately though, for Trachinus has forbidden all access to it. <lb/>
            You may there see her sitting, like the goddess Diana; but <lb/>
            moderate your transports; taKe no freedoms, lest you draw <lb/>
            down death both on yourself and her.’</p>
          <p>" After this he took the first opportunity of withdrawing <lb/>
            secretly, and entered with all speed into the ship. He there <lb/>
            beheld Chariclea, with a crown of laurel on her head, and <lb/>
            refulgent in a gold-embroidered robe, (for she had dressed <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            herself in her sacred Delphic garments, which might, as the <lb/>
            ovent should turn out, be either funerer.l or triumphant) ; <lb/>
            everything about her was splendid, and bore the semblance <lb/>
            of a bridal chamber. Pelorus was all on fire at the sight. <lb/>
            Desire and jealousy rnged in his bosom. He returned to <lb/>
            the company, with a look which indicated some furious de­ <lb/>
            sign. Scarcely had he sat down, when he broke out—‘Why <lb/>
            have I not received the reward which is justly due to me for <lb/>
            having first boarded our prize ?’—‘ Because you have not <lb/>
            demanded it,' replied Trachinus. ‘ Besides, there has yet <lb/>
            been no division of the booty.’—‘ I demand then,' said <lb/>
            Pelorus, ‘ the maiden whom we have taken,’—‘ Ask any <lb/>
            thing but her,’ said the captain, ‘ and you shall have it.’— <lb/>
            ‘ Then,’returned the other, 4 you break cutter's law, which <lb/>
            assigns to the first who boards an enemy's ship, and meets <lb/>
            the danger, the free and unrestricted choice of taking what <lb/>
            he will.’—‘ Ido not mean to break our private law,' said <lb/>
            Trachinus ; 'but I rest upon another law, which commands <lb/>
            you all to be obedient to your captain. I have a violent <lb/>
            affection for this maiden—I propose to marry her; and <lb/>
            think I have a right, in this instance, to a preference: if you <lb/>
            oppose my will, this cup which I hold in my hand, shall <lb/>
            make you rue your opposition.' Pelorus, glancing his eyes <lb/>
            on his companiolls—‘ See,' says he, ‘ the guerdon of our <lb/>
            toils ; just so may each of you be deprived of your rewards !' <lb/>
            How, Nausicles, shall I describe the scene which followed? <lb/>
            You might compare the company to the sea agitated by a <lb/>
            sudden squall of wind: rage and wine hurried them head­ <lb/>
            long into the wildest excesses of tumult. Some took part <lb/>
            with their captain, others with his opponent; some called <lb/>
            out to obey their captain, others to vindicate the violated <lb/>
            law. At length Trachinus raised his arm in act to hurl a <lb/>
            goblet at Pelorus; but at that instant the other plunged a <lb/>
            dagger into his side, and he fell dead on the spot. The fray <lb/>
            now became general: dreadful blows were dealt on all sides; <lb/>
            some in revenge of their captain, others in support of Pe­ <lb/>
            lorus ; wounds were inflicted and received by sticks and <lb/>
            stones, by cups and tables-shouts of victory and groans of <lb/>
            defeat resounded everywhere. I retired as far as I could <lb/>
            from the tumult, and gaining a rising ground, became, from <lb/>
            a secure spot, a spectator of the dreadful scene. Theagenes <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            and Chariclea did not escape a share in it; for he, an bad <lb/>
            been before agreed upon, joined himself sword in hand, to <lb/>
            one of the parties, and fought with the utmost fury; she, <lb/>
            when she saw the fight began, shot her arrows from the <lb/>
            ship, sparing only Theagenes. She herself did not join <lb/>
            either side, but aimed at the first fair mark she saw, herself <lb/>
            being all the while concealed, but sufficiently discovering her <lb/>
            enemies by the light of their fires and torches: they, igno­ <lb/>
            rant of the hand which smote them, thought it a prodigy, <lb/>
            and a stroke from heaven.</p>
          <p>"All the crew besides being now stretched on the ground, <lb/>
            Theagenes was left closely engaged in fight with Pelorus, an <lb/>
            antagonist of tried courage, exercised in many a scene of <lb/>
            bloodshed. Chariclea could now no longer assist him with her <lb/>
            shafts, she dreaded lest in this hand-to-hand engagement, she <lb/>
            might wound her lover instead of his antagonist. The event <lb/>
            of the fight was for some time doubtful; at length Pelorus <lb/>
            began to give way. Chariclea, deprived of all other means of <lb/>
            assisting him, encouraged him with her voice. " Be strong," <lb/>
            she cried out, “ be of good cheer, take courage, my life!"</p>
          <p>“Her words inspired her lover with fresh spirit and reso­ <lb/>
            lution : they reminded him, that she, the prize of victory, <lb/>
            still lived. Regardless of several wounds which he had re­ <lb/>
            ceived, he now made a desperate effort, rushed upon Pelo­ <lb/>
            rus, and aimed a fearful sword-cut at his head; a sudden <lb/>
            swerve occasioned him to miss his blow, but his blade <lb/>
            descended on his enemy's shoulder, and lopped off his arm <lb/>
            above the elbow. The barbarian now had recourse to flight; <lb/>
            Theagenes pursued hint. What followed 1 am not able to <lb/>
            relate--he came back without my perceiving it. I still re­ <lb/>
            mained on the eminence to which 1 had retired, not daring, <lb/>
            in the night time, to proceed any farther in a hostile country. <lb/>
            But he had not escaped the eye of Chariclea. I saw him at <lb/>
            break of day lying, in a manner, dead; the sitting by, la­ <lb/>
            menting, and ready to kill herself upon him, but restrained <lb/>
            by a glimmering of hope that he might still survive. I, <lb/>
            thunderstruck at the suddenness with which our misfortunes <lb/>
            by land had succeeded those by sea, was not able to speak. <lb/>
            I could neither inquire into the particulars of the situation <lb/>
            in which he had returned, nor attempt to comfort her, nor <lb/>
            relieve him. <note type="footnote"> It </note> <pb n="130"/>
            </p>
          <p>“At break of day, after I had descended from my emi­ <lb/>
            nence, I saw a band of Egyptian pirates coming down from <lb/>
            a mountain which overlooked the sea.* In a twinkling they <lb/>
            had seized, and were carrying off, the youthful pair, together <lb/>
            with what plunder they could take with them from the ship. <lb/>
            I followed them at a distance, lamenting my own, and my <lb/>
            children's misfortunes, unable to succour them, and thinking <lb/>
            it best not to join them; cherishing some faint hope of <lb/>
            future assistance. But I soon felt my own unfitness for <lb/>
            the task, being left far behind by the Egyptians, and unable <lb/>
            to follow them through steep and rugged roads. Since that <lb/>
            time, until the recovery of my daughter, by the favour of <lb/>
            the gods, and your goodness, 0 Nausicles, my days have <lb/>
            passed in sorrow and tears."</p>
          <p>Having said this, lie wept. All who beard him wept with <lb/>
            him ; and a lamentation, not wholly unmixed with pleasure, <lb/>
            pervaded the whole company. Tears readily flow when the <lb/>
            head is warm with wine. At length Nausicles applied him­ <lb/>
            self to comfort Calasiris.</p>
          <p>“Father," said he, “ be of good cheer, you have already <lb/>
            recovered your daughter, and this night alone divides you <lb/>
            from the presence of your son. To-morrow we will wait <lb/>
            upon Mithranes, and do all in our power to ransom and free <lb/>
            Theagenes.”—“ No wish is nearer to my heart," replied Ca­ <lb/>
            lasiris, " but it is now time to break up our entertainment: <lb/>
            let us remember the gods, and join with our libations, <lb/>
            thanksgiving for my child's deliverance." Upon this the <lb/>
            vases for libation were carried round, and the company dis­ <lb/>
            persed.</p>
          <p>Calasiris looked about for Chariclea; and having long <lb/>
            watched the crowd as they came out, and not seeing her, at <lb/>
            length ho inquired for her of one of the women, and by her <lb/>
            information went into the temple, where ho found her fallen <lb/>
            into a deep sleep, embracing the feet of the imago of tho <lb/>
            deity, wearied by long prayer, and exhausted by grief. He <lb/>
            dropped a tear over her, breathed out a petition for her hap­ <lb/>
            piness, and, gently waking her, conducted her to his lodging, <lb/>
            blushing at her imprudence, in having suffered herself to be <lb/>
            surprised by sleep in such a place. Here, in her chamber, <note type="footnote"> *See Book I. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            with the daughter of Nausicles, she laid herself down to <lb/>
            rest, but wakefulness compelled her to ruminate upon her <lb/>
            Borrows.</p>

          <p>CALASIRIS and Cnemon betook themselves to their apart- <lb/>
            merits on the men's side of the house, and composed them­ <lb/>
            selves to rest. The night was quickly past, great part of it <lb/>
            having been consumed in the preceding feast, and subse­ <lb/>
            quent narration; but it passed too slowly for their impa­ <lb/>
            tience ; and almost before day they were up, and presented <lb/>
            themselves to Nausicles, urging him to inform them where <lb/>
            he thought Theagenes was, and to lead them to him as soon : <lb/>
            as possible. He was not slow in complying with their re­ <lb/>
            quest, and they set out under his direction. Chariclea was <lb/>
            very earnest to accompany them, but they pressed, and at <lb/>
            last obliged, her to remain where she was ; Nausicles assur­ <lb/>
            ing her that they were not going far, and that they would <lb/>
            soon return, and bring Theagenes with them. Here then <lb/>
            they left her, struggling between sorrow for their departure, <lb/>
            and joy for the promised hope of seeing her lover.</p>
          <p>They had scarcely got out of the village, and were pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding along the banks of the Nile, when they saw a <lb/>
            crocodile creeping from the right side of the river to the left, <lb/>
            and making his way swiftly down the stream. The rest of <lb/>
            the party being used to the sight, regarded it with indiffer­ <lb/>
            ence, although Calasiris secretly thought that it portended <lb/>
            some impediment in their expedition. But Cnemon was <lb/>
            very much frightened at its appearance, though he could <lb/>
            hardly be said to have seen the animal itself, but had rather <lb/>
            had a glimpse of the shadow : he was so terrified as almost <lb/>
            to run away. Nausicles burst into a laugh. " Cnemon.” <lb/>
            said Calasiris, " I thought you were apt to be terrified only <lb/>
            in the darkness and obscurity of the night; but I see your <lb/>
            courage shows itself even in the day-time. It is not only <lb/>
            names that affright you,* but the commonest and most <lb/>
            every-day appearance puts you quite into a trepidation.”— <note type="footnote"> See Book V. </note> <note type="footnote"> X 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            Is Prithee tell me what god, or what demon is it,” said <lb/>
            Nausicles, “ whose name this valiant Grecian cannot bear P ”</p>
          <p>" If it were the name of a deity," replied the old man, <lb/>
            “there might be something in it; but it is the appellation <lb/>
            of a mortal, and that not of a celebrated hero, nor even of a <lb/>
            man; but of a weak woman, and, as he says, of a dead one <lb/>
            too, at the mention of which he is disordered and trembles. <lb/>
            That night in which you returned from the buccaneers, <lb/>
            bringing with you my dearest Chariclea, this said name was, <lb/>
            somehow or other, mentioned in his hearing: it put him <lb/>
            into such an agitation, that he bad no sleep all night, nor <lb/>
            suffered me to enjoy any; he was half dead with fear, and I <lb/>
            had the greatest difficulty in the world to bring him to him­ <lb/>
            self; and were I not afraid of terrifying, or giving him pain, <lb/>
            I would now mention the name, that you might laugh the <lb/>
            more : "-and immediately be uttered the word Thisbe. But <lb/>
            Nausicles did not laugh, as he expected; he became grave <lb/>
            and pensive, doubting and pondering why and by reason of <lb/>
            what intimacy Cnernon felt so much at the mention of Thisbe. <lb/>
            Cnemon upon this burst out into an immoderate fit of <lb/>
            laughter in his turn. “See,” said he, " my dear Cabins, <lb/>
            the mighty magic of this name; it is not only a bugbear <lb/>
            which disturbs, as you say, all my faculties, but it has the <lb/>
            same effect upon Nausicles; with this difference, however, <lb/>
            that the certainty of her death inclines me to laughter, when <lb/>
            the same news seems to make him sorrowful, who was be­ <lb/>
            fore so disposed to be merry at the expense of others.”— <lb/>
            ‘ Spare me,’ said Nausicles ; ‘ you have sufficiently revenged <lb/>
            yourself : but I conjure you by the gods of hospitality <lb/>
            and friendship—by the kind and sincere reception which <lb/>
            you have met with at my house and table-that you will tell <lb/>
            me how you became so well acquainted with the name of <lb/>
            Thisbe—whether you really have known her, or only pre­ <lb/>
            tend to have done so, out of sport, and to vex me ? ”—“ It <lb/>
            is now your turn, Cnemon,” said Calasiris, “ to turn narra­ <lb/>
            tor. You have frequently promised to make me acquainted <lb/>
            with your condition and adventures, and as often, Oil some <lb/>
            pretext or other, have put it off: you cannot have a better <lb/>
            opportunity of doing so than the present: you will oblige <lb/>
            both Nausicles and Tile; and lighten, by your story, the <lb/>
            fatigues of our journey."</p><pb n="133"/>
            
          <p>Cnemon suffered himself to be persuaded, and entered <lb/>
            upon his history, relating briefly, what he had before told <lb/>
            more at length to Theagenes ana Chariclea—That he was <lb/>
            an Athenian—that his father was Aristippus, and his step­ <lb/>
            mother Demæneta—her execrable love, and the snares she <lb/>
            laid for him on its disappointment, by the ministry of Thisbe <lb/>
            -the particulars of these-his flight from his country, and <lb/>
            condemnation as a parricide-his exile at Ægina—his hear­ <lb/>
            ing from Charias of the death of Demæneta, betrayed by her <lb/>
            own wicked assistant Thisbe—what Anticles related to him <lb/>
            of the distress his father fell into; the family of Demæneta <lb/>
            combining against him, and persuading the people that he <lb/>
            had murdered her-the flight of Thisbe from Athens, with a <lb/>
            Naucratian merchant, who was in love with her—his sailing <lb/>
            with Anticles to Egypt, in search of Thisbe; in order, if lie <lb/>
            could find her, to bring her back to Athens, to clear his <lb/>
            father, and punish her—the various difficulties and dangers <lb/>
            he went through, both by sea and pirates—how, having es­ <lb/>
            caped these, and arrived in Egypt, lie was again taken by <lb/>
            the pirates—his meeting and connection with Theagenes <lb/>
            and Chariclea—the death of Thisbe—and every thing in <lb/>
            order, till he came to his meeting with Calasiris and Nau­ <lb/>
            sicles, and to those facts and events with which they were <lb/>
            acquainted.</p>
          <p>Nausicles meanwhile revolved a thousand thoughts in his <lb/>
            mind—now he was about to disclose all his transactions with <lb/>
            Thisbe, and now inclined to defer it to another opportunity; <lb/>
            but his eagerness for speaking had almost got the better of <lb/>
            him, when some remains of reserve, and an accident which <lb/>
            happened by the way, prevented his unbosoming himself for <lb/>
            the present. They had travelled about eight miles, and <lb/>
            were near to the village where Mithranes dwelt, when Nau­ <lb/>
            sicles meeting an acquaintance, inquired whither he was <lb/>
            going in so much haste.</p>
          <p>" Do you not know," he replied, " that all my exertions <lb/>
            have now but one aim, that of executing the behests of <lb/>
            Isiasof Chemmis ? I labour for her, I supply her with <lb/>
            every thing the wants. I wake day and night in her tier­ <lb/>
            vice. I refuse no commission, small or great, which the <lb/>
            dear Isias imposes on me, though toil and loss are all I have <lb/>
            hitherto gotten for my pains. I am now making what <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            haste I can with this bird which you see, a flamingo * of the <lb/>
            Nile, carrying it to my mistress, according to her com­ <lb/>
            mands."—" What an amiable mistress you have got," said <lb/>
            Nausicles, " how light are her commands! how fortunate <lb/>
            you are that she has not ordered you to bring her a phœnix, <lb/>
            instead of a phcenicopter! ”—“She does all these things,” <lb/>
            said the other, “ out of wanton sport to make a jest of me— <lb/>
            but may I ask where you are bending your course ? "</p>
          <p>When he had learned that they were going to Mithranes <lb/>
            —“ You are on a sleeveless errand," said he, “I for Mithranes <lb/>
            is not now here ; he has this evening led out his troops on <lb/>
            an expedition against the buccaneers of Bessus; for Thyamis, <lb/>
            their leader, has made an incursion into his territories, and <lb/>
            taken from him one of his captives, a Grecian youth, whom <lb/>
            he was preparing to send to Oroondates, at Memphis; and <lb/>
            from thence, as I suppose, as a present to the Great King. <lb/>
            But I must be gone to Isias, (who is now, perhaps, looking <lb/>
            for me with eager eyes), lest my delay offend my charmer ; <lb/>
            she is but too ready to seize a pretence, however slight, to <lb/>
            flout and quarrel with me.” While these words were yet <lb/>
            in his mouth, he hurried off, leaving his hearers confused <lb/>
            and stupified at his tidings.</p>
          <p>Nausicles was the first who broke silence. He tried to <lb/>

            as well to consult upon what they had farther to do, as to <lb/>

            of finding and recovering him : for he conceived that it was <lb/>
            not without some kind interposition of Providence, that <lb/>
            they had so fortunately met with an acquaintance whose <lb/>

            pointed out to them the pirate-settlement, as the first place <lb/>
            where they were to seek their friend.</p>
          <p>They assented, without difficulty, to his proposal; what <lb/>
            they had heard giving them a glimmering hope, and Cnemon <lb/>
            privately assuring Calasiris that he was sure that Thyamis <lb/>
            would watch over the safety of Theagenes. They deter­ <lb/>
            mined therefore to return to Chemmis, where, being arrived, <lb/>
            they found Chariclea at the house door, with outstretched <lb/>
            neck and eager eyes, looking on every side for their appear­ <lb/>
            ance. As soon as she saw them, and no Theagenes with <lb/>
            them, fetching a deep and melancholy sigh—“Are you <lb/>
            alone ! " she cried, “Father? Do you return even as you set <lb/>
            out?—Theagenes then is no more ! Tell me, by the gods I <lb/>
            beseech you, if you have any tidings for me! and whatever <lb/>
            they may be, do not increase my misery by delaying them. <lb/>
            There is a degree of humanity in discovering quickly unfor­ <lb/>
            tunate intelligence : the soul collects at once all its powers <lb/>
            of resistance, and the shock is sooner over.”</p>
          <p>Cnemon hastening to repress her rising anguish—“ How <lb/>
            ready are you," said he, " to foretell calamities! You gene­ <lb/>
            rally, however, prove a false prophetess, and so far you do <lb/>
            well—Theagenes is not only living, but, I trust in the gods, <lb/>
            safe; ”—and lie told her, briefly, in what condition, and <lb/>
            where he was. " Ah, Cnemon!” said Calasiris, “ one would <lb/>
            think, from what you say, that you had never been in love! <lb/>
            Do not you know that they who really love are apprehen­ <lb/>
            sive of the slightest trifles, and believe only their own eyes, <lb/>
            when the situation of their lovers is concerned ? Absence <lb/>
            always fills their languishing souls with fear and torment; <lb/>
            they'imagine that nothing but the most invincible necessity <lb/>
            can ever make them separate from each other. Forgive, <lb/>
            Chariclea, therefore, who labours under the extremity of <lb/>
            this passion, and let us enter the house, and consider what <lb/>
            we have to do ; ”—and taking Charicleas hand, and sooth. <lb/>
            ing her with paternal tenderness, he led her in.</p>
          <p>Nausicles, willing to solace his friends after their fatigues, <lb/>
            and having, besides, a farther private end of his own, pre­ <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            pared a more than usually choice entertainment for them <lb/>
            alone and his daughter, whom be commanded to dress and <lb/>
            adorn herself with uncommon bravery and splendour. To­ <lb/>
            wards the end of the feast be thus addressed them:</p>
          <p>“I call the gods to witness, my friends, that your com­ <lb/>
            pany is so agreeable to me, that I should be happy if you <lb/>
            would spend the remainder of your lives here, and enjoy, in <lb/>
            common with me, my wealth and pleasures. I wish to con­ <lb/>
            sider you so much more in the light of friends than guests, <lb/>
            that I shall think nothing too much which I can bestow upon, <lb/>
            or partake with you. I am ready also to give you every <lb/>
            advice and assistance in my power, towards the recovery of <lb/>
            Your lost relation, as long as I can stay with you ; but you <lb/>
            know that I am a merchant, and that it is by this profession <lb/>
            that I procure and increase my substance. And now, as <lb/>
            the west winds have set in favourably, have opened the sea <lb/>
            for navigation, and promise a prosperous season, my affairs <lb/>
            call loudly upon me to sail into Greece. I am very desirous, <lb/>
            therefore, of hearing what you propose to do, that I may <lb/>
            endeavour, as much as possible, to accommodate my schemes <lb/>
            to yours." Here he paused; and Calasiris, after a short <lb/>
            pause, answered him :—" 0 Nausicles! may your voyage be <lb/>
            fortunate !—may Hermes, the patron of gain, and Neptune <lb/>
            the preserver, protect and accompany your expedition-may <lb/>
            they lead yoa through smooth seas, may they make every <lb/>
            haven safe very city easy of access to you, and every <lb/>
            inhabitant favourable to your undertakings—these are the <lb/>
            sincere and grateful wishes of those whom you have re­ <lb/>
            ceived, and now, at their own request, dismiss after observ­ <lb/>
            ing the exact law of friendship and hospitality. Though it <lb/>
            is grievous and painful to us to leave you, and to depart <lb/>
            from your house, which with so much generosity you have <lb/>
            taught us in a manner to consider as our own; yet it is <lb/>
            incumbent upon, and unavoidable for us, to apply ourselves <lb/>
            immediately to the search and recovery of our lost friend. <lb/>
            This is the fixed purpose of myself and Chariclea: let Cne­ <lb/>
            mon speak for himself—whether he had rather gratify us, <lb/>
            by accompanying us in our wanderings, or has any other <lb/>
            project in his mind.” Cnemon seemed now desirous of <lb/>
            answering in his turn; and, preparing to speak, fetched, on <lb/>
            a sudden, a deep sigh, and tears for some time stopped his <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            utterance: at length collecting and composing himself as <lb/>
            well as he could, he said­</p>
          <p>" 0 fortune, fickle and uncertain goddess! how dost thou <lb/>
            shower down misfortunes upon its miserable mortals! but <lb/>
            upon none have thy persecutions been exerted with more <lb/>
            unremitting severity than upon me. You deprived me of <lb/>
            my family and fathei's house; banished me from my country <lb/>
            and friends-after a long interval of calamities which I pass <lb/>
            over, shipwrecked me upon the coast of Egypt; delivered <lb/>
            me over to pirates; shewed me, at last, a glimmering of <lb/>
            comfort, by making me acquainted with men, unfortunate, <lb/>
            indeed, like myself, but at the same time Greeks, and such <lb/>
            as I hoped to spend the remainder of my life with ; but <lb/>
            now you deprive me of this consolation, where shall 1 turn <lb/>
            myself? What ought I to do? Shall I desert Chariclea, <lb/>
            who has not vet recovered Theagenes? That would be in­ <lb/>
            . famous and abominable ? Or shall I follow and attend her <lb/>
            in her search ? If there were a probable prospect of finding <lb/>
            him, the hope of success would sweeten, and authorize my <lb/>
            toils; but if that expectation is distant and uncertain, and <lb/>
            the undertaking discouraging and difficult, who can tell <lb/>
            where my wanderings will end? May I not, then, hope that <lb/>
            you, and the deities of friendship, will forgive me, if I ven­ <lb/>
            ture to mention a return to my family and country ? espe­ <lb/>
            cially since the gods offer me so unlooked-for an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, in the voyage which Nausicles proposes making into <lb/>
            Greece. Ought I to let slip so favourable an occasion ? <lb/>
            since, should any thing have happened to my father, his <lb/>
            house will be left desolate, and his name and estate without <lb/>
            a successor: and though I may be destined to spend the <lb/>
            remainder of my days in poverty, yet it will be desirable and <lb/>
            right in me, to preserve in my own person the remnant of <lb/>
            my race. But, O Chariclea! I am most anxious to excuse <lb/>
            myself to you, and to beg your forgiveness, which I beseech <lb/>
            you to grant me. I will follow you as far as the quar­ <lb/>
            ters of the buccaners; and will beg the favour of Nau­ <lb/>
            sicles, however pressed he may be in time, to wait for me <lb/>
            so long. If perchance I should be so fortunate as to deliver <lb/>
            you there into the hands of Theagenes, I shall then appear to <lb/>
            have been a faithful guardian of the precious deposit which <lb/>
            has fallen under my care, and shall set out on my own expe­ <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            dition with lucky omens, and a quiet conscience. But if <lb/>
            (which the gods forbid!) I should be deceived in this hope, <lb/>
            I shall still, I trust, appear excusable, in that I have gone <lb/>
            so far, and have not left you alone, but in the hands of <lb/>
            the excellent Calasiris, your father, and best preserver."</p>
          <p>Chariclea meanwhile conjecturing, from many circum­ <lb/>
            stances, that Cnemon was in love with the daughter of Nau. <lb/>
            Bides (for one who is herself enamoured most easily detects <lb/>
            the like affections in another), and seeing, from the beha­ <lb/>
            viour and expressions of Nausicles, that he was very desirous <lb/>
            for the alliance, that he had long been working at it, and <lb/>
            endeavouring to allure Cnemon into it; and thinking it, <lb/>
            besides, not perfectly proper, or free from suspicion, that ho <lb/>
            should any longer be the companion of her journey—“ My <lb/>
            friend," said she, " let us entreat you to act as is most <lb/>
            agreeable to yourself: receive our best and most grateful <lb/>
            thanks for all the favours you have bestowed upon us, and <lb/>
            the good offices you have performed. For the future we <lb/>
            have not so much need of your cares and attention, nor is <lb/>
            there now any necessity that you should endanger your own <lb/>
            fortunes, by waiting any longer upon ours. Go, then, under <lb/>
            happy auspices, to Athens; may you there again find your <lb/>
            family, and recover your estate. It would be blamcable in <lb/>
            you to neglect the opportunity which Nausicles offers you : <lb/>
            I and Calasiris will struggle with the cross accidents which <lb/>
            pursue us, till we may perhaps, at last, find some end to our <lb/>
            wanderings. If we meet with no assistance from men, the <lb/>
            gods, we trust, will not forsake us.”</p>
          <p>" May the immortals,” said Nausicles, " accompany Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea, according to her prayers, and assist her in every <lb/>
            thing! and may she soon recover her friend and parents: <lb/>
            her generous spirit and excellent understanding well deserve <lb/>
            success. Do you, Cnemon, regret no longer that you do <lb/>
            not bring Thisbe back again with you to Athens, especially <lb/>
            when you may accuse me of having carried her off clan­ <lb/>
            destinely from thence; for the merchant of Naucratium, <lb/>
            the lover of Thisbe, was no other than myself; nor have you <lb/>
            any reason to apprehend distress or poverty. If your incli­ <lb/>
            nations coincide with mine, you may not only recover your <lb/>
            country and family, under my guidance, but enrich yourself <lb/>
            to the extent of any reasonable desires. If you are willing <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            to marry, I offer you my daughter, Nausiclea, with an ample <lb/>
            portion, judging that I have received enough in that I have <lb/>
            learned your family and nation."</p>
          <p>Cnemon, seeing what had long been the object of his <lb/>
            wishes and prayers, now unexpectedly offered him beyond <lb/>
            his hopes, eagerly replied, " I take your offer with great joy, <lb/>
            and gratitude and Nausicles immediately delivered his <lb/>
            daughter into his outstretched hand, and betrothed her to <lb/>
            him; and ordering those who were present to raise the nup­ <lb/>
            tial song, he himself opened the dance, making the enter­ <lb/>
            tainment furnish forth a sudden wedding.</p>
          <p>All the company were engaged in this joyous ceremony, <lb/>
            the more pleasant, because unlocked for: the song resounded <lb/>
            through the apartments, and during the whole night, the <lb/>
            house shone with the marriage torches. But Chariclea, <lb/>
            retiring from the rest, betook herself to her solitary chamber; <lb/>
            where, having secured the door, and risking as she thought <lb/>
            no intrusion, she surrendered herself to all the stings ot <lb/>
            frenzy. She let her dishevelled tresses fall upon her <lb/>
            shoulders, tore and discomposed her garments, and thus <lb/>
            broke out;—“ Aye ! let me too, in the manner he likes best, <lb/>
            lead the dance before the overruling evil-genius ; let lamen­ <lb/>
            tations be my songs, and tears my libations: let darkness <lb/>
            surround me, and obscure night preside over what I am <lb/>
            about;" and with this she extinguished her torch against <lb/>
            the ground. “ What a dainty nuptial chamber has he pro­ <lb/>
            vided me! He claims me for himself, and keeps me soli­ <lb/>
            tary. Cnemon marries and joins in the dance; Theagenes <lb/>
            wanders a captive, perhaps, and in bonds ; and provided he <lb/>
            lives even that were well. Nausiclea is betrothed and sepa­ <lb/>
            rated from me, who, till this night, partook of my bed ; and <lb/>
            I am left alone and destitute. Heaven knows that I grudge <lb/>
            them not their good fortune; I wish them all felicity ; but <lb/>
            I repine that I have no share of it myself. The tragedy of <lb/>
            my misfortunes has been prolonged beyond example. But <lb/>
            what avails it to spend my time in womanish lamentations! <lb/>
            let the measure of my calamities be filled up, since such is <lb/>
            the will of heaven. But, 0 Theagenes, my sweet and only <lb/>
            care, if you are dead, and the dreadful tidings (which may <lb/>
            the gods forbid!) should ever wound my ear, I swear <lb/>
            instantly to join you in the shades below. Meanwhile let <lb/>
            me offer to your spirit (if it has left the lovely body) these <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            funeral rites (and immediately she plucked off handful. of <lb/>
            her hair and laid them on the bed) : “ Let me pour a liba­ <lb/>
            tion to you out of those eyes which you hold so dear;” and <lb/>
            with this she bedewed her couch with her tears. " But, <lb/>
            if you are alive and safe, appear to me, my life, in a <lb/>
            dream ; and repose with me, but preserve, even then, the <lb/>
            respect you have sworn to, your betrothed." So sayin?, <lb/>
            she flung herself on the bed, embraced and kissed it; till <lb/>
            sobs and groans, fatigue and grief, gradually overwhelmed <lb/>
            as with a cloud all her reasoning faculties ; and she sunk, <lb/>
            at last, into a deep sleep, which continued till late the <lb/>
            following morning.</p>
          <p>Calasiris, wondering that she did not appear as usual, <lb/>
            went up to her chamber to inquire after her; where, knock. <lb/>
            ing loudly at the door, and calling her repeatedly by her <lb/>
            name, he at length awakened her. She, alarmed at this <lb/>
            sudden call, and confused at the disorder both of her person <lb/>
            and apartment; yet, went to the door, unbolted it, and let <lb/>
            him in. He, when he saw her hair dishevelled, her gar­ <lb/>
            ments torn, her eyes restless, and breathing still too much <lb/>
            of that passion with which they had been inflamed before <lb/>
            she dropped asleep, began to suspect something of the cause <lb/>
            of this agitation. Leading her, therefore, again to the bed, <lb/>
            placing her upon it, and helping her to compose her dress a <lb/>
            little—“ Why, Chariclea,” says he, " do you indulge these <lb/>
            transports ? Why do you grieve thus beyond measure, and <lb/>
            abjectly sink under the calamities which oppress you ? I <lb/>
            am now at a loss to discover that nobleness of mind, and <lb/>
            chastened spirit, with which you have hitherto borne your <lb/>
            ills. Have done with these unbecoming extravagancies— <lb/>
            consider that you are a mortal creature;. a thing unstable, <lb/>
            subject to the blasts of good and evil fortune. Why <lb/>
            abandon yourself to despair, perhaps, on the eve of a change <lb/>
            of fortune ? Preserve yourself, my child; if not for your own <lb/>
            Bake, at least for Theagenes, who lives only in and for you.”</p>
          <p>Chariclea blushed at his chiding, and at the circumstances <lb/>
            in which he had surprised her. She was for some time <lb/>
            silent. At last she said—“ You have reason, I own, to <note type="footnote"> “ . ....ye men, ye brittle things, mere images of clay, <lb/>
            Ye flitting leaves, ye shadowy shapes, ye creatures of a day, <lb/>

            blame me, Father: but, perhaps, you will not think me <lb/>
            without excuse. My love for Theagenes is no new or vulgar <lb/>
            passion, but pure and chaste; it is directed towards one <lb/>
            who, though not my wedded husband, is my betrothed: <lb/>
            I am grieved and disappointed at not seeing him return with <lb/>
            you; and am in a thousand doubts and fears about his life <lb/>
            and safety."</p>
          <p>" Be comforted then," replied Calasiris, " trust in the <lb/>
            oracles of the gods, and believe, that under their guidance <lb/>
            and protection, he is both safe and well. You should re­ <lb/>
            member what we heard yesterday-that he was taken by <lb/>
            Thyamis, as he was being carried to Memphis; and, if he is <lb/>
            in his power, you may be satisfied that he is safe ; for there <lb/>
            was a friendship between them even before. It is our <lb/>
            business now to make what haste we can to the town of <lb/>
            Bessa, in order to seek, you for your lover, and I for my son ; <lb/>
            for you have already heard that Thyamis stands in that <lb/>
            relation to me."</p>
          <p>Chariclea appeared very pensive at this.—“ If indeed," <lb/>
            said she, " this is your son, and not some other Thyamis, our <lb/>
            affairs are in great jeopardy." Calasiris wondering at, and <lb/>
            inquiring the cause of, her apprehensions,—“ You know," <lb/>
            she continued, " that I was for some time in the power of <lb/>
            the pirates: there these unhappy features of mine inspired <lb/>
            Thyamis with love. I fear lest, if in our inquiry we should <lb/>
            meet with him, he should immediately recognize me, and <lb/>
            compel me to a marriage which, on various pretences, I <lb/>
            before with difficulty eluded.”—I trust," said the old man, <lb/>
            " that the sight of me will inspire him with reverence and <lb/>
            respect, and that a father's eye will repress and restrain his <lb/>
            intemperate desires: however, there is no reason why we <lb/>
            should not endeavour, by some artifice, to guard against <lb/>
            what you fear; and you seem expert at finding out ex­ <lb/>
            cuses and delays, against those who show themselves too <lb/>
            pressing."</p>
          <p>Chariclea, recovering her spirits a little at this pleasantry <lb/>
            —“ I do not know whether you are in jest or earnest: <lb/>
            said she, “ but I can relate to you the contrivance of Thea­ <lb/>
            genes and myself, when we attempted to make our escape <lb/>
            from the pirates' island; and, if you approve of it, we may <lb/>
            make use now of the same stratagem ; and may it be more <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            fortunate than it was then! We determined to change <lb/>
            our garments, to metamorpbose ourselves into beggars, and <lb/>
            in this squalid garb to pass through the towns and villages. <lb/>
            Let us now then, if you please, put on the appearance of <lb/>
            wretchedness: we shall be less subject to inquiry and obser­ <lb/>
            vation. The greatest security is found in the lowest estate. <lb/>
            Poverty is an object of pity, not of envy; and we shall more <lb/>
            easily procure our daily bread: for, in a foreign land, every <lb/>
            thing is sold dear to strangers ; but is cheaply given to the <lb/>
            wretched."</p>
          <p>Calasiris approved of the project, and besought her to be <lb/>
            ready as soon as possible to set out. They acquainted <lb/>
            Nausicles and Cnemon with their intentions, and in three <lb/>
            days were prepared to enter on their expedition. They <lb/>
            took no beast of burden with them, though they might have <lb/>
            had one, nor suffered any one to attend them. Nausicles <lb/>
            and Cnemon, and all their family, accompanied them as far <lb/>
            as they would permit it. Nausiclea, too, having by earnest <lb/>
            entreaties obtained her father's permission, set out with her <lb/>
            friend; her love for Chariclea making her break through <lb/>
            that reserve and retirement which young women arc ex­ <lb/>
            pected to preserve during the first days of their nuptials. <lb/>
            They accompanied them about half a mile; and then, salut­ <lb/>
            ing each other, and mingling tears and every good wish <lb/>
            with their embraces, they took their leave. Cnemon re­ <lb/>
            peatedly besought them to pardon those nuptial engage­ <lb/>
            ments which prevented his going with them; and promised <lb/>
            that, whenever he had an opportunity, he would endeavour <lb/>
            to find them out.</p>
          <p>At length they separated. Nausicles, and his train, took <lb/>
            the road to Chemmis. Chariclea and Calasiris began the <lb/>
            transformation which they had meditated, and clothed them­ <lb/>
            selves in tattered garments, which they had got ready. <lb/>
            She stained her cheeks with a compound of soot and dust,. <note type="footnote"> * “ ......Whiles I may 'scape <lb/>

            and threw an old torn veil negligently over her face. She <lb/>
            carried a bag under her arm, which had the appearance of <lb/>
            being a receptacle for scraps and broken victuals, but con­ <lb/>
            tained, in reality, the sacred vestments she had brought <lb/>
            from Delphi-her garlands, and the precious tokens which <lb/>
            her mother had exposed with her.</p>
          <p>Calasiris carried her quiver, wrapt up in a piece of old <lb/>
            leather, as a burden, across his shoulders; and, loosening <lb/>
            the string of her bow, made use of it as a walking-stick. If <lb/>
            any one approached, he leant heavily upon it, stooping more <lb/>
            than his years actually obliged him to do; and, limping <lb/>
            with one leg, suffered himself frequently to be led by <lb/>
            Chariclea.</p>
          <p>When the metamorphosis was completed they could not <lb/>
            help smiling at each other's appearance, and, in the midst <lb/>
            of their grief, a few jokes upon it escaped them; and <lb/>
            beseeching the deities who persecuted them to cease at <lb/>
            length from their anger, they made what haste they could <lb/>
            to the town of Bessa, where they hoped to find Theagenes <lb/>
            and Thyamis. But in. this they were disappointed; for <lb/>
            arriving near Bessa at sun-setting, they saw the ground <lb/>
            strewed with a considerable number of dead bodies, newly <lb/>
            slain; most of them were Persians, whom they knew by <lb/>
            their habits, but some were the natives of the place. They <lb/>
            conjectured this to have been the work of war, but were at <lb/>
            a loss to know who had been the combatants. At length, <lb/>
            while they were searching and examining the corpses, <lb/>
            dreading lest they might find a friend among them (for <lb/>
            strong affection is unreasonably apprehensive on the slightest <lb/>
            grounds), they saw an old woman, hanging over the body of <lb/>
            one of the natives, and loud in her lamentations. They <lb/>
            resolved therefore to endeavour to get what intelligence <lb/>
            they could from her; and, accosting her, they first tried to <lb/>
            soothe her vehement affliction; and then, when she became <lb/>
            a little calmer, Calasiris, in the Egyptian tongue, ventured <lb/>
            to ask her what was the cause of the slaughter they saw <lb/>
            before them, and who it was whom she so lamented. She <lb/>
            answered, briefly, that she was mourning for her son; that <lb/>
            she came on purpose to the field of battle that some one of <lb/>
            the combatants, if any should return, might deprive her of <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            life, now become a burden to her; that meanwhile, amid <lb/>
            tears and lamentations, she was endeavouring, as well as <lb/>
            site could, to perform funeral rites for her child. The <lb/>
            cause of the engagement, says she, was as follows:-" A <lb/>
            foreign youth, of remarkable beauty and stature, was pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding under the direction of Mithranes, the Persian <lb/>
            Commandant, in his way to Memphis, where he was to <lb/>
            be- presented to Oroondates, the Viceroy of the Great King. <lb/>
            Mithranes had taken him captive, and thought he could not <lb/>
            offer a more agreeable gift. The inhabitants of our towr <lb/>
            pretending, whether truly or not 1 cannot say, that they <lb/>
            had some knowledge of this young man, came suddenly <lb/>
            upon the soldiers of Mithranes, and rescued him. Mithranes, <lb/>
            when he beard of it, was violently enraged, and two days <lb/>
            ago led his troops against the town. My countrymen are <lb/>
            used to war; they lead a piratical life, and despise death <lb/>
            when gain or revenge are in view. Many are the widows <lb/>
            and orphans they have made, and many mothers have they <lb/>
            deprived of their children, as I, unhappy woman, am at this <lb/>
            day. As soon, therefore, as they had certain intelligence <lb/>
            of the Persians' expedition, they left the city, chose a <lb/>
            proper place for an ambuscade, and posting, in concealment, <lb/>
            a select body of troops where they knew the enemy must <lb/>
            pass, as soon as they appeared, attacked them resolutely <lb/>
            in front, while the rest of their companions rushed suddenly, <lb/>
            with a great shout, from their ambush, fell upon their flank, <lb/>
            and soon put them to the rout. Mithranes fell among the <lb/>
            first, and most of his troops with him; for they were so <lb/>
            surrounded, that there was little opportunity for night. A <lb/>
            few of our people were slain, and among those few my son, <lb/>
            transfixed, as lou see, with a Persian dart; and now I, <lb/>
            unhappy that I' am, am bewailing his loss; and, perhaps, <lb/>
            am still reserved to lament that of the only son I have now <lb/>
            let t, who marched yesterday with the army against the city <lb/>
            of Memphis.”</p>
          <p>Calasiris inquired into the cause of this expedition. The <lb/>
            old woman told him what sibe had heard from her son: <lb/>
            That the inhabitants of Bessa, after they had slaughtered <lb/>
            the officer and soldiers of the Great King, saw plainly that <lb/>
            there was no room for excuse or pardon; that Oroondates, <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            as soon as the intelligence reached Memphis, would im­ <lb/>
            mediately set out with his army,* surround, besiege, and <lb/>
            utterly destroy their town; that therefore they had resolved <lb/>
            to follow up one bold deed by a bolder; to anticipate the <lb/>
            preparations of the Viceroy; to march, in short, without <lb/>
            delay to Memphis, where, if they could arrive unexpectedly, <lb/>
            they might possibly surprise and seize his person, if he <lb/>
            were in the city; or if he were gone, as was reported, upon <lb/>
            nn expedition into Ethiopia, they might more easily make <lb/>
            themselves masters of a place which was drained of its <lb/>
            troops, and so might for some time ward off their danger; <lb/>
            and could also reinstate their captain, Thyamis, in the <lb/>
            priesthood, of which he had been unjustly deprived by his <lb/>
            younger brother. But if they should fail in the bold <lb/>
            attempt, they would have the advantage of dying in the <lb/>
            field, like men, and escape falling into the hands of the <lb/>
            Persians, and being exposed to their insults and tortures. <lb/>
            " But, as for you," continued the old woman, "where are <lb/>
            you going ?”—“ Into the town," said Calasiris.—“It is <lb/>
            not safe for you," returned she, "at this late hour, and <lb/>
            unknown as you are, to go among strangers.”—“ But if <lb/>
            you will receive us into your house," replied the other, <lb/>
            “ we shall think ourselves safe.”—“ I cannot receive you <lb/>
            just at this time,” said she, " for I must now perform some <lb/>
            nocturnal sacrifices. But if you can endure it-and indeed <lb/>
            you must do so, retire to some distance from the slain, and <lb/>
            endeavour to pass the night as well as you can in the plain; <lb/>
            in the morning I will gladly receive and entertain vou as <lb/>
            my guests." When she had said this, Calasiris took Cha­ <lb/>
            rielea, and shortly explained to her what had passed between <lb/>
            them ; and going to a rising ground, not very far from the <lb/>
            field of battle, ho there reclined himself, putting the quiver <lb/>
            under his head.</p>
          <p>Chariclea sat down on her wallet-the moon just rising, <lb/>
            and beginning to illuminate all around with her silver light; <lb/>
            for it was the third day from the full. Calasiris, old, and <lb/>
            fatigued with his journey, dropped asleep; but Chariclea'a <lb/>
            cares kept her waking, and made her spectatress of an <lb/>
            impious and accursed scene, but not an unusual one, among <note type="footnote"> </note><note type="footnote">* ∑<foreign xml:lang="grc">αγηνεύσοντας τὴν κώμην</foreign>. See Book L </note> <note type="footnote">&amp;</note> <lb/>

            the Egyptians. For. now the old woman, supposing herself <lb/>
            at liberty, and unobserved, dug a sort of pit, and lighted a <lb/>
            fire of sticks which she had collected together, on each side <lb/>
            of it. Between the two fires she placed the dead body of <lb/>
            her son, and taking an earthen cup from a neighbouring <lb/>
            tripod, she poured first honey into the trench, then milk, <lb/>
            and then wine. She next worked up a kind of paste of <lb/>
            dough into something of the similitude of a man, and <lb/>
            crowning it with laurel and fennel, cast that too into the <lb/>
            ditch. Then snatching up a sword, with many frantic <lb/>
            gestures and barbarous invocations to the moon, in an <lb/>
            unknown tongue, sho wounded herself in the arm, and <lb/>
            dipping a branch of laurel in her blood, sprinkled it over <lb/>
            the fire. And after many other wild and mystic ceremonies, <lb/>
            she stooped down at length to the corpse of her son, <lb/>
            whispered something in its ear. and, by the power of her <lb/>
            spells, raised and forced it to stand upright.</p>
          <p>Chariclea, who had observed the former part of this <lb/>
            ceremony, not without apprehension, was now seized with <lb/>
            affright and horror, and awakened Calasiris, that ho too <lb/>
            might be a spectator of what was being done. They, being <lb/>
            themselves shrouded in darkness, observed in security <lb/>
            what passed by the light of the fires, and were near enough <lb/>
            too to hear what was said; the old woman now questioning <lb/>
            the dead body in a loud voice,—“ Whether its brother, her <lb/>
            son, would return in safety?”—it answered nothing; but <lb/>
            nodding its head by a doubtful signal, gave its mother room <lb/>
            to hope, and then, on a sudden, fell down again upon its <lb/>
            face. She turned the body on its back, repeated her <lb/>
            question, and whispered, as it should seem, still stronger <lb/>
            charms in its car ; and brandishing her sword now over the <lb/>
            fire, and now over the trench, raised the corpse again, and <lb/>
            putting the same interrogation to it, urged it to answer her, <lb/>
            not by nods and signs only, but in actual and distinct words.</p>
          <p>Here Chariclea addressed Calasiris, and besought him to <lb/>
            approach, and ask something about Theagenes ; but ho <lb/>
            refused altogether; declaring, that it was much against his <lb/>
            inclination that he became a compulsory spectator of so <note type="footnote">* See Lucan, Book vi., 667—761, where Erichtho brings the dead <lb/>
            to life in order to obtain a response as to the future success of <lb/>

            impious a scene; for it did not become a priest to be <lb/>
            present at, much less to take a part in, such a deed.—“ Our <lb/>
            divinations," said he, “are made by means of lawful sacri­ <lb/>
            fices, and pure prayers; not by profane ceremonies, and <lb/>
            unhallowed conjurations of dead carcases, such as our <lb/>
            wayward fate has now obliged us to be witnesses of." But <lb/>
            while he was proceeding, the body, with a deep and hollow <lb/>
            voice, began to speak, as if its words were uttered from the <lb/>
            inmost recesses of a winding cave. " I spared you at first, <lb/>
            0 mother, although you were transgressing the laws of <lb/>
            nature, disregarding the decrees of the fates, and disturbing <lb/>
            by your enchantments, what ought to remain at rest. <lb/>
            There is, even among the departed, a reverence for parents; <lb/>
            but since, as far as in you lies, you destroy that reverence, <lb/>
            and persist in pushing your wicked incantations to the <lb/>
            utmost—since you are not content with raising up a dead <lb/>
            body, and forcing it to make signs, but will proceed to <lb/>
            compel it to speak; regardless of the care you owe to your <lb/>
            son's remains, preventing his shade from mixing with those <lb/>
            who arc gone before him, and mindful only of your own <lb/>
            private convenience and curiosity—hear what I piously <lb/>
            avoided disclosing to you before:</p>
          <p>" Your son shall return no more; and you yourself shall <lb/>
            perish by the sword, and shortly conclude your course by a <lb/>
            violent death, worthy of the execrable practices in which <lb/>
            you have spent your life; you who are not now alone, as <lb/>
            you suppo3e yourself; but are performing your horrid rites, <lb/>
            worthy of being buried in tho deepest silence and darkness, <lb/>
            in the sight of others, and betraying the secrets of the <lb/>
            dead in the hearing of witnesses. One of them is a priest; <lb/>
            and his wisdom indeed is such, that he may perhaps see <lb/>
            the propriety of concealing what he has seen. He is dear <lb/>
            to the gods; and if he hastens his journey, ho may prevent <lb/>
            his sons from engaging singly with each other in a bloody <lb/>
            and deadly fight, and compose their differences. But what <lb/>
            is infinitely worse, a maiden has heard and seen everything <lb/>
            which has taken place. She is deeply in love, and is wsn­ <lb/>
            dering through the world in search of her lover, whom, <lb/>
            after many toils and dangers, she shall at last obtain, and, <lb/>
            in a remote corner of tho earth, pass with him a splendid <lb/>
            and royal life.” <note type="footnote"> L a </note> <pb n="148"/>
            </p>
          <p>Having said this, the body fell again prone on the ground. <lb/>
            The old woman concluding that the strangers were the <lb/>
            spectators meant, ran furiously, in all the disorder of her <lb/>
            dress, and sword in hand, to seek for them among the <lb/>
            dead, where she imagined they had concealed themselves; <lb/>
            determined to destroy, if she could find them, the witnesses <lb/>
            of her abominable incantations. But while searching incau­ <lb/>
            tiously among the carcases, and blinded by her fury, she <lb/>
            stumbled, and fell headlong upon a fragment of a spear <lb/>
            stuck upright in the earth, which, piercing through her <lb/>
            body, soon put an end to her wicked life, and quickly <lb/>
            fulfilled the fatal prophecy of her son.</p>

          <p>ON the other hand, Calasiris and his fair companion, <lb/>
            having been in such danger, in order to be free from their <lb/>
            present terrors, and hastening, on account of the prophecy <lb/>
            they had heard, continued, with diligence, their journey to <lb/>
            Memphis. They arrived at the city at the very time when <lb/>
            those events were being fulfilled which had been foretold <lb/>
            in the incantation scene.* The citizens of Memphis had <lb/>
            just time to shut their gates, before the arrival of Thyamis <lb/>
            and his robber band ; a soldier from the army of Mithranes, <lb/>
            who had escaped from the battle of Bessa having forescen, <lb/>
            and foretold, the attempt.</p>
          <p>Thyamis having ordered his men to encamp under the <lb/>
            walls, rested them after the fatigues of their march ; and <lb/>
            determined forthwith to besiege the city. They in the <lb/>
            town who, surprised at first, expected the attack of a nume­ <lb/>
            rous army, when they saw from their walls the small num­ <lb/>
            her of their assailants, put themselves in motion, and <lb/>
            collecting the few troops, archers and cavalry, left for the <lb/>
            defence of the place, and arming the citizens as best they <lb/>
            could, were preparing to issue out of the gates, and <lb/>
            attack their enemy in the field. But they were restrained by <lb/>
            a man of some years and authority among them, who said, <lb/>
            that although the Viceroy Oroondates was absent in the <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">έκ τῆς νεκυίας</foreign>.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">Νεκυίας</foreign>—the title of the 11th Bk. of the Odyssey. </note> <lb/>

            Æthiopian war, it would be improper for them to take any <lb/>
            step without the knowledge and direction of his wife, <lb/>
            Arsace ; and that the soldiers who were left, would engage <lb/>
            much more heartily in the cause, if fighting under her orders.</p>
          <p>The multitude joined with him iu opinion, and followed <lb/>
            him to the palace which the viceroy inhabited in the absence <lb/>
            of the sovereign. Arsace. was beautiful, And tall; expert <lb/>
            in business; haughty because of her birth, as being the <lb/>
            sister of the Great King; extremely blameable, however, in <lb/>
            her conduct, and given up to dissolute pleasure. She had, <lb/>
            in a great measure, been the cause of the exile of Thyamis: <lb/>
            for when Calasiris, on account of the oracle which lie had <lb/>
            received relative to his children, had withdrawn himself pri­ <lb/>
            vately from Memphis,† and on his disappearing, was thought <lb/>
            to have perished ; Thyamis, as his eldest son, was called to <lb/>
            the dignity of the priesthood, and performed his initiatory <lb/>
            sacrifice in public. Arsace, as she entered the temple of <lb/>
            Isis, encountered this blooming and graceful youth, dressed <lb/>
            on the occasion with more than usual splendour. She cast <lb/>
            wanton glances at him, and by her gestures gave plain inti­ <lb/>
            mation of her passion.‡ He, naturally modest, and virtuously <lb/>
            brought up, did not notice this, and had no suspicion of her <lb/>
            meaning, Hay, intent oil the duties of his office, probably <lb/>
            attributed her conduct to some quite different cause. But <lb/>
            his brother Petosiris, who had viewed with jealous eyes his <lb/>
            exaltation to the priesthood, and had observed the behaviour <lb/>
            of Arsace towards him, considered how he might make use <lb/>
            of her irregular desires, as a means of laying a snare for him <lb/>
            whom he envied.</p>
          <p>lie went privately to Oroondates, discovered to him his <lb/>
            wife's inclinations, and basely and falsely affirmed that <lb/>
            Thyamis complied with them. Oroondates was easily per­ <lb/>
            suaded of the truth of this intelligence, from his previous <lb/>
            suspicions ; but took no notice of it to her, being unable <note type="footnote"> * The description of "Gulbeynz," in Don Juan, canto v., here and <lb/>

            clearly to convict her; and dreading and respecting the <lb/>
            royal race she sprang from, thought it best to conceal his real <lb/>
            opinion. He did not, however, cease uttering threats of <lb/>
            death against Thyamis, until he drove him into banishment ; <lb/>
            when Petosiris was appointed to the priesthood in his room.</p>
          <p>These events happened some years before the time of <lb/>
            which I am at present speaking. But now the multitude <lb/>
            surrounded the palace of Arsace, informed her of the ap­ <lb/>
            proach of an hostile army (of which however she was aware) <lb/>
            and besought her to give orders to the soldiers to march <lb/>
            out with them to attack the enemy.</p>
          <p>She told them that she thought sibe ought not to comply <lb/>
            with their request, till the had made herself a little ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with the number of the enemy—who they were— <lb/>
            from whence they came—and what was the cause of their <lb/>
            expedition. That for that purpose she thought it would <lb/>
            be proper for her first to ascend the walls, to take a survey <lb/>
            from thence ; and then having collected more troops, to <lb/>
            determine, upon consideration, what was possible and expe­ <lb/>
            dient to be done.</p>
          <p>The people acquiesced in what sie said, and advanced at <lb/>
            once towards the wall ; where, by her command, they <lb/>
            erected upon the ramparts a tent, adorned with purple and <lb/>
            gold-embroidered tapestry; and she, royally attired, placed <lb/>
            herself under it, on a lofty throne, having around her, her <lb/>
            guards in arms, glittering with gold; and holding up a <lb/>
            herald's wand,* the symbol of peace, invited the chiefs of <lb/>
            the enemy to a conference under the walls.</p>
          <p>Thyamis and Theagenes advanced before the rest, and <lb/>
            presented themselves under the ramparts, in complete <lb/>
            armour, their heads only uncovered: and the herald made <lb/>
            proclamation :—</p>
          <p>“Arsace, wife of the chief viceroy, and sister of the Great <lb/>
            King, desires to know who you are — what arc your demands <lb/>
            -and why you presume to make incursions into the terri­ <lb/>
            tory of Memphis ?”—They replied, that their followers were <lb/>
            men of Bessa.—Thyamis, moreover, explained who he was : <lb/>
            how being unjustly deprived of the priesthood of Memphis <lb/>
            by the suspicions of Oroondates, and the arts of his brother <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κηρὐκειον</foreign>, caduceus, the staff or mace carried by heralds and <lb/>

            Petosiris, he was come to claim it again at the head of these <lb/>
            bands-tbat if they would restore him to his office, be asked <lb/>
            no more; and his followers would withdraw in peace, with­ <lb/>
            out injuring any one; but if they refused this just demand, <lb/>
            he must endeavour to do himself justice by force and arms­ <lb/>
            that it became Arsace to revenge herself upon Petosiris for <lb/>
            his wicked calumnies against her; by which he had infused <lb/>
            into the mind of her husband suspicions against her honour; <lb/>
            and had driven him, his brother, into exile."</p>
          <p>These words made a great impression upon the citizens: <lb/>
            they well recollected Thyamis again ; and now knowing the <lb/>
            cause of his unexpected flight, of which they were ignorant <lb/>
            before, they were very much disposed to believe that what <lb/>
            he now alleged was truth. But Arsace was more disturbed <lb/>
            than any one, and distracted by a tempest of different cares <lb/>
            and thoughts. She was inflamed with anger against Peto­ <lb/>
            siris, and calling to mind the past, resolved how she might <lb/>
            best revenge herself upon him. She looked sometimes at <lb/>
            Thyamis, and then again at Theagenes: and was alternately <lb/>
            drawn by her desires towards both. Her old inclination to <lb/>
            the former revived; towards the latter a new and stronger <lb/>
            flame hurried her away: so that her emotion was very visible <lb/>
            to all the by-standers. After some struggle, however, re­ <lb/>
            covering herself, as if from convulsive seizure, she said, “ What <lb/>
            madness has engaged the inhabitants of Bessain this expe­ <lb/>
            dition ? and you, beautiful and graceful youths of noble birth, <lb/>
            why should you expose yourselves to manifest destruction <lb/>
            for a band of marauders, who, if they were to come to a <lb/>
            battle, would not be able to sustain the first shock ? for the <lb/>
            troops of the Great King are not so reduced as not to have <lb/>
            left a sufficient force in the city to surround and overwhelur <lb/>
            all of you, although the viceroy be absent in a foreign war. <lb/>
            But since the pretext of this expedition is of a private <lb/>
            nature, why should the people at largo be sufferers in a, <lb/>
            quarrel in which they have no concern ? Rather let the <lb/>
            parties determine their dispute between themselves, and <lb/>
            commit their cause to the justice and judgment of the gods. <lb/>
            Let, then, the inhabitants both of Memphis and the men of <lb/>
            Bessa remain at peace; nor causelessly wage war against <lb/>
            each other. Let those who contend for the priesthood en­ <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            gage in single combat, and be the holy dignity the prize of <lb/>
            the conqueror."</p>
          <p>Arsace was beard by the inhabitants of Memphis with <lb/>
            pleasure, and her proposal was received with their unani­ <lb/>
            mous applause. They suspected the wickedness and trea­ <lb/>
            chery of Petosiris, and were pleased with the prospect of <lb/>
            transferring to his single person the sudden danger which <lb/>
            threatened the whole community. But the bands of Bessa <lb/>
            did not so readily agree; they were at first very averse to <lb/>
            expose their leader to peril in their behalf, until Thyamis at <lb/>
            length persuaded them to consent; representing to them <lb/>
            the weakness and unskilfulness of Petosoris, whereas he <lb/>
            should engage in the combat with every possible advantage <lb/>
            on his side. This reflection probably influenced Arsace in <lb/>
            proposing the single combat. She hoped to obtain by it <lb/>
            her real aim, revenge upon Petosiris, exposing him to light <lb/>
            with one so much his superior in skill and courage.</p>
          <p>The preparations for the encounter were now made with <lb/>
            all celerity; Thyamis, with the utmost alacrity, hastening to <lb/>
            put on what still he wanted to complete his armour. Then. <lb/>
            genes encouraging him, securely buckled on his arms, and <lb/>
            placed, lastly, a helmet on his head, flashing with gold, and <lb/>
            with a lofty crest.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Petosiris protested against the combat. <lb/>
            He was obliged by violence to put on his arms ; and, by the <lb/>
            command of Arsace, was thrust out of the gates. Thyinis <lb/>
            seeing him—" Do you observe, Theagenes," said he, " how <lb/>
            Petosiris shakes with fear?"—“ Yes," replied the other; <lb/>
            “but how (resumed he) will you use the victory which <lb/>
            seems ready to your hands ; for it is no common foe whom <lb/>
            you are going to encounter, but a brother ?"—" You say <lb/>
            well;" he returned, " and have touched the very subject of <lb/>
            my thoughts. I intend to conquer him with the assistance <lb/>
            of the gods, but not to kill him. Far be it from me to suffer <lb/>
            myself to be so far transported by anger, resentment, or <lb/>
            ambition, as to pursue revenge for past injuries, or purchase <lb/>
            future honours at the expense of a brother's blood! "</p>
          <p>" You speak nobly," said Theagenes; " and as one who <lb/>
            feels the force of natural ties; but have ou any commands <lb/>
            for me ?"—" The combat I am going to engage in," said <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            Thyamis, “ is a mere trifle, fit to be despised; but since For­ <lb/>
            tune sometimes sports with mortals, and strange accidents <lb/>
            happen, I will just say, that if I prove victor, on shall <lb/>
            accompany me into the city, live with me, and partake <lb/>
            equally with myself, of everything which my fortune and <lb/>
            station can afford. But if, contrary to my expectation, If <lb/>
            should be vanquished, you shall command the bands of <lb/>
            Bessa, with whom you are in great favour, and shall lead for a <lb/>
            time the life of a freebooter, till the Deity shall place you <lb/>
            in more prosperous circumstances." Having said this, they <lb/>
            embraced each other with great affection; and Theagenes <lb/>
            sat down to observe the issue of the fight.</p>
          <p>In this situation he unconsciously afforded Arsace an <lb/>
            opportunity of feeding herself upon his presence, as she sur­ <lb/>
            veyed his person, and gratified at least her eyes.. And <lb/>
            now Thvamis advanced towards Petosiris; but Petosiris <lb/>
            could not sustain his approach, and on his first movement <lb/>
            turned about towards the gate, and attempted to re-enter <lb/>
            the city, but in vain; for those who were stationed at the <lb/>
            entrance drove him back ; and those who were upon the <lb/>
            walls gave notice throughout the whole circuit of the place, <lb/>
            that he should nowhere be admitted. He fled then as fast <lb/>
            as he could around the city, and at length threw away his <lb/>
            arms. Thyamis pursued him; and Theagenes followed, <lb/>
            solicitous for his friend, and desirous of seeing what would <lb/>
            happen. He took no arms with him, lest it might appear <lb/>
            that he came to assist Thyamis ; but, placing his spear and <lb/>
            shield where he had before sat, and leaving them for Arsace <lb/>
            to contemplate in his stead, he attended closely on the steps <lb/>
            of the brothers.</p>
          <p>Petosiris was not yet taken, nor was he far in advance ; <lb/>
            he was every minute in danger of being reached, and had <lb/>
            only so much the advantage of the course, as it was reason­ <lb/>
            able to suppose an unarmed man would have over one who <lb/>
            was in armour. In this manner they twice circled the <lb/>
            walls ; but the third time Thyamis approached near enough <lb/>
            to threaten the back of his brother with his spear. He <lb/>
            called on him to stop and turn, if he would avoid receiving <note type="footnote"> * " She did so course o'er my exteriors with such a greedy intention <lb/>

            a wound; the multitude meanwhile upon the walls, as in a <lb/>
            theatre, being spectators and judges of the contest.</p>
          <p>Just at this instant, either the interposition of the Deity, <lb/>
            or the caprice of Fortune, who rules the affairs of men, in­ <lb/>
            troduced an episode upon the stage, and supplied, as if out <lb/>
            of rivalry, a beginning for another drama. Calasiris, who <lb/>
            had submitted to a voluntary exile, and had supported in­ <lb/>
            numerable perils, both by sea and land, in order to avoid <lb/>
            the dreadful sight, was brought to the spot at that very <lb/>
            hour, and compelled by inevitable fate to become a witness <lb/>
            of the encounter of his sons, as the oracle had long ago fore­ <lb/>
            told he should be. As soon as he arrived near enough to <lb/>
            see what was passing under the walls of Memphis—when <lb/>
            he recognised his children, recollected the prophecy, and <lb/>
            saw the arms of one of them raised against the other, he <lb/>
            hastened with greater speed than his age seemed to admit <lb/>
            of, (doing violence to his weight of years), to prevent the <lb/>
            dreaded issue of the combat.</p>
          <p>Having nearly reached them, he exclaimed with all his <lb/>
            might-“ My children ! what mean you ? what madness is <lb/>
            this!" They, intent on what they were themselves en­ <lb/>
            gaged in, did not recognise their father, covered as he was <lb/>
            with beggars weeds, but took him for some wandering <lb/>
            vagrant, who was probably beside himself. Those who were <lb/>
            on the walls, wondered at his so rashly exposing himself <lb/>
            between the combatants. Others laughed at what they <lb/>
            thought his mad and fruitless efforts. When the good old <lb/>
            man perceived that he was not known under these mean <lb/>
            garments, he cast aside the tatters under which he was dis­ <lb/>
            guised ; let his sacred locks flow down upon his shoulders, <lb/>
            threw away his scrip and staff, and stood before them with <lb/>
            a reverend and priest-like aspect; gently inclining his body, <lb/>
            and stretching out his hands as a suppliant: his tears flowed <lb/>
            apace, while lie exclaimed-" 0 my sons, I am Calasiris—1 <lb/>
            am your father-stay your hands—repress your fatal rage— <lb/>
            receive, acknowledge, and reverence your parent."</p>
          <p>Almost ready to swoon, the young men slackened in their <lb/>
            course, and cast themselves before his feet, hardly believing <lb/>
            what they saw; but when they were convinced that it was <lb/>
            really Calasiris, and no phantom, they embraced his knees, <lb/>
            and clung to him, their minds labouring with various and <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            conflicting feelings. They were rejoiced at seeing their <lb/>
            father unexpectedly safe-they were ashamed and hurt at <lb/>
            the circumstances in which lie had found them-they were <lb/>
            confused and solicitous at the uncertainty of what was to <lb/>
            follow.</p>
          <p>The spectators from the city gazed with wonder at what <lb/>
            was passing, and observed it in silence, without interfering. <lb/>
            They were, in a manner, astounded with ignorance and stir­ <lb/>
            prise, and stood like figures on a painter's canvas, rivetted <lb/>
            upon the scene before them, when lo! a new actress made <lb/>
            her appearance on the stage. Chariclea followed close after <lb/>
            Calasiris. The eye of a lover is quick as lightning in recog­ <lb/>
            nising the object of its passion—a single gesture, the fold of <lb/>
            a garment, seen behind, or at a distance, is sufficient to con­ <lb/>
            firm its conjectures. When she knew Theagenes afar off, <lb/>
            transported at the long-wished-for sight, she ran frantickly <lb/>
            towards him, and, falling on his neck, embraced hint closely, <lb/>
            breathing out her passion in inarticulate murmurs.</p>
          <p>He, when he saw a squalid face, disguised, and industri­ <lb/>
            ously discoloured, her tattered garments, and vile appear­ <lb/>
            ance, repulsed and threw her from him with disgust, as <lb/>
            some common beggar; and when she still persisted, and <lb/>
            hindered his seeing Calasiris and his children, he smote her <lb/>
            on the face. She softly said to him—“O Pythias, have you <lb/>
            then forgotten the torch ? " He, startled as at the sudden <lb/>
            stroke of an arrow, recognized the token which bad been <lb/>
            agreed upon between them ; and, looking at the countenance <lb/>
            of Chariclea, which broke on him like the sun from behind <lb/>
            a cloud, rushed into her embrace. All those upon the walls, <lb/>
            including Arsace herself, who swelled with displeasure and <lb/>
            already viewed Chariclea with jealous eyes, were overcome <lb/>
            with wonder, as at some scenic exhibition.</p>
          <p>The unnatural warfare between the brothers was now <lb/>
            ended; the tragedy which threatened blood, had passed into <lb/>
            a comedy. The father, who had seen them armed against <lb/>
            each other, and had nearly been a spectator of the wounds <lb/>
            of one of them, became the instrument of peace.* He who <lb/>
            was unable to avoid the fated spectacle of his sons' hos­ <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Είρήνης αύτὸς ἐγένετο πρύτανις</foreign>—literally, he became the pre­ <lb/>
            sident or manager, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            tilities, was fortunate enough to rule the issue of what fate <lb/>
            had ordered.</p>
          <p>They recovered their father after a ten years' exile; and <lb/>
            they hastened to crown and invest hint again with the en­ <lb/>
            signs of that dignity, which had nearly been the cause of a <lb/>
            bloody contest between them. But amid all these successes <lb/>
            the love scene of the drama triumphed—Theagenes and <lb/>
            Chariclea, blooming in youth and beauty, and sparkling with <lb/>
            pleasure at having recovered one another, attracted the eyes <lb/>
            of every beholder. Nearly the whole city poured out through <lb/>
            the gates, and a multitude of every age and sex hurried into <lb/>
            the plain. The young men surrounded Theagenes ; those in <lb/>
            the prime of life, and who had formerly known him, crowded <lb/>
            round Thyamis; the maidens who already indulged in <lb/>
            dreams of wedlock followed Chariclea ; the old men and <lb/>
            priests attended upon and congratuled Calasiris:—thus a <lb/>
            kind of sacred procession was formed upon the instant.</p>
          <p>Thyamis dismissed the men of Bessa with much grati­ <lb/>
            tude, and many thanks for their ready assistance, lie pro­ <lb/>
            mised by the next full moon to send them a hundred oxen, <lb/>
            a thousand sheep, and ten drachmas each ; and then, placing <lb/>
            his neck within the embrace of the old man, he supported <lb/>
            on one side the tottering steps of his weary father, whom <lb/>
            fatigue, surprise, and joy had well nigh exhausted. Peto­ <lb/>
            siris on his side did the same: and thus they led him, with <lb/>
            lighted torches, and the applause and congratulations of the <lb/>
            surrounding multitude, to the temple of Isis; pipes and <lb/>
            sacred flutes attending the procession, and stimulating the <lb/>
            spirits of the young to activity in the holy dance. Neither <lb/>
            was Arsace herself absent from the ceremony, for with <lb/>
            guards, attendants, and much pomp, she proceeded to the <lb/>
            temple of Isis, where she offered gold and precious stones, <lb/>
            under pretence of setting an example to the city, but having <lb/>
            eyes for Theagenes alone, and gazing upon him with <lb/>
            more eagerness than did all the others ; yet the pleasure <lb/>
            she received was not unmixed. Theagenes held Chariclea <lb/>
            by the hand, and for her he removed the surrounding crowd, <lb/>
            and the keen stings of jealousy sunk deep into the breast <lb/>
            of Arsace.</p>
          <p>. But Calasiris, when he arrived at the innermost part of <lb/>
            the temple, threw himself on his face, and continued so long <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            prostrate and motionless at the feet of the sacred image, <lb/>
            that he was near expiring under emotion. The bystanders <lb/>
            gently raised and set him on his feet; and when with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty, and by degrees, he came to himself, he poured out a <lb/>
            libation to the goddess, and, in tho midst of vows nnd <lb/>
            prayers, took the sacred diadem of the priesthood from his <lb/>
            own head, nnd placed it on that of his son Thyamis ; saying <lb/>
            to the spectators—“That he felt himself old, and saw his <lb/>
            end approaching—that his eldest son was his lawful suc­ <lb/>
            cessor in the office–and that he possessed the needful <lb/>
            vigour, both of mind and body, for exercising the functions <lb/>
            of it."</p>
          <p>The multitude testified, by their acclamations, their ap­ <lb/>
            probation of what he said; and he retired with his sons, and <lb/>
            Theagenes, to those apartments of the temple which are set <lb/>
            apart for the high-priest. The crowd separated to their <lb/>
            several habitations ; and Arsace at length departed, unwil­ <lb/>
            lingly, and often turning back, under pretence of greater <lb/>
            respect to the goddess; at last, however she did depart, <lb/>
            casting back her eyes as long as possible upon Theagenes.</p>
          <p>As soon as she arrived at her palace, she hurried to her <lb/>
            chamber, and, throwing herself upon the bed, in the habit <lb/>
            she had on, lay there a long time speechless. She was a <lb/>
            woman ever inclined to sensual passion ; and was now in­ <lb/>
            flamed above measure by the beauties and grace of The­ <lb/>
            ogenes, which excelled any she had ever beheld. She con­ <lb/>
            tinued restless and agitated all night, turning from one side <lb/>
            to the other, fetching deep and frequent sighs ; now rising <lb/>
            up, and again falling back on her couch ; now tearing off <lb/>
            her clothes, and then again throwing herself upon her bed; <lb/>
            calling in her maids without cause, and dismissing them <lb/>
            without orders.. In short, her unrestrained love would <lb/>
            certainlv have driven her into frenzy, had not an old crone. <note type="footnote"> * ., Her rage was but a minute's, and 'twas well— <lb/>
            A moment's more had slain her; hut the while <lb/>

            Though horrible to see, yet grand to tell, <lb/>

            Cybele by name, her bedchamber woman, well acquainted <lb/>
            with her secrets, and who had ministered to her amours, <lb/>
            hurried into the chamber.</p>
          <p>Nothing had escaped her notice, and she now came to add <lb/>
            fuel to the flame; thus addressing her:—“ What ails you, <lb/>
            my dear mistress ? What new passion tortures you ? Whose <lb/>
            countenance has raised such a flamo in my nursling's soul ? <lb/>
            Is there any one foolish or insolent enough to overlook or <lb/>
            contemn advances from you ? Can any mortal see your <lb/>
            charms unmoved, and not esteem your favours as a most <lb/>
            supreme felicity? Conceal nothing from me, my sweet child. <lb/>
            He must be made of adamant, indeed, whom my arts cannot <lb/>
            soften. Only tell me your wishes, and I will answer for the <lb/>
            success of them. You have more than once made trial of <lb/>
            my skill and fidelity." With these and such like insinua­ <lb/>
            ting persuasions, and falling at the feet of Arsace, site en­ <lb/>
            treated her to disclose the cause of her sufferings and agita­ <lb/>
            tions. The princess at last, composing herself a little, said­ <lb/>
            " Good nurse! I have received a deeper wound than I <lb/>
            have ever yet felt; and though I have frequently, on similar <lb/>
            occasions, successfully experienced your abilities, I doubt <lb/>
            whether they can avail me now. The war which threatened <lb/>
            our walls yesterday,. has ended without bloodshed, and has <lb/>
            settled into peace; but it has been the cause of raising a <lb/>
            more cruel war within my bosom, and of inflicting a deep <lb/>
            wound, not on any part of my body, but on my very soul, <lb/>
            by offering to my view, in a luckless hour, that foreign <lb/>
            youth who ran near Thyamis during the single combat. <lb/>
            You must know whom 1 mean, for his beauty shone so <lb/>
            transcendently among them all, as to be conspicuous to the <lb/>
            rudest and most insensible to love, much more to one of <lb/>
            your matured experience. Wherefore my dearest nurse, <lb/>
            now that you know my wound, employ all your skill to heal <lb/>
            it; call up every art, work with every spell and will which <lb/>
            years have taught you, if you would have your mistress sur­ <lb/>
            vive ; for it is in vain for me to think of living, if I do not <lb/>
            enjoy this young man."</p>
          <p>" I believe I know the youth of whom you speak,” replied <note type="footnote"> *The original has <foreign xml:lang="grc">τήμερον</foreign>, to-day; but that must be an oversight, <lb/>

            the old woman; “his chost and shoulders were broad; his <lb/>
            neck, straight and noble; his stature, raised above his fel­ <lb/>
            lows; and he outshone, in short, every one around him <lb/>
            his eyes sparkling with animation, yet their fire tempered <lb/>
            with sweetness; his beautiful locks clustered on his <lb/>
            shoulders; and the first down of youth appeared upon his <lb/>
            check. An outlandish wench, not without beauty, but of un­ <lb/>
            common impudence, ran suddenly up to him, embraced him, <lb/>
            and hung upon his neck.-Is not this the man you mean?”</p>
          <p>“It is indeed," replied Arsace; "I well remember the <lb/>
            last circumstance you mention; and that strolling hussr, <lb/>
            whose* home-spun made-up charms have nothing more In <lb/>
            them than common, but are, alas! much more fortunate <lb/>
            than mine, since they have obtained for her such a lover.</p>
          <p>The old woman smiled at this, and said,–“ Be of good <lb/>
            cheer, my child; the stranger just now, perhaps, thinks his <lb/>
            present mistress handsome; but if I can make him possessor <lb/>
            of your beauties he will find himself to have exchanged brass <lb/>
            for gold,t and will look with disdain upon that conceited <lb/>
            and saucy strumpet.”—“ Only do this, my dearest Cybele, <lb/>
            and you will cure, at once, two dreadful distempers—love <lb/>
            and Jealousy; you will free me from one, and satisfy the <lb/>
            other.”–“ Be it my care," replied the nurse, " to bring this <lb/>
            about; do you, in the mean time, compose yourself; take a <lb/>
            little rest; do not despair before the trial, but cherish <lb/>
            soothing hope." Having said this, she took up the lamp, <lb/>
            and, shutting the door of the chamber, went away.</p>
          <p>Soon after sunrise, taking one of tho eunuchs of the <lb/>
            palace with her, and ordering a maid to follow her with <lb/>
            cakes! and other requisites for sacrifice, she hastened to the <lb/>
            temple of Isis. Upon arriving at the entrance, sho said­ <lb/>
            she came to offer a sacrifice for her mistress Arsace, who <lb/>
            had been disturbed by portentous dreams, and wished to <lb/>
            propitiate the goddess. One of the vergers opposed, <lb/>
            and sent her away, telling her—“ that the temple <lb/>
            was overwhelmed with sorrow-that Calasiris, returned <lb/>
            from his long exile, had feasted with his friend the evening <figure type="illustration">

              before, unbending his mind with unusual cheerfulness and <lb/>
              mirth :-after the entertainment he made a libation, and <lb/>
              poured out many prayers to the goddess-he told his sons <lb/>
              that they would not see him much longer-and earnestly re­ <lb/>
              commended to their protection the young Greeks who came <lb/>
              with him ; begging them to have the tendered care of, and <lb/>
              assist them in everything:—he then retired to rest; and <lb/>
              whether excess of joy had relaxed his nerves and exhausted <lb/>
              his spirits more than his old and worn-out frame could bear, <lb/>
              or whether he had asked, and obtained, this favour of the <lb/>
              gods, towards cock-crowing he was found to have expired, <lb/>
              by his sons, who, alarmed at his presages, had watched over <lb/>
              him all night. And now,” continued he,“ we have sent into <lb/>
              the city, to assemble together the rest of the priestly caste, <lb/>
              that we may celebrate his funeral rites according to the <lb/>
              custom of our country. You must therefore retire; for it <lb/>
              is not lawful for any one, except the priests, to enter the <lb/>
              temple, much less to sacrifice, for at least seven days.”</p>
          <p>" What then will become of the Grecian strangers during <lb/>
            this interval ?" said Cybele ?–“ Thyamis," he replied, <lb/>
            " our new high-priest, has ordered apartments to be fitted <lb/>
            up for them, beyond its precincts; and they are even <lb/>
            now complying with our custom, by quitting the temple, <lb/>
            and during this melancholy space of time, will lodge with­ <lb/>
            out.”</p>
          <p>The old woman, thinking this an admirable occasion to <lb/>
            spread her nets and prepare her snares, said, " Good verger, <lb/>
            now is the time to be of service to the strangers, and to <lb/>
            oblige Arsace, sister of the Great King. You know how <lb/>
            fond she is of Greeks, and. how ready to show hospitality to <lb/>
            foreigners; let these young people know, that with the <lb/>
            knowledge, and by the consent ot Thyamis, apartments are <lb/>
            prepared for them in our palace."</p>
          <p>The verger, suspecting nothing of <unclear>Cybele</unclear>'s designs, ima­ <lb/>
            gined that he was doing a very good office for the strangers <lb/>
            if he could get them received into the Viceroy's palace ; <lb/>
            that he should also oblige those who asked this of him, and <lb/>
            hurt nobody. He sought therefore Theagenes and Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea. He found them drowned in tears, and overwhelmed <lb/>
            with sorrow. " You do not act," said he, " conformably to <lb/>
            the principles of your country or religion in lamenting so <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            deeply the departure of a holy man, who, besides, foretold <lb/>
            it to you, and forbade you to grieve at it. Reason and the <lb/>
            divine word should rather encourage you to attend him, <lb/>
            mentally, with rejoicing and congratulation as resting from <lb/>
            his labours, and having exchanged this troublesome state <lb/>
            for a better. On your own account, however, I can excuse <lb/>
            your giving way, at first, to grief, having lost your lather, <lb/>
            your protector, and chief support; but you must not de­ <lb/>
            spair; Thyamis succeeds not only to his father's dignity, <lb/>
            but to his affections towards you. He has manifested the <lb/>
            greatest regard for you. His first thoughts have been for <lb/>
            your accommodation, He has been able to procure a retreat <lb/>
            for you, so splendid, as not only foreigners in low estate <lb/>
            like you, but the greatest of the inhabitants, would envy <lb/>
            Follow then this woman," pointing to Cybele—“ consider <lb/>
            her as your mother, and accept the hospitality to which she <lb/>
            will introduce you."</p>
          <p>Theagenes and Chariclea did as they were directed. Grief <lb/>
            had so overwhelmed their faculties, that they hardly knew <lb/>
            what they were about; and in their present forlorn state were <lb/>
            willing to fly to any refuge. But could they have foreseen <lb/>
            the calamities which awaited them in the house they were <lb/>
            about to enter, they would have shrunk back. Fortune, <lb/>
            whose sport they were, seemed now to promise them a short <lb/>
            space for rest, and a prospect of joy, only to plunge them <lb/>
            deeper in misfortunes. They went voluntary prisoners; <lb/>
            and young, strangers, and unsuspecting, deceived by the <lb/>
            fair show of hospitality, they delivered themselves up to <lb/>
            their enemy. Thus subject is a wandering life to the cloud <lb/>
            of error, and thus easily is the unhappy traveller deluded <lb/>
            and imposed upon.</p>
          <p>The lovers, when they arrived at the viceregal palace, <lb/>
            and saw its magnificent vestibules (far more splendid than <lb/>
            any private house), the guards, and array of attendants <lb/>
            and courtiers, were surprised and disturbed, observing the <lb/>
            habitation to be very much beyond what was suitable to the <lb/>
            present condition of their fortunes. However, they fol­ <lb/>
            lowed Cybele, who exhorted and encouraged them—called <lb/>
            them her friends and children, and bid them form the most <lb/>
            pleasing expectations for their future. At length, when <lb/>
            she had brought them to her own apartment, which was <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            remote and private, she caused them to Bit down, and thus <lb/>
            addressed them:</p>
          <p>" My children, I am acquainted with the cause of your <lb/>
            present sorrow; and that you lament, with great reason, <lb/>
            the death of the high priest, Calasiris, who was in the place <lb/>
            of a father to you; but it is proper for you now to tell me <lb/>
            who you are, and from whence you come. So far I know, <lb/>
            that you are Greeks; and, as I judge from your appearance, <lb/>
            of a good family ; for a countenance so ingenuous, so graceful <lb/>
            and engaging an air, bespeak a noble race. But from what <lb/>
            country and city of Greece you come, and by what chance <lb/>
            you have wandered hither, I wish to know; and it will be for <lb/>
            your interest to acquaint me, that I may inform my mistress <lb/>
            Arsace, the sister of the Great King, and wife of the most <lb/>
            powerful of the viceroys, Oroondates. She is hospitable, <lb/>
            refined, and a lover of the Greeks. When she has had <lb/>
            some previous information about you, you will appear before <lb/>
            her with less embarrassment, and more honour. And what­ <lb/>
            ever you disclose, will not be to an entire stranger, for I also <lb/>
            am a Greek by nation. I am a native of Lesbos. I was <lb/>
            brought here a captive; but I find my life in captivity plea­ <lb/>
            santer than any I could have hoped to pass at home, for <lb/>
            I enjoy the entire confidence of my mistress; she sees only <lb/>
            with my eyes, and hears with my ears; but I make use of <lb/>
            the credit I have with her to introduce only worthy and <lb/>
            honourable persons to her acquaintance."</p>
          <p>Theagenes, comparing in her mind what Cybele now said, <lb/>
            with the behaviour of Arsace the day before; recollecting <lb/>
            how intently she had fixed her eyes upon him, and calling <lb/>
            to memory her wanton signs and glances,. foreboded no <lb/>
            good to himself from what was to follow: he prepared, <lb/>
            however, to say something in answer to Cybele, when <lb/>
            Chariclea whispered in his ear—“Remember that I am <lb/>
            your sister in what you are going to say." He, taking the <lb/>
            hint, began— <lb/>
            “ You know already, Mother! that we are Greeks-this <note type="footnote"> * –it Fie-fie upon her ! <lb/>
            There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip; <lb/>
            Nay, her foot speaks ; her wanton spirits look out <lb/>
            At nvery joint and motive of her body." <lb/>

            young woman is my sister-our parents were carried off by <lb/>
            pirates—we set out in search of them, and ourselves met <lb/>
            with worse fortunes, falling into the hands of cruel men, <lb/>
            who robbed us of our all, which was considerable, and were, <lb/>
            with difficulty, persuaded to spare our lives. Some pitying <lb/>
            deity brought us acquainted with the hero Calasiris (now <lb/>
            beatified): under his guidance we arrived here, flattering <lb/>
            ourselves that we should spend the remainder of our lives <lb/>
            under his protection; but now we are as you see, left alone, <lb/>
            and desolate; bereft of our own parents, and of him who <lb/>
            promised to supply the place of them. This is our present <lb/>
            situation. To you we return our best thanks for your good <lb/>
            offices and hospitality; and you would greatly enhance the <lb/>
            favour by suffering us to live retired, and by ourselves ; <lb/>
            deferring, for some time at least, the favour you hinted at, <lb/>
            that of introducing us to Arsace. Strangers, wanderers, <lb/>
            and unfortunate as we are, we are very unfit to appear in <lb/>
            her splendid court. Acquaintance and intercourse are best <lb/>
            suited for those who are of equal rank." Cybele could hardly <lb/>
            restrain herself at this intelligence. She betrayed, by her <lb/>
            countenance, evident marks of the joy she felt at hearing <lb/>
            that Chariclea was the sister of Theagenes, concluding that <lb/>
            she would now be no obstacle to the amorous designs of her <lb/>
            mistress.</p>
          <p>" Fair youth," said she, " you will have different sen­ <lb/>
            timents of Arsace when you are acquainted with her. She <lb/>
            condescends, and accommodates herself to every kind of <lb/>
            fortune. She has a particular pleasure in comforting and <lb/>
            assisting those who have met with unworthy treatment. <lb/>
            Though she is by birth a Persian, in disposition she is a <lb/>
            Greek. She delights in the company and conversation of <lb/>
            those who, like yourselves, are lately come from Greece. <lb/>
            Sho greatly affects both the Grecian ways and manners: <lb/>
            be of good cheer then; you will not fail to receive every <lb/>
            attention and honour which a man can wish for, and your <lb/>
            sister will be her companion and favourite. But now tell <lb/>
            me your names? Having heard them, she ran to Arsace, <lb/>
            ordering them to wait her return, and giving directions to her <lb/>
            portress (an old woman like herself,) not to suffer any one <lb/>
            to enter the apartment, nor to permit those who were inside <lb/>
            to leave it. <note type="footnote"> M2 </note> <pb n="164"/>
            </p>
          <p>" But," said the other,“ what if your son Achæmenes <lb/>
            should return; he went out just before your departure to <lb/>
            the temple, in order to get some application to his eyes, <lb/>
            which are still very troublesome to hun “ Neither must <lb/>
            he enter," replied she; " make fast the doors, and tell <lb/>
            him that I am gone away, and have taken the key with <lb/>
            me.“</p>
          <p>The portress did as she was directed; and Cybele was <lb/>
            no sooner departed than the unhappy lovers could no longer <lb/>
            restrain their bitter thoughts and lamentations. Almost in <lb/>
            the same instant he cried out " 0 Chariclea!"—She, it 0 <lb/>
            Theagenes!" They proceeded to deplore their misfortunes <lb/>
            in the same frame of mind and nearly in the same words. <lb/>
            They mingled embraces with their complaints, and kisses <lb/>
            with their tears. The remembrance of Calasiris drove them <lb/>
            at last into audible grief; into cries and sobs; Chariclea <lb/>
            particularly, who had known him longer—who had expe­ <lb/>
            rienced more of his attention, benevolence, and affection. <lb/>
            " 0 Calasiris !" she cried out, as well as her sobs would let <lb/>
            her, “ for I can no longer call you by the sweet name of <lb/>
            father; the evil genius who persecutes me, has on all sides <lb/>
            deprived me of that endearing appellation. My real father <lb/>
            I have never known. I betrayed, alas! and deserted <lb/>
            him who adopted me;* and have lost him who received, <lb/>
            preserved, comforted, and instructed me; and the cus­ <lb/>
            torn of the priests does not permit me to pay the last <lb/>
            tribute of tears over his dear remains. Yet, 0 my pre­ <lb/>
            server (and I will once more call you father), here at least, <lb/>
            while I may, I will pour out a libation to you with my tears, <lb/>
            and give you offerings from my hair. So saying, she <lb/>
            plucked handfuls from her beauteous tresses. Theagenes <lb/>
            caught her hands, and besought her to forbear.</p>
          <p>She, however proceeded in tragic strain †—“ Why do I <lb/>
            continue to live, deprived of such a hope ? Calasiris is <lb/>
            gone!—the support of my wanderings—my leader in a <lb/>
            foreign country, and only guide to my native one—he who <lb/>
            :.une could lead me to the knowledge of my parents—our <lb/>
            comfort in adversity, our defender from misfortune, our <lb/>
            strength, and stay, is lost; and has left us, a miserable pair, <lb/>
            ignorant and forlorn, in a foreign land. , For want of <note type="footnote"> * Chariclea. </note> <note type="footnote"> t <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηδε επίτραγῶδει</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            guidance, it is impossible for us to continue our journey. <lb/>
            That grave, bland, wise, and of a truth, hoary, * soul <lb/>
            is fled, and will not see the event of its labours on our <lb/>
            behalf. ”</p>
          <p>While she was going on thus dolefully, and Theagenes, <lb/>
            though be felt deeply for himself, was attempting to com­ <lb/>
            pose her, and to repress the violent expressions of her grief, <lb/>
            Achæmenes returned; and finding the doors fast, inquired <lb/>
            of the old portress the reason. She told him, that it was <lb/>
            by his mother's order. While he was wondering what <lb/>
            could be her motive, he heard Chariclea lamenting within; <lb/>
            and stooping down, and looking through the crevices of the <lb/>
            door, he could easily see what passed in the chamber. <lb/>
            Again he asked the old woman who those were whom he <lb/>
            saw within. She told him—“ She knew no more of them, <lb/>
            than that they were a youth and maiden, foreigners, as the <lb/>
            guessed, whom Cybele had not long before brought with her."</p>
          <p>Again be stooped down, and took a more careful survey <lb/>
            of them. Chariclea was entirely unknown to him. Yet he <lb/>
            admired her beauty, and figured to himself what it must be <lb/>
            when not obscured by dejection, and overwhelmed with <lb/>
            grief; and his admiration began to lead him insensibly into <lb/>
            love. As for Theagenes, he had some distant and obscure <lb/>
            recollection of having seen him before. While he was gazing <lb/>
            on one, and then trying to recall the other to his mind, <lb/>
            Cybele returned. She had told Arsace everything she had <lb/>
            done, relative to the young pair. She congratulated her on <lb/>
            her good fortune, which had effected without trouble what <lb/>
            she could else hardly have hoped to obtain by a thousand <lb/>
            schemes and contrivances ; which had lodged her lover under <lb/>
            her own roof, and afforded her the unrestrained and unsus­ <lb/>
            pected liberty of seeing, and being seen by him.</p>
          <p>With this discourse she stimulated her passion to such a <lb/>
            degree, that she could scarcely prevent her hastening to an <lb/>
            immediate interview with Theagenes, by suggesting that <lb/>
            it should not take place while as yet her face was pale, and <lb/>
            her eyes swelled, from the distraction in which she had <lb/>
            passed the preceding night. She advised her te compose <lb/>
            herselffor that day, and stay till she had recovered her <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιός</foreign>—hoary, venerable. See uses of the word in Scott and <lb/>
            Liddell's Lexicon. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            former beauty. She arranged with her how she was to treat <lb/>
            and manage her guests; and left her full of hopes and <lb/>
            flattering expectations. Then returning to her apartment, <lb/>
            and coming upon her son employed as he was about the door, <lb/>
            sibe asked him what he was so curiously prying into.</p>
          <p>" I am examining the strangers within," said he ; “ who <lb/>
            are they ?—whence do they come ?”—“ It is not permitted <lb/>
            you to Know,” she replied; " nay, I advise you to conceal <lb/>
            what you have already discovered of them; and to avoid <lb/>
            their company as much as possible, for such is my mistress's <lb/>
            pleasure. The young man, easily persuaded by his mother, <lb/>
            retired; comprehending that Theagenes was reserved for <lb/>
            the private gratification of Arsace, and saying to himself as <lb/>
            be went away—“ Is not this the man whom I received from <lb/>
            the Commandant Mithranes, to carry to Oroondates, that he <lb/>
            might be sent to the Great King ?—Was he not taken <lb/>
            away from me by Thyamis, and the men of Bessa, when I <lb/>
            narrowly hazarded my life, and was almost the only one of <lb/>
            the party who escaped ?-It surely is so, if I can believe my <lb/>
            eyes, which are now better, and serve me nearly as well as <lb/>
            ever. Besides, I heard that Thyamis returned here yester­ <lb/>
            day, and, after a single combat with his brother, recovered <lb/>
            the priesthood. This is undoubtedly the n an I mean : for <lb/>
            the present, however, I will conceal my knowledge of him, <lb/>
            and observe in silence my mistress's intentions with regard <lb/>
            to these young people.”—Thus he muttered to himself.</p>
          <p>Cybele hastened to her guests, and detected some traces <lb/>
            of the sorrows which had them employed in her absence; for <lb/>
            though,at the noise she made in opening the doors, they endea­ <lb/>
            voured to compose their dress and looks and manner as well <lb/>
            as they were able, yet they could not conceal from the pene­ <lb/>
            trating old woman that they had been agitated and in tears.</p>
          <p>“My dear children, she cried out, “ why do I see this ill- <lb/>
            timed grief, when you ought to rejoice, and congratulate <lb/>
            yourselves upon your good fortune ? Arsace manifests the <lb/>
            kindest disposition towards you; she will permit you to <lb/>
            come into her presence to-morrow, and, in the mean time, <lb/>
            has ordered you to be received and treated with every atten­ <lb/>
            tion and regard. Dry then these unseasonable and childish <lb/>
            tears, clear your countenances, and compose and conform <lb/>
            yourselves in everything, according to the pleasure of your <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            great benefactress.”—“ The remembrance of Calasiris,“ <lb/>
            replied Theagenes, " and the loss we have sustained in being <lb/>
            so soon deprived of his friendly attentions, called forth our <lb/>
            tears.”—“ This is foolish,” said the old woman; " why are <lb/>
            you so affected at so common and trifling an event ? Cala­ <lb/>
            siris was but an adopted father, and, by the course of nature, <lb/>
            could not last long; whereas you arc now in favour with <lb/>
            one who will shower upon you rank, riches, pleasures, every­ <lb/>
            thing which your age (now that you are in the bloom of <lb/>
            youth) ean enjoy, or your warmest wishes hope for. Look <lb/>
            on Arsace as your good genius-as your goddess Fortune— <lb/>
            and fall down before her! Only be ruled by me in what <lb/>
            manner you are to approach her, and comport yourselves <lb/>
            when she admits you to an interview; conform yourselves <lb/>
            to her pleasure, and obey her orders; for she is young, a <lb/>
            princess, proud also of her beauty, and will not bear to have <lb/>
            her will disputed, or her commands disregarded."*</p>
          <p>Theagenes made no answer, his mind misgiving him that <lb/>
            matters of an unworthy and unwelcome nature were being <lb/>
            hinted at. In the meantime some eunuchs arrived, bringing <lb/>
            with them, in golden dishes, delicacies which remained from <lb/>
            the royal table, which were in the highest degree sumptuous <lb/>
            and choice. † After saying that their mistress sends them <lb/>
            out of honour to the strangers, and having placed them <lb/>
            upon the board, they departed. The young people, at the <lb/>
            suggestion of Cybele, and that they might not seem to <lb/>
            despise the favour of the princess, just tasted what was set <lb/>
            before them: and the like honour was repeated to them in the <lb/>
            evening as well as on other days. Early the next morning the <lb/>
            same eunuchs again appeared, and thus addressed Theagenes: <lb/>
            " Most enviable among men! you arc sent for by my <note type="footnote"> * “ To bear and to obey had been from birth <lb/>

              mistress: she has ordered us to introduce you to her <lb/>
              presence-an honour and happiness which fare to the lot of <lb/>
              very few." He paused a little: at length he arose, with a <lb/>
              very unwilling air: and asked,—“ If he alone were sent for, <lb/>
              and not his sister also?”—“ He only, at present," they <lb/>
              replied: " his sister should have a private interview another <lb/>
              time; now several of the Persian nobles were with Arsace; <lb/>
              and besides, it was the custom that men and women should <lb/>
              be separately received and admitted to an audience." <lb/>
              Theagenes, stooping, whispered to Chariclea:—“ All is not <lb/>
              right; this is most suspicious.”—She softly advised him, not <lb/>
              at first to contradict Arsace, but to feign a willingness to <lb/>
              comply with everything which was desired of him.</p>
          <p>He then followed his conductors who officiously instructed <lb/>
            him in what manner he should address and converse with <lb/>
            the princess; and what ceremonies and obeisances were <lb/>
            usual aDd necessary in apearing before her: but he answered <lb/>
            nothing. At length they arrived in her presence: they <lb/>
            found her sitting on a lofty throne-her dress gorgeous with <lb/>
            gold and purple—her tiara and necklace sparkling with the <lb/>
            most costly gems—and her whole person set off with all the <lb/>
            appliances of art-her guards standing around her, and some <lb/>
            of the principal nobles and magistrates sitting on each side. <lb/>
            Theagenes was neither dazzled nor confounded by all this <lb/>
            splendour: he forgot, in a moment, the simulated cOIn. <lb/>
            plaisance which had been recommended to him by Chariclea: <lb/>
            rather did he feel his pride rebel at sight of the Persian <lb/>
            pomp: neither bending the knee, nor prostrating himself, <lb/>
            but with an erect countenance*—“ Hail," he said, “ 0 royal <lb/>
            Arsace!" They in the presence were indignant, and a <lb/>
            murmur of disapprobation ran through the circle : every one <lb/>
            blamed the daring rudeness of Theagenes, who presumed to <lb/>
            address the princess without the usual prostration. But <lb/>
            she, smiling, said­ <lb/>
            " Forgive a foreigner, unaccustomed to forms; and, above <note type="footnote"> * a, He stood like Atlas with a world of words <lb/>

            all, a Greek, infected with the national contempt towards <lb/>
            Persians." And then she raised the tiara from her head, to <lb/>
            the astonishment, and manifest dislike, of those about her; <lb/>
            for this is what the viceroys do when they return the salute <lb/>
            of those who pay them homage. " Be of good cheer, <lb/>
            stranger," said she, by an interpreter (for though she under­ <lb/>
            stood Greek she did not speak it); " if you desire anything, <lb/>
            scruple not to acquaint me, nor doubt to obtain your wish:" <lb/>
            and then making a signal to her eunuchs, she dismissed him, <lb/>
            and he was ceremoniously re-conducted, with a train of <lb/>
            guards, to his apartments.</p>
          <p>Achæmenes having now had a nearer view of him, recol­ <lb/>
            lected him well-wondered at, yet suspected the cause of <lb/>
            the honours which were paid him, but kept the silence <lb/>
            which was recommended to him by his mother. Arsace <lb/>
            proceeded to receive her nobles at an entertainment, appa­ <lb/>
            rently out of respect to them, but really to celebrate her own <lb/>
            joy at having had an interview with Theagenes. To him she <lb/>
            sent not only portions of the viands set before her, as usual, <lb/>
            but carpets and embroidered tapestry, the work of Tyrian <lb/>
            and Lydian skill. She sent likewise two beautiful slaves tc <lb/>
            wait upon them—a maid to Chariclea, and a boy to Thea­ <lb/>
            genes, both from Ionia, and in the bloom of youth.</p>
          <p>She was urgent with Cybele to lose no time, but to bring <lb/>
            about, as soon as possible, what she had so much at heart: <lb/>
            for her passion was now too strong for her endurance. <lb/>
            Cybele, accordingly, was to relax none of her endeavours, <lb/>
            but was to circumvent Theagenes with all her arts. She <lb/>
            did not openly explain the wishes of her mistress, but gave <lb/>
            him to guess at them by hints and circumlocutions. She <lb/>
            magnified her good-will towards him—took every occasion to <lb/>
            extol the beauties of her person, as well those which appeared <lb/>
            to every beholder as those which her attire kept concealed: <lb/>
            she commended her graceful manners and amiable disposition, <lb/>
            and assured him that a brave and handsome youth was cer­ <lb/>
            tain of finding favour with her. All this while she endea­ <lb/>
            voured in what she said to sound his temper, whether it <lb/>
            were amorous and easily inflamed.</p>
          <p>Theagenes thanked her for her good inclinations towards <lb/>
            the Greeks, and professed himself obliged by the peculiar <lb/>
            kindness and benevolence with which she had treated him.</p><pb n="170"/>
            
          <p>But all her innuendoes, relating to other matters, he passed <lb/>
            over, and appeared as though he did not understand them. <lb/>
            This was a vast annoyance to the old beldame, and her heart <lb/>
            began almost to fail her; for she had penetration enough to <lb/>
            see that Theagenes understood very well the end she aimed <lb/>
            at, but was averse to, and determined to repel, all her over­ <lb/>
            tures. She knew that Arsace could not brook a much longer <lb/>
            delay. She had already experienced the violence of her <lb/>
            temper, which was now inflamed by the ardour of her present <lb/>
            passion. She was daily demanding the fulfilment of her <lb/>
            promise, which Cybele put off on various pretences; some­ <lb/>
            times saying, that the youth's inclinations towards her were <lb/>
            chilled by his timidity-at others, feigning that some indis­ <lb/>
            position had attacked him. At length, when nearly a week <lb/>
            had ineffectually elapsed, and the princess had admitted <lb/>
            Chariclea to more than one interview; when out of regard <lb/>
            to her pretended brother, she had treated her with tho <lb/>
            greatest kindness and respect; Cybele was at length obliged <lb/>
            to speak out more plainly to Theagenes, and make an unvar­ <lb/>
            nished declaration of her mistress's love to him.</p>
          <p>She blamed his backwardness, and promised that his com­ <lb/>
            pliance should be followed by the most splendid rewards. <lb/>
            “Why," said she, " are you so averse to love ? Is it not <lb/>
            strange that one of your age should overlook the advances <lb/>
            of a woman like Arsace—young, and beautiful as yourself— <lb/>
            and should not esteem her favours as so much treasure­ <lb/>
            trove,. especially when you may indulge your inclinations <lb/>
            without the smallest apprehension of danger-her husband <lb/>
            being at a distance, and her nurse the confidante of her <lb/>
            secrets, and entirely devoted to her service, being here, ready <lb/>
            to manage and conceal your interviews? There are no <lb/>
            obstacles in your way. You have neither a wife nor a <lb/>
            betrothed; although in such circumstances, even these <lb/>
            relations have been overlooked by many men of sense, who <lb/>
            have considered that they should not really hurt their <lb/>
            families, but should gain wealth and pleasure to themselves." <lb/>
            She began to hint, at last, that there might be danger in his <lb/>
            refusal. " Women, it says she, " tender-hearted and ardent <lb/>
            in their desires, are enraged at a repulse, and seldom fail to <lb/>
            revenge themselves upon those who overlook their advances. <note type="footnote"> * 1pra7a; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρμαιον</foreign>—a windfall; a godsend. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            -Reflect, moreover, that my mistress is a Persian, of the <lb/>
            royal family, and has ample means in her bands of reward­ <lb/>
            ing those whom she favours, and punishing those who she <lb/>
            thinks have injured her. You are a stranger, destitute, and <lb/>
            with no one to defend you. Spare yourself danger, and spare <lb/>
            Arsace a disappointment: she is worthy of some regard from <lb/>
            you, who has shown and feels such intensity of passion for <lb/>
            you : beware of a loving woman's anger, and dread that <lb/>
            revenge which follows neglected love. I have known more <lb/>
            than one repent of his coldness.—These grey hairs have had <lb/>
            longer experience in love aflairs than JOlt, yet have I never <lb/>
            seen any one so unimpressible and harsh as you are."</p>
          <p>Addressing herself then to Chariclea (for, urged by ne­ <lb/>
            cessity, she ventured to hold this discourse before her), <lb/>
            “ Do you, my child," says she, join your exhortations to <lb/>
            mine; endeavour to bend this brother of yours, to whom I <lb/>
            know not what name to give. If you succeed, you shall <lb/>
            find the advantage great to yourself; you will not lose his <lb/>
            love and you will gain more honour; riches will shower <lb/>
            down upon you, and a splendid match will await you. These <lb/>
            are enviable circumstances to any the chiefest of the na­ <lb/>
            tives ; how much more to foreigners who are in poverty ! <lb/>
            Chariclea, with a bitter smile, replied­</p>
          <p>" It were to be wished that the breast of the most excel­ <lb/>
            lent lady, Arsace, had felt no such passion; or that, having <lb/>
            felt it, she had had fortitude sufficient to bear and to repress <lb/>
            it. But if the weakness of her nature has sunk under the <lb/>
            force of love, I would counsel my brother no longer to re­ <lb/>
            fuse responding to it, if it may be done with any degree of <lb/>
            security-if it may be possible to avoid the dangers which <lb/>
            I see impending from the Viceroy's wrath, should he become <lb/>
            acquainted with the dishonourable affair which is going on."</p>
          <p>At these words Cybele sprang forwards, and, embracing <lb/>
            and kissing Chariclea, “How I love you, my dear child; <lb/>
            she exclaimed, " for the compassion you shew for the suffer­ <lb/>

            safety of your brother; But here you may be perfectly at <lb/>
            ease-the very sun shall know nothing of what passes.” <lb/>
            “Cease for the present," replied Theagenes seriously, “and <lb/>
            give me time for consideration."</p>
          <p>Cybele upon this went out, and—“ 0 Theagenes!” said <lb/>
            Chariclea, " the evil genius who persecutes us has given us a <lb/>
            specious appearance of good fortune, with which there is <lb/>
            really intermixed more of evil; but since things have so <lb/>
            turned out, it is a great part of wisdom to draw some good, <lb/>
            if possible, from each untoward accident. Whether you are <lb/>
            determined to comply with the proposal which has been <lb/>
            made to you, it is not for me to say. Perhaps, if our pre­ <lb/>
            serration depended upon your compliance, I might recon­ <lb/>
            cile myself to it; but if your spirit revolts at the com­ <lb/>
            plaisance which is expected from you, feign at least that you <lb/>
            consent, and feed with promises the barbaric woman's <lb/>
            passion. By these means you will prevent her from iimme­ <lb/>
            diately determining any thing harshly against us: lead her <lb/>
            on by hope, which will soften her mind, and hinder her anger <lb/>
            from breaking out: thus we shall gain time, and in the inter­ <lb/>
            val some happy accident, or some propitious deity, may deliver <lb/>
            us from the perplexities with which we are surrounded. But <lb/>
            beware, my dear Theagenes, that by dwelling in thought <lb/>
            upon the matter you do not fall into the sin in deed."</p>
          <p>Theagenes, smiling, replied,—“No misfortunes, I see-DO <lb/>
            embarrassments can cure a woman of the innate disease of <lb/>
            jealousy: but be comforted, I am incapable of even feigning <lb/>
            what you advise. In my mind, it is alike unbecoming to do <lb/>
            or to say an unworthy thing; and there will be one advan­ <lb/>
            tage in driving Arsace to despair-that she will give us no <lb/>
            farther trouble on this subject; and whatever else I am des­ <lb/>
            tined to suffer, my bent of mind and my bitter experience <lb/>
            have but too well prepared me to bear.“—Chariclea having <lb/>
            said, " I fear you are bringing ruin upon our heads,“—held <lb/>
            her peace.</p>
          <p>While this conversation employed the lovers, Cybele went <lb/>
            to Arsace, and encouraged her to hope for a favourable issue <lb/>
            to her desires, for that Theagenes had intimated as much, <lb/>
            she returned to her own apartments. She said no more <lb/>
            that evening; but having in the night earnestly besough* <lb/>
            Chariclea, who shared her bed, to co-operate with her, in <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            the morning she again attacked Theagenes, and inquired <lb/>
            what he bad resolved upon ; when he uttered a plain down­ <lb/>
            right refusal, and absolutely forbad her expecting any com­ <lb/>
            plaisance from him of the sort she wished. She returned <lb/>
            disappointed and sorrowful to her mistress; who, as soon as <lb/>
            she was made acquainted with the stern refusal of Theage. <lb/>
            nes, ordering the old woman to be ejected headlong out of <lb/>
            the palace, entered into her chamber, and, throwing herself <lb/>
            upon the bed, began to tear her hair, and beat her breast.— <lb/>
            Cybele was returning home in disgrace, when her son <lb/>
            Achæmenes met her, and, seeing her in tears, asked—" if <lb/>
            any misfortune had happened to her ?-Or has our mis­ <lb/>
            tress," said he, " received any bad news ?-Has any calamity <lb/>
            befallen the army (-Has Oroondates been defeated by the <lb/>
            Æthiopians ? "</p>
          <p>He was running on in this manner with his questions, <lb/>
            when his mother stopped him.—" Have done trifling," said <lb/>
            nhc, " and let me alone." She was going away: he followed <lb/>
            her, and taking her by the hand, besought her earnestly to ex­ <lb/>
            plain to him, her son, the cause of her sorrow. She suffered <lb/>
            herself to be led by him into a retired part of the garden, <lb/>
            and then said</p>
          <p>" I would not to any one else disclose my own and my <lb/>
            mistresses distresses ; but since she is in the extremes! agi­ <lb/>
            tation, and I am in danger of my life (for I fear the worst <lb/>
            from her rage and disappointment), I will venture to speak, <lb/>
            in case you should be able to think of any thing that may <lb/>
            comfort and assist your poor mother. Arsace is in love with <lb/>
            the young man who is now at my apartments: she burns <lb/>
            with no common affection, but with inflamed and un­ <lb/>
            governable passion; and when both of us thought it an <lb/>
            easy matter for her to satisfy her inclinations, we have been <lb/>
            miserably disappointed. To this cause you are to attribute <lb/>
            the attentions which have been paid to, and the favours <lb/>
            which have been showered upon, the strangers; but since <lb/>
            this stupid, rash, and unbending youth has rejected all our <lb/>
            advances, she, I think, will not survive it; and I anticipate <lb/>
            destruction for myself. This, my child, is the cause of my <lb/>
            present affliction:—if you have it in your power to assist <lb/>
            me, do it quickly, or else prepare shortly to pay the last <lb/>
            rites over my tomb."</p><pb n="174"/>
            
          <p>“What shall be my reward P replied Achæmenes, for it is <lb/>
            necessary to come directly to the point: it is not a time, in <lb/>
            your present confusion and distress, to delay you with long <lb/>
            discourse."</p>
          <p>"Ask whatever you please," replied Cybele : "I have <lb/>
            already, by my interest, made you head-cupbearer: if you <lb/>
            are desirous of any greater dignity, tell me so: there is no <lb/>
            degree of wealth, or honour, to which you may not aspire, <lb/>
            if you can procure Arsace the means of satisfying her in­ <lb/>
            clinations.'</p>
          <p>“ I have long suspected this passion of the princess," re­ <lb/>
            plied the young man, “but kept silence, waiting the event. <lb/>
            I am not covetous of riches, or ambitious of place ; if she <lb/>
            can procure me in marriage the maiden who is called the <lb/>
            sister of Theagenes, I think I may promise that every thing <lb/>
            else shall happen according to her wishes. I am desperately <lb/>
            in love with this young woman. Your mistress, who knows <lb/>
            by experience the force of this passion, may very reasonably <lb/>
            be brought to assist a fellow sufferer in it, especially when, <lb/>
            by so doing, she may probably meet with success in her own <lb/>
            pursuits."</p>
          <p>" Doubt not," said Cybele, "of her gratitude. She will do <lb/>
            anything for you, if you can be of real service to her in this <lb/>
            affair; nay, we may perhaps, ourselves persuade the maiden; <lb/>
            but explain, I beg of you, in what manner you propose to <lb/>
            assist us."</p>
          <p>" I will not say a word," he replied, " till Arsace has <lb/>
            promised, and sworn, to grant me what I desire: and do <lb/>
            not you by any means at present enter upon the subject <lb/>
            with the young woman. She too, I can see, is of a high <lb/>
            and lofty spirit; you may spoil all by undue rashness.”— <lb/>
            “I will act just as you shall direct,” replied Cybele ; and <lb/>
            running into her mistress's apartment, the fell at her feet, <lb/>
            and bid her be of good cheer, for every thing now should <lb/>
            happen as she would have it—“ Only,” said sabe, " admit my <lb/>
            son Achæmenes to an audience."</p>
          <p>" Let him come in," replied the princess ; but take care <lb/>
            that you do not again deceive me.” Achæmenes was upon <lb/>
            this Introduced-his mother explained his wishes, and made <lb/>
            known his promises-and Arsace swore to procure for him <lb/>
            the hand of Chariclea. He then said­</p><pb n="175"/>
            
          <p>“Let Theagenes give over all his airs; he who is a slave, <lb/>
            yet dares to behave with insolence to his mistress.”—Being <lb/>
            desired to explain himself, he related all he knew—How <lb/>
            Theagenes was taken captive in war by Mithranes, who was <lb/>
            about to send him to Oroondates, in order that be might <lb/>
            convey him to the Great King-that he was rescued in the <lb/>
            way by Thyamis and the men of Bessa—that he, Achæ­ <lb/>
            menes, with difficulty escaped from them—that he was for­ <lb/>
            tunate enough to have with him the letters of Mithranes.” <lb/>
            And upon this he produced and shewed them to Arsace; <lb/>
            and appealed to Thyamis for the truth of all he had said.</p>
          <p>Arsace began to conceive hope from these tidings, and, <lb/>
            immediately issuing from her chamber, repaired to the hall <lb/>
            of audience, where, seating herself upon her throne, she <lb/>
            commanded Theagenes to be brought before her.</p>
          <p>When he appeared, she asked him if he knew Achæ­ <lb/>
            menes, whom she pointed out to him, standing near her. <lb/>
            He replied that he did.—“ Was he not," said she, " bring­ <lb/>
            ing you hither a captive, some short time ago ?” He ad­ <lb/>
            mitted that also.— “You are my slave then," said she, " and <lb/>
            as such, shall do as I direct you. and, whether you will or <lb/>
            no, be obedient to my commands. This sister of yours I <lb/>
            give in marriage to Achæmenes, who fills a principal station <lb/>
            in my court, as well for his own good deserts, as out of the <lb/>
            regard I have for his mother; and I will defer the nuptials <lb/>
            only till a day is fixed, and preparation made for due splen­ <lb/>
            dour in their celebration."</p>
          <p>Theagences was pierced as with a sword at this address, <lb/>
            but determined not to thwart her, but rather to elude her <lb/>
            attack as that of a wild beast.—“ 0 princess," be replied, <lb/>
            " in the midst of my calamities I give the gods thanks, that <lb/>
            since I, whose life was originally fortunate, and family illus­ <lb/>
            trious, am destined to be a slave, I have fallen into your <lb/>
            power, rather than into that of any other; into yours, who, <lb/>
            while you considered us as strangers and foreigners, have <lb/>
            treated us with so much compassion and humanity. As for <lb/>
            my sister, although, not being a captive, she is not a slave ; <lb/>
            yet her own inclination will lead her to serve and obey you <lb/>
            in every thing: dispose of her, therefore, as shall seem good <lb/>
            in your eyes."-“ Let him," Arsace then said, " be placed <lb/>
            among the waiters at the royal table; let Achæmenes in­ <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            struet him in the art of cup-bearing, that he may, without <lb/>
            delay, become expert in the services which will be required <lb/>
            of him,"</p>
          <p>Theagenes was now permitted to retire, which be did; <lb/>
            Borrowing, and meditating deeply on what he had farther <lb/>
            to do.</p>
          <p>Achæmenes, elated with the success of his project, bad the <lb/>
            cruelty to insult him.-“ You," said he, who were just now <lb/>
            so haughty, who seemed alone a freeman among slaves ; who <lb/>
            held your head so high, and refused to bow it even before <lb/>
            the princess must now learn to bend it, or else my knuckles <lb/>
            shall teach you better manners."</p>
          <p>Arsace was left alone with Cybele.-“ Now," said she, <lb/>
            It nurse, every excuse is taken from this proud Grecian; go <lb/>
            to him and tell him, that if he will comply with what I re­ <lb/>
            quire of him, he shall obtain his liberty, and spend his life <lb/>
            in affiuence and pleasure; but if he still continues sullen <lb/>
            and reluctant, assure him that he shall feel the wrath of an <lb/>
            angry mistress, and a disappointed woman; that punish­ <lb/>
            ments of every kind await him. and that he shall be con­ <lb/>
            demned to the lowest and most disgraceful slavery." Cybele <lb/>
            performed her embassy without delay; and added, from <lb/>
            herself, whatever she thought most likely to work upon his <lb/>
            hopes or fears.</p>
          <p>Theagenes demanded a short time for consideration ; and <lb/>
            going alone to Chariclea, he exclaitned-“ We are undone, <lb/>
            my dearest Chariclea! every cable of safety is broken, every <lb/>
            anchor of hope is lost; nor have we now the name of liberty <lb/>
            to console us in our misfortunes, but are again fallen into <lb/>
            servitude."—He explained his meaning, and related what <lb/>
            had hnppened.-“ We are now," he added, “ exposed to the <lb/>
            insults of barbarians; we must obey all their commands or <lb/>
            suffer the extremes! punishments; and as if this were not <lb/>
            sufficient, what is above all the rest intolerable, know that <lb/>
            Arsace has promised to give you in wedlock to Achæmenes, <lb/>
            the son of Cybele; but this, while I have life, an arm, and <lb/>
            a sword, I will either prevent or never see. But what ought <lb/>
            we now to do ? What contrivance can we imagine to avoid <lb/>
            this detestable union, of you with Achæmenes, of me with <lb/>
            A rsace ? "</p>
          <p>" If you will condescend to the one yourself," replied <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            Chariclea, “ you will easily find means to hinder the <lb/>
            other."</p>
          <p>" Have a care what you say!" replied Theagenes, eagerly, <lb/>
            " God forbid that any persecution of fate should drive the <lb/>
            faithful, though yet unrewarded lover of Chariclea, to stoop to <lb/>
            another, and that an unlawful union; but a thought comes <lb/>
            into my head, for necessity. is the mother of invention <lb/>
            and so saying, he immediately sought Cybele, and bade <lb/>
            tell her mistress that he wished to have an interview with <lb/>
            her alone.</p>
          <p>The old woman, concluding that he was now about to give <lb/>
            wav, joyfully delivered the message, and Arsace ordered her <lb/>
            to bring him to the palace after supper. Cybele bade those <lb/>
            in waiting withdraw, so that her mistress might be in private <lb/>
            and undisturbed, and introduced Theagenes when the shades <lb/>
            of night began to envelope every thing in obscurity. A <lb/>
            single lamp burnt in the chamber; and as soon as they <lb/>
            were entered, she was preparing to retire, but Theagenes <lb/>
            stopped her.—" Let Cybele, 0 princess!" said he, “ if you <lb/>
            please, remain for the present; I know she is a very faithful <lb/>
            keeper of secrets;" and taking Arsace's hand, he went on : <lb/>
            —“ 0 my mistress! I did not presume at first to dispute <lb/>
            your will, or defer my submission to your commands, for <lb/>
            any other reason than that I might obey them with greater <lb/>
            security; but now, since the will of fortune has in its <lb/>
            kindness made me your slave, I am much more ready to <lb/>
            obey your pleasure. One thing only I desire of you—of <lb/>
            you who have promised me so many-break off the marriage <lb/>
            of Chariclea with Achæmenes; for, to waive other objec­ <lb/>
            tions, a maiden of her noble birth is no fit wife for the son <lb/>
            of a slave. If this be not granted me, I swear by all that <lb/>
            is sacred that I will never comply with your wishes; and if <lb/>
            the least violence is offered to Chariclea, you shall soon see <lb/>
            me dead at your feet."</p>
          <p>" You may be sure," replied Arsace, “ that I, who am <lb/>
            willing to surrender even myself, desire in everything to <lb/>
            oblige you ; but I have sworn to give your sister to Achæ­ <lb/>
            menes. —“ Let not that trouble you," said he, “ you may <lb/>
            give him any sister of mine; but my mistress,! my intended. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig29.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="178"/>
              my betrothed in short, you neither would wish to bestow, <lb/>
              nor shall you bestow, upon him."</p>
          <p>“ What mean you?" said she.—“ Nothing but the <lb/>
            truth," replied he, " for Chariclea is really not my sister, <lb/>
            but my intended wife; you are, therefore, absolved from <lb/>
            your oath; and if you wish for a farther confirmation of <lb/>
            my words, you may, as soon as it please you, give order for <lb/>
            the celebration of our nuptials."</p>
          <p>Arsace was much annoyed; and heard, not without <lb/>
            jealousy, the true relation in which Chariclea stood to <lb/>
            Theagenes ; but, at present, only snid,-“ If you will have <lb/>
            it so, this marriage shall be broken off, and I will seek out <lb/>
            another wife for Achaimenes."—“ When this matter is <lb/>
            settled," replied Theagenes, " dispose of me as you please, <lb/>
            I will perform all I have promised." He then approached <lb/>
            in order to kiss her hands. She, however, instead of prc­ <lb/>
            senting her hand, saluted him with her lips; and he left <lb/>
            the presence kissed, but not kissing in return.</p>
          <p>On his return to Chariclea, he disclosed to her all that <lb/>
            had passed, (at which she, too, was not free from jealousy.) <lb/>
            setting before her the secret intention of his promise, the <lb/>
            good results which he anticipated from it. In the first place, <lb/>
            the project of Achæmenes' marriage would be marred, a fair <lb/>
            pretext would be afforded for deferring at present the com­ <lb/>
            pletion of Arsnce's wishes; and what was worth more than <lb/>
            all, there was the certainty that Achæmenes would make <lb/>
            "confusion worse confounded," upon finding his expectations <lb/>
            blighted, and himself supplanted in the princess's good graces <lb/>
            by another favourite. 1 took care (he said) to have his <lb/>
            mother present at the interview, and a witness that our inter­ <lb/>
            course was but in words; she will keep nothing secret from her <lb/>
            son. It may suffice perhaps (he added) to avoid all occa­ <lb/>
            sion for an evil conscience, and to trust only in the protec­ <lb/>
            tion of the gods; but it is good also to avoid all occasion <lb/>
            for an evil conscience in the sight of men, so as to pass <lb/>
            through this transitory life with virtuous boldness. " There <lb/>
            is every reason to believe," added lie, “ that a slave like <lb/>
            Achæmenes, will conspire against his mistress; for the <lb/>
            Bubject commonly hates the cause of his subjection, and <lb/>
            this man has no occasion to invent a pretext for rebellion <lb/>
            (as has been the case with many), he is really wronged, has <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            been deceived, and sees another preferred before him; be <lb/>
            Is conscious to the profligacy of his mistress, and has a <lb/>
            motive ready to his hand."</p>
          <p>He held this discourse to Chariclea, endeavouring to <lb/>
            revive in her a hope of better things. On the morrow he <lb/>
            was sent for by Achæmenes to serve at the table, for such <lb/>
            were Arsace's commands. He was arrayed in a Persian <lb/>
            robe of great value, which was sent by her at the same time, <lb/>
            and adorned partly against his will, with bracelets and <lb/>
            jewelled necklaces.</p>
          <p>Upon arriving at the palace, Achæmenes offered to in­ <lb/>
            struct him in the functions of his office; but, hastening to <lb/>
            the sideboard, and taking up a precious goblet, ho said,­ <lb/>
            "I need no instructor, selt-taught, I will wait upon my <lb/>
            mistress, making no bustle about such trifles. Your fortune <lb/>
            has forced you perhaps to learn your trade; nature and the <lb/>
            spur of the moment will teach me what I am to do." So <lb/>
            saying, he lightly, and with a grace, poured out the wine, <lb/>
            and handed the cup upon his finger ends.*</p>
          <p>The draught inflamed the mind of Arsace more than <lb/>
            ever. Slowly sipping, she fixed her eyes intently upon <lb/>
            Theagenes, taking in at the same time large draughts of <lb/>
            love; neither did she drain the goblet, but left a portion of <lb/>
            its contents, in which Theagenes might pledge her. A <lb/>
            wound of a very different nature rankled in the bosom of <lb/>
            Achælnenes: anger, envy, and resentment manifested them­ <lb/>
            selves on his countenance, so that Arsace could not help <lb/>
            observing it, and whispered something to those who were <lb/>
            nearest her.</p>
          <p>When the entertainment broke up—“ Grant me," said <lb/>
            Theagenes, "my mistress! this first boon which I shall <lb/>
            ask—permit me alone to wear this dress when serving at <lb/>
            your table." Arsace agreed to his request, and putting on <lb/>
            his ordinary raiment, he departed. Achæmenes followed <lb/>
            him, sharply upbraided him with his want of manners; <lb/>
            telling him, too, that there was a forwardness and fami­ <note type="footnote"> * An illustration of this nicety in waiting occurs in Xen. Cyrop., <lb/>

              liarity in him, which, though they might at first be over­ <lb/>
              looked, in consideration of his youth and inexperience, would <lb/>
              in the end, if not corrected, infallibly give offence. He gave <lb/>
              him these cautions, be said, out of a friendly feeling, and <lb/>
              particularly as he was shortly to become related to him by <lb/>
              marrying his sister, according to his mistress'is promise.</p>
          <p>He was proceeding with his good advice; but Theagenes, <lb/>
            his eyes fixed in deep thought on the ground, seemed not <lb/>
            to hear, and was preparing to leave him, when Cybele <lb/>
            joined them, on her way to conduct her mistress to take <lb/>
            her usual siesta.* Seeing her son sorrowful, and apparently <lb/>
            out of humour, she inquired into the cause of it.—“ This <lb/>
            foreign youth," said he, “ thanks to his specious person, is <lb/>
            preferred to all of us, the ancient chamberlains and cup­ <lb/>
            bearers; to-day he has already wormed himself into our <lb/>
            mistress<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign>s good graces, and has waited nearest her royal <lb/>
            person, presenting the cup to her, and thrusting us out of <lb/>
            our former dignity, which has become no more than an <lb/>
            empty name. We ought, perhaps, to bear without mur- <lb/>
            Inuring, if we cannot feel without envy, the honours he <lb/>
            receives, and the confidence to which he is admitted, since <lb/>
            we have had the weakness, by our negligence and silence, <lb/>
            to assist in his success; our mistress, however, might have <lb/>
            done all this without affronting and disgracing her old <lb/>
            servants, who moreover are in all her secrets. But some <lb/>
            other time will serve for speaking farther on this subject: <lb/>
            at present, let me go and see my charming Chariclea, my <lb/>
            promised bride; that, by her sweet aspect, I may soothe <lb/>
            the annoyance of my mind."</p>
          <p>" What bride do you talk of pIt replied Cybele, " you <lb/>
            seem to me to take fire at small and imaginary offences, <lb/>
            and to be ignorant of the real and deep ones which you have <lb/>
            received. Chariclea is no longer destined for your wife."</p>
          <p>" What say you?" he exclaimed, “ am not I a very <lb/>
            fitting match for my fellow-slave ? What can have wrought <lb/>
            this sudden change?”—“ Our own too great fidelity and <lb/>
            zeal in serving Arsace;” replied Cybele, " for after that we <lb/>
            have preferred her caprices to our own safety; when, in <lb/>
            compliance with her desires, we have endangered ourselves, <lb/>
            and have put the accomplishment of her wishes into her <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="181"/>
              power, this noble youth, this dainty favourite, enters her <lb/>
              chamber, and at first sight persuades her to break through <lb/>
              all her oaths, and to promise Chariclea to himself; who <lb/>
              now, as be affirms, is no longer his sister, but his mistress."</p>
          <p>“ And is Chariclea indeed promised to Theagenes?” said <lb/>
            Achæmenes.—“ It is but too true," replied Cybele, " I was <lb/>
            present myself and heard it; they even talked of the <lb/>
            nuptial feast, and of celebrating it shortly; proposing to <lb/>
            satisfy you with the hand of some one else."</p>
          <p>At this mortifying intelligence Achæmenes, smiting his <lb/>
            hands together, and uttering a deep groan — “ I will make <lb/>
            this wedding a fatal one to them all,” said he; " only do <lb/>
            you assist me in endeavouring to put it off for a few days. <lb/>
            If any one inquires after me, say that I am indisposed and <lb/>
            gone into the country. This precious stranger's calling <lb/>
            her his betrothed is a mere pretext to break through the <lb/>
            engagements that have been made to me; his kissing, his <lb/>
            embracing her, nay, his sleeping with her, would not <lb/>
            clearly convince me that she is not his sister. I will sift <lb/>
            this business, and will vindicate the violated oaths and the <lb/>
            insulted gods." So saying, raging with love, jealousy, and <lb/>
            disappointment (feelings all the more violent in a barba­ <lb/>
            rian's breast), lie rushed out of the room; and without <lb/>
            giving himself time for consideration, in the first moments <lb/>
            of his passion, he secretly mounted, in the evening, an <lb/>
            Armenian horse, reserved for state occasions, and fled full <lb/>
            speed to Oroondates.</p>
          <p>The Viceroy was then in the neighbourhood of the <lb/>
            celebrated Thebes,* marshalling all his forces, and preparing <lb/>
            to lead them on an expedition against the Æthiopians. <lb/>

            of the war—the city of Philœ, always readv to fall a prey to <lb/>
            the first invader-and, by so doing, had reduced him to <lb/>
            great straits, and to a necessity of using sudden and hurried <lb/>
            efforts for its recovery.</p>
          <p>Philœ is situated a little above the smaller cataracts of <lb/>
            the Nile, about twelve miles distant from Syene and <lb/>
            Elephantis. The city was formerly seized upon and inha­ <lb/>
            bited by a band of Egyptian fugitives, which made it <lb/>
            debateable land between the governments of Egypt and <lb/>
            Æthiopia. The latter were for extending their dominions <lb/>
            as far as the cataracts, while the former claimed even the <lb/>
            city of Philœ, pretending that they had conquered it in <lb/>
            war, because it had been occupied by their exiles. It had <lb/>
            been taken and retaken several times by both nations; and <lb/>
            was, just before the time I am speaking of, held by an <lb/>
            Egyptian and Persian garrison.</p>
          <p>The king of Æthiopia dispatched an embassy to Croon­ <lb/>
            dales, to demand the restoration of the city and the emerald <lb/>
            mines; and meeting, as has been before observed,. with a <lb/>
            refusal, he sent ambassadors a second time towards Egypt; <lb/>
            (they going in advance) he following a few days later, with <lb/>
            a numerous army, set on foot beforehand, but keeping all <lb/>
            the while their destination a profound secret.</p>
          <p>When he concluded that his envoys had passed Philœ, and <lb/>
            bad lulled the inhabitants and garrison there into negligence <lb/>
            and security, by persuading them, as they were instructed, <lb/>
            that they were preparing to proceed farther on a peaceful <lb/>
            embassy; he on a sudden appeared before Philœ, in a few <lb/>
            days overwhelmed its surprised and unprepared defenders <lb/>
            (unable to resist his superior force and his artillery),t and <lb/>
            took posesssion of the city, which he kept, without injuring <lb/>
            any who dwelt in it.</p>
          <p>In the midst of these troubles Achæmenes found Oroon­ <lb/>
            dates, and by his sudden and unexpected appearance, helped <lb/>
            to increase them.-" Has any misfortune," hastily he in­ <lb/>
            quired, " happened to Arsace, or to any other of my family ?” <lb/>
            —" A misfortune has happened," replied Achæmenes, " but <lb/>
            I would speak to you in private."</p>
          <p>When every one had retired he entered upon his story. <lb/>
            He related the capture of Theagenes by Mithranes; how <note type="footnote"> * See Book II. and Book III. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              he was sent to him (Oroondates), in order to be conveyed, <lb/>
              if he thought proper, as a present to the Great King, to <lb/>
              whose court and table the youth would be a worthy orna­ <lb/>
              ment. He proceeded to narrate his rescue from them in <lb/>
              their journey by the men of Bessa, the death of Mithranes <lb/>
              in his defence, and his own subsequent arrival at Memphis, <lb/>
              introducing into his narrative the affairs also of Thyamis.</p>
          <p>At length he came to the ungoverned passion of Arsace— <lb/>
            the transfer of Theagenes into the palace-his too kind <lb/>
            reception there — his attendance and his cup-bearing— <lb/>
            ‘ Hitherto,” he added, " I believe nothing has actually taken <lb/>
            place, for the youth is coy and unwilling; but if this temp­ <lb/>
            tation be not taken away from before her eves-if Theagenes <lb/>
            be not speedily removed from Memphis—there is the greatest <lb/>
            reason to apprehend that time, fear, and artifices of various <lb/>
            kinds, will at length conquer his disinclination. On these <lb/>
            accounts I have taken an opportunity to leave the city pri­ <lb/>
            vately, and to come in all haste to make this discovery to <lb/>
            you, thinking it my duty no longer to conceal a matter in <lb/>
            which your honour and interest are so intimately con­ <lb/>
            cerned."</p>
          <p>When he had raised the resentment of Oroondates by <lb/>
            these tidings, and filled him with indignation and a desire of <lb/>
            revenge, he inflamed his desires when he came to dwell <lb/>
            upon the charms of Chariclea. He extolled her to the skies, <lb/>
            spoke of her beauty as divine ; saying that her equal never <lb/>
            had, and never would be seen. “ None of your concubines,” <lb/>
            said he, “ not those alone who are left at Memphis, but <lb/>
            those even who follow your person, are in any degree to be <lb/>
            compared with her." In this manner Achæmenes went on, <lb/>
            raising the curiosity and wishes of Oroondates, reckonings <lb/>
            that although the viceroy might indulge his fancy for Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea for a time, yet he might afterwards easily be induced <lb/>
            to give her up to him in marriage, as a reward for his dis­ <lb/>
            coveries.</p>
          <p>Urged on by anger and desire, the viceroy instantly sum­ <lb/>
            moned the eunuch Bagoas, who was in great favour and <lb/>
            authority, and commanded him to proceed directly to Mem­ <lb/>
            phis with a troop of fifty horse, and without fail or delay to <lb/>
            bring Theagenes and Chariclea to his camp, wherever he <lb/>
            should find them.</p><pb n="184"/>
            
          <p>He wrote at the same time a letter to Arsace to this <lb/>
            effect:</p>
          <p>“ Oroondates to Arsace.</p>
          <p>" Send to me Theagenes and Chariclea, the captive pair, <lb/>
            who are slaves to the Great King, and under orders to be <lb/>
            transmitted to him. Send them willingly, since, even if <lb/>
            you be unwilling, they will be taken from you; and then <lb/>
            the report of Achæmenes will be believed."</p>
          <p>To the chief eunuch at Memphis he wrote as follows:</p>
          <p>" You shall hereafter give an account of your negligence <lb/>
            as to my household; at present deliver the Grecian captives <lb/>
            to Bagoas, that they may be brought to me, whether Arsace <lb/>
            consent to it or not. Deliver them, I say, or the bearer of <lb/>
            these presents has orders to bring you hither in chains, <lb/>
            when you shall be flayed alive."</p>
          <p>Bagoas took the letters, signed with the viceroy's signet, <lb/>
            that they might obtain full credit, and set out for Memphis <lb/>
            to execute his master's orders.</p>
          <p>Oroondates now put himself in motion against the Æthio­ <lb/>
            pians, commanding Achæmenes to follow him, who was <lb/>
            watched and guarded without his knowing it, till it should <lb/>
            appear whether the information he had given were true. <lb/>
            Meanwhile at Memphis, soon after the departure of Achæ­ <lb/>
            menes, Thyamis had been completely invested with the offico <lb/>
            of high priest, and, as such, was become one of the chiefs of <lb/>
            the city.</p>
          <p>After he had celebrated, with proper piety, the funeral of <lb/>
            Calasiris, and observed, in mourning and retirement, the ap­ <lb/>
            pointed number of days-as soon as the sacred laws per­ <lb/>
            mitted him to hold communication with those who were <lb/>
            without the temple, his first care was to inquire after Thea­ <lb/>
            genes and Chariclea.</p>
          <p>He learned, with some difficulty, that they had been <lb/>
            removed to the viceroy's palace; and immediately on receiv­ <lb/>
            ing this intelligence he hastened to Arsace, to make inquiries <lb/>
            after them. He was solicitous about them on various <lb/>
            accounts; and particularly as his father had, with his last <lb/>
            breath, recommended them, in the strongest manner, to his <lb/>
            care and protection.</p>
          <p>He returned thanks to the princess for her goodness in <lb/>
            receiving and entertaining the young Grecian strangers, <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            during that space of time in which it was not lawful for <lb/>
            them to continue within the precincts of the temple; and <lb/>
            he now begged permission to resume the pledge entrusted <lb/>
            to his care.</p>
          <p>“ I wonder," replied Arsace, "that while you are praising <lb/>
            my kindness and humanity, you should at the same time <lb/>
            intimate a doubt of their continuance; and conceive any <lb/>
            apprehension that I shall not still be able and willing to <lb/>
            entertain these foreigners, and assign to them such honour <lb/>
            as is due."</p>
          <p>“ You mistake me," replied Thyamis; “ I know that they <lb/>
            would live here in much more splendour and affluence than <lb/>
            they can with me, even did they wish to remain under my <lb/>
            roof: but having met with many misfortunes, born of an <lb/>
            illustrious family, and now wandering here, far from their <lb/>
            native home ; the first wish of their hearts is, to recover their <lb/>
            friends, and to return to their country: my pledge to aid <lb/>
            them was the inheritance left me by my father; and I have, <lb/>
            too, myself many motives for friendship towards them."</p>
          <p>"You act discreetly," replied Arsace, " in asking as a <lb/>
            favour, rather than demanding as a right: for a favour it <lb/>
            would be in me to give up to your friendship, those over <lb/>
            whom I have a right as slaves.”-“Slaves!” cried Thyamis, <lb/>
            in amazement, “ what mean you ?”—“ I mean captives,” <lb/>
            said she, " by the right of war."</p>
          <p>Perceiving that she meant to insist upon their having <lb/>
            been taken by Mithranes, he thus resumed :—“ 0 Arsace! <lb/>
            it is not now war, but peace; if that brings servitude, this <lb/>
            restores liberty again; the one is the result of a tyrant's <lb/>
            will, the other is a truly royal gift. Besides, it is not the <lb/>
            mere name but the disposition of those using them, which <lb/>
            really constitute either pence or war. By attending to these <lb/>
            considerations you will define better wherein equity consists: <lb/>
            there can be no doubt as to what honour and expediency <lb/>
            demand in the present case. How can it be honourable, or <lb/>
            expedient, in you to persist obstinately in the detention of <lb/>
            these strangers, and to avow your determination of so <lb/>
            doing pIt</p>
          <p>Arsace could no longer contain herself; but acted, like <lb/>
            most who are in love, while they imagine their passion con­ <figure type="illustration">

              shame; concealment makes them timid, discovery audacious:” <lb/>
              she stood self-accused ; and she could not help perceiving, or <lb/>
              thinking she perceived, that Thyamis suspected her. Throw­ <lb/>
              ing aside therefore all reserve, and all regard to the dignity <lb/>
              of the high priest, she broke out on a sudden-“ Be assured <lb/>
              that you too shall answer for the share you have had in the <lb/>
              attack upon Mithranes; Oroondates will make a strict <lb/>
              inquiry after, and punish with severity, all those who were <lb/>
              concerned in the slaughter of him and of his troops. As <lb/>
              to these foreigners, I will not give them up; they are now <lb/>
              my slaves; shortly they will be sent, according to our <lb/>
              custom, to my brother, the Great King: declaim as you <lb/>
              please on what is decent, proper, and expedient; those in <lb/>

              gence of their own sovereign will.† Retire, then, from the <lb/>
              palace at once and willingly, lest you bo restrained against <lb/>
              your will."</p>
          <p>Thyamis retired, invoking the gods and predicting to her <lb/>
            no good event from such behaviour, and considering whether <lb/>
            he should disclose these proceedings to the citizens, and call <lb/>
            upon them for assistance.</p>
          <p>“ I value not your priesthood or your prophecy,” said <lb/>
            Arsace, " the only prophecy which love regards, is the pros­ <lb/>
            pect of success." So saying, she withdrew to her chamber, <lb/>
            and sending for Cybele, consulted with her upon the men­ <lb/>
            sures which she had next to pursue. She suspected the flight <lb/>
            of Achæmenes, and the motive of it; for Cybele, whenever <lb/>
            she was questioned on the subject, made various excuses for <lb/>
            his absence, and studiously endeavoured to persuade her <lb/>
            that he was anywhere else, rather than in the camp of Oroon­ <lb/>
            dates. These excuses, never wholly credited, became each <lb/>
            day less credible.</p>
          <p>When Cybele therefore approached her, she thus began: <lb/>
            “ What shall I do, nurse ? How can I ease the torments <lb/>
            which oppress me ? My love is as intense as ever; <note type="footnote">* ..... “ Nihil est audacius illis <lb/>

            nay, I think it burns more violently: but this youth, <lb/>
            so far from being softened by kindness and favours, be­ <lb/>
            comes more stubborn, and intractable. Some time ago <lb/>
            he could bring himself to soothe me by fallacious pro­ <lb/>
            mises, but now he seems openly and manifestly averse to my <lb/>
            desires: I fear he suspects, as I do, the cause of Achæ­ <lb/>
            menes<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign> absence, and that this has made him more timorous. <lb/>
            It is his disappearance, indeed, which gives me most uneasi­ <lb/>
            ness : I cannot help thinking that he is gone to Oroondates, <lb/>
            and perhaps will wholly or in part succeed in persuading <lb/>
            him of the truth of what he says. Could I but see Oroon­ <lb/>
            dates, he would not withstand one tear or caress of mine ; a <lb/>
            woman's well-known features exert a mighty magic over men.* <lb/>
            It will be a grievous thing, before I have enjoyed Theagenes, <lb/>
            to be informed against, nay, perhaps put to death, should his <lb/>
            mind be poisoned before I have the means of seeing and <lb/>
            conversing with him: wherefore, my dear Cybele, leave no <lb/>
            stone unturned, strain every engine ; you see how pressing <lb/>
            and critical the business now becomes; and lOll may well <lb/>
            believe that, if I myself am driven to despair, I shall not <lb/>
            easily spare others. You will be the first to rue the machi­ <lb/>
            nations of your son: and how you can be ignorant of them <lb/>
            I cannot conceive.”</p>
          <p>" The event," replied Cybele, "will prove the injustice of <lb/>
            your suspicions, both with regard to my son and me: but <lb/>
            when you arc yourself so supinet in the prosecution of your <lb/>
            love, why do you lay the fault on others? You are flatter­ <lb/>
            ing this youth like a slave, when you should command him <lb/>
            as a mistress. This indulgent mildness might be preper at <lb/>
            first, for fear of alarming his tender and inexperienced mind ; <lb/>
            but when kindness is ineffectual, assume a tone of more <lb/>
            severity; let punishments, and even stripes, force from him <lb/>
            that compliance which favours have failed in doing. It is <lb/>
            inborn in youth to despise those who court; to yield to those <lb/>
            who curb them: try this method and you will find him give <lb/>
            to force that which he refused to mildness.”</p>

          <p>"Again you are relapsing into your unseasonable tender­ <lb/>
            ness,” said Cybele; "a few turns of the rack will bring <lb/>
            about all you desire, and for a little uneasiness which you <lb/>
            may feel, you will soon obtain the full accomplishment of <lb/>
            your wishes. You may spare your eyes the pain of seeing <lb/>
            his sufferings—deliver him to the chief eunuch, Euphrates ; <lb/>
            order him to correct him, for some fault which you may <lb/>

            of compliance, you may free him from his restraint."</p>

            gave him directions for the purpose which had been sug­ <lb/>
            gested to her. He received them with a savage joy, rank­ <lb/>
            ling with the envy natural to his race,t and from what he <lb/>
            saw and suspected, particularly angry with Theagenes. lie <lb/>
            put him immediately in chains, cast him into a deep dun­ <lb/>
            geon, and punished him with hunger and stripes : keeping <lb/>
            all the while a sullen silence; answering none of the miserable <lb/>
            youth's inquiries, who pretended, (though he well knew the <lb/>
            cause), to be ignorant of the reason why he was thus hardly <lb/>
            treated. He increased his sufferings every day, far beyond <lb/>
            what Arsace knew of or commanded, permitting no one but <lb/>

            punishment from Oroondates, if Achæmenes should incau­ <lb/>
            tiously discover too much of the share she had in the <lb/>
            business; she feared lest her mistress should lay violent <lb/>
            hands upon herself, either stung by the disappointment, or <lb/>
            dreading the discovery of her amour. She determined, <lb/>
            therefore, to make a bold attempt, to avoid the danger <lb/>
            which awaited her, either by bringing about what Arsace <lb/>
            desired, or to remove all concerned in, and privy to the <lb/>
            matter, by involving them in one common destruction.</p>
          <p>Going therefore to the princess—“ We are losing our <lb/>
            labour," she said: " this stubborn youth, instead of being <lb/>
            softened, grows every day more self-willed ; he has Chariclea <lb/>
            continually in his mouth, and, by calling upon her alone, <lb/>
            consoles himself in his misfortunes. Let us then, as a last <lb/>
            experiment, cut the cable,! as the proverb says, and rid our­ <lb/>
            selves of this impediment to our wishes: perhaps, when he <lb/>
            shall hear that site is no more, he may despair of obtaining <lb/>
            her, and surrender himself to your desires."</p>
          <p>Arsace eagerly seized upon this idea: her rage and jea­ <lb/>
            lousy had but too well prepared her for embracing the cruel <lb/>
            expedient.—“You advise well," she replied, is 1 will take <lb/>
            care to have this wretch removed out of our way.”—“ But <lb/>
            who will you get to put your design into execution ?" said <lb/>
            Cybele, " for though your power here is great, the laws <note type="footnote"> * “ Justum et tenacem propositi virum. <lb/>
            * * * * * <lb/>

             <pb n="190"/>
            forbid you to put any one to death without the sentence of <lb/>
            the judges. You must undergo, therefore, some trouble <lb/>
            and delay in framing a fictitious charge against this maiden; <lb/>
            and there will, besides, be some difficulty in proving it. To <lb/>
            save you the pain and hazard of this proceeding, I am ready <lb/>
            to dare and suffer anything. I will, if you think fit, do the <lb/>
            deed with poison, and by means of a medicated cup remove <lb/>
            our adversary."</p>
          <p>Arsace approved, and bid her execute her purpose. She <lb/>
            lost no time, but went to the unhappy Chariclea, whom she <lb/>
            found in tears, and revolving how she could escape from life <lb/>
            of which she was now weary; suspecting as sibe did the suf­ <lb/>
            ferings and imprisonment of Theagenes, though Cybele had <lb/>
            endeavoured to conceal them from her, and had invented <lb/>
            various excuses for his unusual absence.</p>
          <p>The beldame thus addressed her:—“ Why will you con­ <lb/>
            sume yourself in continual, and now causeless, lamen­ <lb/>
            tations ? Theagenes is free, and will be with you here this <lb/>
            evening, His mistress, angry at some fault which he had <lb/>
            committed in her service, ordered him into a slight confine­ <lb/>
            ment, but has this day given directions for his release, in <lb/>
            honour of a feast which she is preparing to celebrate, and <lb/>
            iu compliance with my entreaties. Arise, therefore, cOIn. <lb/>
            pose yourself, and refresh your spirits with a slight refec­ <lb/>
            tion."</p>
          <p>" How shall I believe you ?" replied the afflicted maiden, <lb/>
            “ you have deceived me so often, that I know not how to <lb/>
            credit what you say."</p>
          <p>" I swear to you, by all the gods," said Cybele, " all your <lb/>
            troubles shall have an end this day; all your anxiety <lb/>
            shall be removed, only do not first kill yourself by ab­ <lb/>
            staining obstinately, as you do, from food. Taste, then, <lb/>
            the repast which I have provided."</p>
          <p>Chariclea was, with difficulty, persuaded, though she very <lb/>
            naturally entertained suspicions ; the protestations, however, <lb/>
            of the old woman, and the pleasing hopes suggested prevailed <lb/>
            at length ; (for what the mind desires it believes),* and they <lb/>
            sat down to the repast.</p>
          <p>Cybele motioned to Abra, the slave, who waited upon <lb/>
            them, to give the cup, after she had mixed the wine, first to <lb/>
            Chariclea; she then took another herself and drank. She <note type="footnote"> * “ Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought.”—Shakospoare. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            had not swallowed all that was presented to her, when she <lb/>
            appeared seized with dizziness; and throwing what remained <lb/>
            in the cup upon the ground, and casting a fierce look upon <lb/>
            the attendant, her body was attacked with violent spasms <lb/>
            and convulsions. Chariclea, and all who were in the room, <lb/>
            were struck with horror, and attempted to raise and assist <lb/>
            her; but the poison, potent enough to destroy a young and <lb/>
            vigorous person, wrought more quickly than can be ex­ <lb/>
            pressed upon her old and worn-out body. It seized the <lb/>
            vitals ; she was consumed by inward fire ; her limbs, which <lb/>
            were at first convulsed, became at length stiff and motion­ <lb/>
            loss, and a black colour spread itself over her skin. But <lb/>
            the malice of her soul was more malignant even than the <lb/>
            poison, and Cybele, even in death did not give over her <lb/>
            wicked arts; but by signs and broken accents, gave the <lb/>
            assistants to understand that site was poisoned by the con­ <lb/>
            trivance of Chariclea. No sooner did she expire than the <lb/>
            innocent maiden was bound, and carried before Arsace.</p>
          <p>When the princess asked her if she had prepared the <lb/>
            fatal draught, and threatened her, if the would not confess <lb/>
            the whole truth, that torments should force it from her, her <lb/>
            behaviour astonished all the beholders. She did not cast <lb/>
            down her eyes ; she betrayed no fear; she even smiled, and <lb/>
            treated the affair with scorn, disregarding, in conscious <lb/>
            innocence, the incredible accusation, and rejoicing in the <lb/>
            imputation of the guilt, if through the agency of others, it <lb/>
            should bring her to a death, which Theagenes had already <lb/>
            undergone. “If Theagenes be alive,” said she, "I am <lb/>
            totally guiltless of this crime ; but if he has fallen a victim <lb/>
            to your most virtuous practices, it needs no tortures to <lb/>
            extract a. confession from me : then am I the poisoner of <lb/>
            your incomparable nurse, treat me as if I were guilty, auJ <lb/>
            by taking my life, gratify him who loathed your unhallowed <lb/>
            wishes.”</p>
          <p>Arsace was stung into fury by this: she ordered her to <lb/>
            be smitten on the face, and then said—“ Take this wretch, <lb/>
            bound as site is, and shew her her precious lover suffering, <lb/>
            as he has well deserved ; then load every limb with fetters <lb/>
            and deliver her to Euphrates; bid him confine her in a <lb/>
            dungeon till to-morrow, when she will receive from the <lb/>
            Persian magistrates the sentence of death."</p>
          <p>While they were leading her away, the girl who had poured <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            out the wine at the fatal repast, who was an Ionian by <lb/>
            nation, and the same who was sent at first by Arsace to <lb/>
            wait upon her Grecian gnests—(whether out of compassion <lb/>
            for Chariclea, whom nobody could attend and not love, or <lb/>
            moved by a sudden impulse from heaven,) burst into tears, <lb/>
            and cried out—“0 most unhappy and guiltless maiden!" <lb/>
            The bystanders wondering at this exclamation and pressing <lb/>
            her to explain its meaning, she confessed that it was she <lb/>
            who had given the poison to Cybele, from whom sibe bad <lb/>
            received it, in order that it might be administered to Chari­ <lb/>
            clea. She declared, that either overcome by trepidation at <lb/>
            the enormity of the action, or confused at the signs made by <lb/>
            Cybele, to present the goblet first to the young stranger, <lb/>
            she had, in her hurry, changed the cups, and given that <lb/>
            containing the poison to the old woman.</p>
          <p>She was immediately taken before Arsace, every one <lb/>
            heartily wishing that Chariclea might be found innocent; <lb/>
            for beauty, and nobleness of demeanour, can move com­ <lb/>
            passion even in the minds of barbarians.</p>
          <p>The slave repeated before her mistress all she had said <lb/>
            before, but it was of no avail towards clearing the inno­ <lb/>
            cent maiden, and served only to involve herself in the same <lb/>
            punishment; for Arsace, saying she was an accomplice, <lb/>
            commanded her to be bound, thrown into prison, and <lb/>
            reserved with the other for trial ;and she sent directly <lb/>
            to the magistrates, who formed the Supreme Council; and <lb/>
            to whom it belonged to try criminals and to pronounce <lb/>
            their sentence, ordering them to assemble on the morrow.</p>
          <p>At the appointed time, when the court was met, Arsace <lb/>
            stated the case, and accused Chariclea of the poisoning; <lb/>
            lamenting, with many tears, the loss she had sustained in a <lb/>
            faithful and affectionate old servant, whom no treasures <lb/>
            could replace; calling the judges themselves to witness the <lb/>
            ingratitude with which she had been treated, in that, after <lb/>
            she had received and entertained the strangers with the <lb/>
            greatest kindness and humanity, she had met with such <lb/>
            a base return: in short, her tone was throughout bitter and <lb/>
            malignant.</p>
          <p>Chariclea made no defence, but confessed the crime, <lb/>
            admitting that she had administered the poison, and de­ <lb/>
            claring, that had she not been prevented, she would have <lb/>
            given another potion to Arsace; whom she attacked in good <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            set terms; provoking, in short, by every means in her <lb/>
            power, the sentence of the judges.</p>
          <p>This behaviour was the consequence of a plan concerted <lb/>
            between her and Theagenes the night before, in the prison, <lb/>
            whero they had agreed that she should voluntarily meet the <lb/>
            doom with which she was threatened, and quit a wandering <lb/>
            and wretched life, now become intolerable by the implacable <lb/>
            pursuits of adverse fortune. After which they took a last <lb/>
            melancholy embrace; and she bound about her body the <lb/>
            jewels which had been exposed with her, which she always <lb/>
            carried about her, concealing them under her garments to <lb/>
            serve as attendants upon her obsequies; and she now un­ <lb/>
            dauntedly avowed every crime which was laid to her charge, <lb/>
            and added others which her accusers had not thought of; so <lb/>
            that the judges, without any hesitation, were very near <lb/>
            awarding her the most cruel punishment, usual in such <lb/>
            cases, among the Persians.- At last, however, moved <lb/>
            perhaps by her youth, her beauty, and noble air, they cou­ <lb/>
            demned her to be burnt alive.</p>
          <p>She was dragged directly out of the court, and led by the <lb/>
            executioners without the walls, the crier proclaiming that a <lb/>
            prisoner was going to suffer for the crime of poisoning; and <lb/>
            a vast multitude flocking together, and following her, poured <lb/>
            out of the city.</p>
          <p>Among the spectators upon the walls Arsace had the <lb/>
            cruelty to present herself, that she might satiate her re­ <lb/>
            venge, and obtain a savage consolation for her disappoint­ <lb/>
            ment, in viewing the sufferings of her to whom she imputed <lb/>
            it. The ministers of justice now made ready and lighted an <lb/>
            immense pile; and were preparing to place the innocent <lb/>
            victim upon it, when she begged a delay of a few moments, <lb/>
            promising that she would herself voluntarily ascend it-and <lb/>
            now turning towards the rising sun, and lifting up her eyes <lb/>
            and hands to heaven, she exclaimed—“0 sun! 0 earth! <lb/>
            0 celestial and infernal deities who view and punish the <lb/>
            actions of the wicked! I call upon you to witness how in­ <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch thus describes the punishment of poisoners among the <lb/>
            Persians.—“ Poisoners are put to death, by the Persian laws, in the <lb/>
            following manner. The head of the criminal is laid upon a flat stone, <lb/>
            the executioner with another stone beats and pounds his head, until <lb/>
            both head and face are entirely crushed.” </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            nocent I am of the crime of which I am accused. Receive <lb/>
            me propitiously, who am now preparing to undergo a volun­ <lb/>
            tary death, unable to support any longer the cruel and un­ <lb/>
            relenting attacks of adverse fortune;—but may your speedy <lb/>
            vengeance overtake that worker of evil, the accursed and <lb/>
            adulterous Arsace; the disappointment of whose profligate <lb/>
            designs upon Theagenes has urged her thus to wreak her <lb/>
            fury upon me.” This appeal, and these protestations, caused <lb/>
            a murmur in the assembly. Some said the matter ought to <lb/>
            undergo a further examination—some wished to hinder, <lb/>
            others advanced to prevent her mounting the pile: but sho <lb/>
            put them all aside, and ascended it intrepidly.</p>
          <p>She placed herself in the midst of it, and remained for a <lb/>
            considerable time unhurt, the flames playing harmlessly <lb/>
            around her, rather than approaching her ; not injuring her <lb/>
            in the least-but receding withersoever she turned herself; <lb/>
            so that their only effect seemed to be to give light and <lb/>
            splendour to her charms; as she lay like a bride upon a fiery <lb/>
            nuptial couch.</p>
          <p>She shifted herself from one side of the pile to another, <lb/>
            marvelling as much as any one else, at what happened, and <lb/>
            seeking for destruction, but still without effect; for the fire <lb/>
            ever retreated, and seemed to shun her approach. The exe­ <lb/>
            cutioners on their part were not idle, but threw on more <lb/>
            fuel (Arsace by signs inciting them), dry wood, and reeds, <lb/>
            and every thing that was likely to raise and feed the flame; <lb/>
            yet all was to no purpose; and now a murmur growing into <lb/>
            a tumult, began to run through the assembly: they cried <lb/>
            out—“This is a divine interposition !-the maiden is un­ <lb/>
            justly accused!—she is surely innocent !-and advancing <lb/>
            towards the pile, they drove away the ministers of justice, <lb/>
            Thyamis, whom the uproar had roused from his retirement, <lb/>
            now appearing at their head, and calling on the people for <lb/>
            assistance. They were eager to deliver Chariclea, but durst <lb/>
            not approach too near. They earnestly desired her, therefore, <lb/>
            to come down herself from the pile ; for there could be no <lb/>
            danger in passing through the flames, to one who appeared <lb/>
            even to be untouched by them. Chariclea seeing and hear­ <lb/>
            ing this, and believing too that some divinity was really <lb/>
            interposing to preserve her, deemed that she ought not to <lb/>
            appear ungrateful, or reject the mercy, and leapt lightly <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            from the pile: at which sight the whole city raised a sudden <lb/>
            shout of wonder, joy, and thanksgiving to the gods.</p>
          <p>Arsace, too, beheld this prodigy with astonishment, but <lb/>
            with very different sensations. She could not contain her <lb/>
            rage. She left the ramparts, hurried through a postern <lb/>
            gate, attended by her guards and the Persian nobles, and <lb/>
            herself laid violent hands on Chariclea. Casting a furious <lb/>
            glance at the people-" Are ye not ashamed," she cried, "to <lb/>
            assist in withdrawing from punishment a wretched creature <lb/>
            detected in the very fact of poisoning, and confessing it ? <lb/>
            Do ye not consider, that while shewing a blameable com­ <lb/>
            passion to this wicked woman, ye are putting yourselves in <lb/>
            opposition to the laws of the Persians-to the judges, the <lb/>
            peers, the viceroys, and to the Great King himself. The <lb/>
            fact of her not burning has perhaps moved you, and ye at­ <lb/>
            tribute it to the interposition of the gods, not considering <lb/>
            that this yet more fully proves her guilt. Such is her <lb/>
            knowledge of charms, and witcheraft, that she is enabled to <lb/>
            resist even the force of fire. Come all of you to-morrow <lb/>
            to the examination which shall be held in public, and you <lb/>
            shall not only hear her confess her crimes herself, but shall <lb/>
            find her convicted also by her accomplices whom I have in <lb/>
            custody."</p>
          <p>She then commanded Chariclea to be led away, still <lb/>
            keeping her hold upon her neck, and ordering her guards <lb/>
            to disperse the crowd, who were with difficulty prevented <lb/>
            from interfering for her rescue; but who at length gave <lb/>
            way, partly suspecting her to be a sorceress, and partly <lb/>
            through awe of the person, and dreading the power, of <lb/>
            Arsace.</p>
          <p>Chariclea then was again committed to the custody of <lb/>
            Euphrates; again thrown into prison, and reserved for a <lb/>
            second trial, and a second sentence; rejoicing however <lb/>
            amidst her troubles, that she should once more have an op­ <lb/>
            portunity of seeing, and conversing with, Theagenes; for <lb/>
            Arsace, out of a refinement of cruelty, had ordered them <lb/>
            to be confined in one dungeon, that each might be a specta­ <lb/>
            tor of the other's sufferings; for she well knew that a <lb/>
            tender heart is much more hurt by the pains of those it <lb/>
            loves than by its own. In this instance, however, her savage <lb/>
            mind was disappointed; and what she meant as a punish­ <note type="footnote"> o 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            ment turned out a consolation. They took a melancholy <lb/>
            pleasure Had in suffering for each other, and in suffering equally. <lb/>
            Hada greater share of torments been inflicted upon either, <lb/>
            the other would have been jealous, and thought his love de­ <lb/>
            frauded—moreover they were now together-they could con­ <lb/>
            verse with, comfort, and encourage one another to bear their <lb/>
            calamities with fortitude, and to resist courageously every <lb/>
            trial that might endanger their purity or fidelity. They <lb/>
            passed the greatest part of the night in speaking on such <lb/>
            topics, as might indeed be expected from a pair, whose <lb/>
            whole delight was in their mutual conversation, and who <lb/>
            despaired of ever passing another night together again.</p>
          <p>At length they came to the miraculous event which hap­ <lb/>
            pened at the pyre. Theagenes attributed it to the benevo­ <lb/>
            lence of the gods, who were angry at the injustice of Arsace, <lb/>
            and who pitied Chariclea's innocence and piety. She her­ <lb/>
            self was in doubt whether to thank or complain of heaven. <lb/>
            The manifest interposition of the gods at the place of ex­ <lb/>
            ecution, was a mark of their kindness and protection ; but <lb/>
            to be preserved from death, only to be plunged afresh in <lb/>
            new and unceasing troubles, was rather a sign of their hav­ <lb/>
            ing incurred, and still continuing under, the divine dis­ <lb/>
            pleasure: unless indeed, it were some wonder-working <lb/>
            method of the deity delighting to plunge them into the <lb/>
            deepest misery, in order to shew its power of saving them <lb/>
            when their condition appeared desperate.</p>
          <p>She was going on in a complaining style, when Theagenes <lb/>
            stopped her, bidding her speak more reverently, nor to <lb/>
            scrutinize the conduct of the Deity. Suddenly she ex­ <lb/>
            claimed,—“ May the gods be propitious to us, for I just <lb/>
            now call to mind a dream, (or rather waking vision), which <lb/>
            I had last night, and which the unexpected sight of you <lb/>
            again, and the various matters which we have since talked <lb/>
            of, had driven from my memory. The vision was this :- <lb/>
            The beatified Calasiris appeared to me (whether in reality <lb/>
            or in idea, I am not certain) and repeated these lines, for <lb/>
            the words fell into verse; <note type="footnote"> .<unclear>earing</unclear> Pantarbè, fear not flames, fair maid, </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> Fate. to whom nought is hard, shall bring thee aid.' *</note> <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="197"/>
              Theagenes on his part appeared suddenly like one under <lb/>
              supernatural impulse, for springing forwards, as far as his <lb/>
              fetters would permit him, be exclaimed—“ The gods be. <lb/>
              gracious to us ! recollection makes me also a poet; I had, <lb/>
              myself, a like vision. Calasiris, or some deity in his shape <lb/>
              appeared to me, and addressed me in these lines: <lb/>
              ‘From Arsace, the morrow sees thee free- <lb/>
              To .Ethiopia with the virgin flee.’*</p>
          <p>Now, I readily comprehend the meaning of the oracle <lb/>
            which is given to me. By Æthiopia, is signified the dark <lb/>
            abode of those who dwell under the earth—by the virgin, <lb/>
            Proserpine—by freedom, my release from this wretched <lb/>
            body: but I do not so readily understand that which relates <lb/>
            to you—there appears to be a contradiction in it. The <lb/>
            name of Pantarbè means ‘ all fear,' and yet from it you are <lb/>
            promised assistance."</p>
          <p>" My dearest Theagenes,” replied Charielea, “ you have <lb/>
            been so accustomed to misfortunes that you use yourself to <lb/>
            interpret every thing in its worst sense-the mind of man <lb/>
            so readily takes a colour from its circumstances. The <lb/>
            oracles appear to me to admit of much more favourable <lb/>
            meaning. The virgin, instead of Proserpine, means perhaps <lb/>
            me, with whom you are to escape to Ethiopia, my country, <lb/>
            after you shall have been delivered from the prisons of <lb/>
            Arsace. How all this is to be brought about is not very <lb/>
            apparent, but it is not incredible. Every thing is possible <lb/>
            to the gods ; and they who have favoured us with this pre­ <lb/>
            diction, will watch over its accomplishment. The prophecy <lb/>
            which relates to me, so far from being obscure, is, as you <lb/>
            see, fulfilled; and I aID, contrary to all expectation, alive, <lb/>
            and unhurt, at least by the flames :I was hitherto ignorant <lb/>
            that I carried the cause of my preservation about me, but <lb/>
            now I fancy that I understand the words. I took particular <lb/>
            care at the time of my trial, as indeed I had been wont to <lb/>
            do before, to have the jewels which were exposed with <lb/>
            me, bound closely about my body, concealing them <lb/>
            under my garments—in case I should escape, they would <lb/>
            help to support my life-if I were doomed to suffer, they <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig36.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="198"/>
              would adorn my funeral. Among these, which consist of <lb/>
              costly necklaces, and Indian and Ethiopian jewels, there is <lb/>
              a ring, given by my father to my mother when they were <lb/>
              betrothed : within the bezil is a stone called Pantarbè ; it is <lb/>
              inscribed with sacred letters, and endowed with mystic <lb/>
              virtues, from whence, as I conjecture, it obtains the power to <lb/>
              preserve those who wear it from the force of fire. This, <lb/>
              therefore, most probably, and the good pleasure of the <lb/>
              gods, is what has preserved me. I remember too, that our <lb/>
              friend, Calasiris, (now in happiness,) told me that some­ <lb/>
              thing of this virtue was hinted at in the writing inscribed <lb/>
              on the fillet which was exposed with me, and which I always <lb/>
              wear round my waist.”</p>
          <p>“What you say," replied Theagenes, " may perhaps be <lb/>
            true—what has happened seems to confirm your conjecture: <lb/>
            but what Pantarbè will deliver us from the dangers which <lb/>
            threaten us to-morrow? This stone, though it preserves <lb/>
            from fire, does not confer immortality, and the wicked <lb/>
            Arsace will find out some other, and new kind of punish­ <lb/>
            ment. How do I wish that the would involve us both in <lb/>
            the same sentence, that one and the same hour might end <lb/>
            our troubles! I should not esteem such a departure death, <lb/>
            but repose and ease to our manifold miseries.”</p>
          <p>,. Be not so cast down, said Chariclea, " the oracle pro­ <lb/>
            mises us another Pantarbè. Let us trust in the gods, so <lb/>
            will our deliverance be more grateful; or, if we be doomed <lb/>
            to die, piety will soften and sanctify our sufferings.”</p>
          <p>In such conversations were the unfortunate lovers em­ <lb/>
            ployed ; each more solicitous for the fate which awaited the <lb/>
            other, than for his own; They vowed to be faithful, and <lb/>
            love one another till death; and beguiled the melancholy <lb/>
            moments in these, which they thought would be their last, <lb/>
            protestations. Meanwhile Bagoas and his troop of horso <lb/>
            arrived at Memphis, in the middle of the night, while every <lb/>
            one was buried in sleep. And when they had, without <lb/>
            tumult, roused the guards, and made known who they were, <lb/>
            they were admitted and entered into the court of the Vice­ <lb/>
            roy's palace. Bagoas caused his men to surround the <lb/>
            building, that he might be prepared, in case of meeting <lb/>
            with any resistance; and he himself gaining admission by a <lb/>
            crazy postern gate, and commanding silence to the person <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            there, hastened, with ease, from his knowledge of the place, <lb/>
            to the apartments of Euphrates, the moon affording a little <lb/>
            light. Euphrates was in bed; but being roused by the <lb/>
            noise made at his door, started up, and called out " Who is <lb/>
            there P " " It is I," said Bagoas; " make no noise, but <lb/>
            order a light to be brought.”—The other ordered a boy, who <lb/>
            slept in his chamber, to bring a light, but to take care not <lb/>
            to awaken any one else.</p>
          <p>When the light came, and the boy had retired, Euphrates <lb/>
            began—“ What new calamity does this sudden and unex­ <lb/>
            pected appearance of yours announce ? ”—“ There is no <lb/>
            need,” returned the other, “ of many words; take and read <lb/>
            this letter. Recognise the seal of Oroondates, and obey his <lb/>
            commands, this very night, with secrecy and expedition. <lb/>
            Make use of the soldiers whom I have brought with me, <lb/>
            that you may give the less alarm. I leave you to judge for <lb/>
            yourself whether you will or will not first disclose the <lb/>
            business to Arsace."</p>
          <p>Euphrates took the letters, and perused them both­ <lb/>
            "This," says he, It will be a fresh blow to my mistress, and <lb/>
            she needs no additional affliction; for she was yesterday <lb/>
            seized with a sudden disorder, as if by a stroke from <lb/>
            heaven, and she now lies in a burning fever, and is in the <lb/>
            utmost danger of her life. As for these letters, I would <lb/>
            not show them to her at present, even were she in good <lb/>
            health, for I know that she would sooner die herself, and <lb/>
            involve us in the same destruction, than part with these <lb/>
            young people. You are arrived just in time to save them <lb/>
            Come then forthwith-receive those whom you seek-take <lb/>
            them away-use them kindly yourself, and endeavour to <lb/>
            procure for them the same treatment from others. Their <lb/>
            situation may well excite your compassion; for I have been <lb/>
            obliged, much against my will, but at the inexorable com­ <lb/>
            mand of Arsace, to inflict upon them a variety of punish­ <lb/>
            ments and tortures. They seem, besides, to be well born, <lb/>
            and, to judge from their habitual conduct, possessed of dis­ <lb/>
            cretion and good sense." And so saying, he rose and <lb/>
            conducted Bagoas to the prison, who, as soon as he saw the <lb/>
            young captives, pale and exhausted as they were with their <lb/>
            sufferings, he could not help being wonderfully struck with <lb/>
            their form and beauty. They, concluding that this unsea­ <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            sonable visit announced their fate, and that Bagoas was <lb/>
            come to lead one of them, at least, to trial and execution, <lb/>
            were at first rather agitated; but soon recovering an air of <lb/>
            cheerfulness, they appeared pleased rather than grieved.</p>
          <p>Euphrates advanced; and as he was preparing to loose. <lb/>
            their fetters from the wooden block, Theagenes exclaimed, <lb/>
            " Accursed Arsace! She hopes to conceal her abominable <lb/>
            actions in darkness and obscurity. But let her know that <lb/>
            the eye of justice is most piercing; that it will bring to light <lb/>
            her most secret crimes and display her wickedness in the face <lb/>
            of the sun. But do you, ministers of her cruelty, execute <lb/>
            her commands. Grant us, however, one last and only <lb/>
            favour: whether we be doomed to die by fire, by water, or <lb/>
            by the sword, let us suffer together, and end our wretched <lb/>
            being by one and the same kind of death." Chariclea <lb/>
            joined in this supplication. The eunuchs, who understood <lb/>
            what they said, shed tears, and brought them out in chains <lb/>
            as they were.</p>
          <p>When they had left the palace, Euphrates remained <lb/>
            where he was ;and Bagoas, ordering his followers to take <lb/>
            off all their fetters, except, such as were just necessary to <lb/>
            prevent an escape, placed them on horseback, surrounded <lb/>
            with his troop, and took, with all expedition, the road to <lb/>
            Thebes.</p>
          <p>They rode all that night, and the next day till nine <lb/>
            o'clock, when, being spent with want of sleep, and exposed <lb/>
            to the summer rays of an Egyptian sun, Chariclea particu­ <lb/>
            larly, unused to this kind of travelling, being nearly ex­ <lb/>
            hausted with fatigue, they resolved, at last, to make a halt, <lb/>
            to breathe their horses, and to refresh themselves. They <lb/>
            chose for this purpose an elevated and projecting place on <lb/>
            the banks of the Nile, where the river, turning from its <lb/>
            direct course, and winding into a semicircle, forms a spot <lb/>
            something resembling the gulf of Epirus, which, being <lb/>
            kept continually moist, abounded in grass and herbage proper <lb/>
            for their beasts. Here, too, were peach trees, sycamores, <lb/>
            and others which love to grow in the neighbourhood of the <lb/>
            Nile, these over-arched and afforded them a pleasant shade. <lb/>
            Bagoas availed himself of their shelter instead of tents, and <lb/>
            here he took some refreshment, inviting Theagenes and <lb/>
            Chariclea to partake of his repast. They refused at first; <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            he pressed them; and when they replied that it was need. <lb/>
            less for those who were going to execution to trouble them. <lb/>
            selves about nourishment, he told them they were much <lb/>
            mistaken if they thought their lives in any danger; for he <lb/>
            was not leading them to death, but to the viceroy Oroondates.</p>
          <p>The meridian heat of the sun had now passed; it was no <lb/>
            longer vertical, but its beams struck upon them laterally. <lb/>
            Bagoas thereupon prepared to pursue his march, when a <lb/>
            courier arrived with great precipitation, himself out of <lb/>
            breath, and his horse dropping with sweat, and ready to <lb/>
            sink under hint with fatigue. As soon as lie had spoken <lb/>
            a word to Bagoas in private, he remained in silence. The <lb/>
            eunuch fixing for some time his eyes on the ground, with <lb/>
            a serious and reflecting air, at last said, “Rejoice, strangers! <lb/>
            You are revenged of your enemy. Arsace is no more. As <lb/>
            soon as she heard that you were gone away with me, she <lb/>
            strangled herself, and has prevented an inflicted, by a <lb/>
            voluntary, death; for her crimes have been such, that she <lb/>
            had no hope of escaping the just resentment of Oroondates <lb/>
            and the sentence of the Great King, and must either have <lb/>
            lost her life, or have spent the remainder of it in infamy <lb/>
            and confinement. Be of good cheer, then; fear nothing; <lb/>
            I know your innocence, and your persecutor is removed."</p>
          <p>Bagoas said this as he stood near them, with difficulty . <lb/>
            expressing himself in the Greek tongue, and using many <lb/>
            uncouth words; but he spoke with sincerity of heart, for <lb/>
            he rejoiced at the death of Arsace, whose dissolute manners <lb/>
            and tyrannical disposition he abominated; and he wished <lb/>
            to comfort and encourage the young people; he thought <lb/>
            moreover that he should recommend himself to Oroondates <lb/>
            by a very acceptable service, by preserving for hint this <lb/>
            young his man, who would throw into the shade all the rest of <lb/>
            his attendants ;and by presenting him with a maiden <lb/>
            worthy in every respect to supply the place of Arsace.</p>
          <p>Theagenes and Chariclea, too, rejoiced at this intelli­ <lb/>
            gence. They adored the justice of the gods; and felt that, <lb/>
            after this sudden and deserved end of their enemy, they <lb/>
            should not feel their misfortunes, however severe—so wel­ <lb/>
            come is death to some if only it be shared in by their foes. <lb/>
            Evening now approached. A refreshing breeze sprang up, <lb/>
            and invited them to continue their journey. They travelled <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            all that night, and part of the next morning, making al <lb/>
            possible dates expedition to Thebes, in hopes of finding Oroon­ <lb/>
            datesthere. In this hope, however, Bagoas was disap­ <lb/>
            pointed. Before he arrived at that city, a courier met him, <lb/>
            nnd informed him that Oroondates had set out for Syene, <lb/>
            leaving the strictest orders to his officers to collect every <lb/>
            man, even from the garrisons, and march them after him <lb/>
            to that place; for the greatest apprehensions were enter­ <lb/>
            tained that the town would be taken before the satrap <lb/>
            could arrive to its succour, the Æthiopian army having <lb/>
            appeared at its gates before any intelligence was received <lb/>
            that it was in motion. Bagons, therefore, turned out of <lb/>
            the road to Thebes, and took that of Syene.</p>
          <p>When he came near the place, he fell in with a troop of <lb/>
            Æthiopians, who had been sent out to scour the country, <lb/>
            and to ascertain the safety of the roads for the march of <lb/>
            their own army. Overtaken by night, and ignorant of the <lb/>
            ground, they had concealed themselves behind some bushes <lb/>
            (in obedience to the orders given them), watching for the <lb/>
            passing by of any prey which they might seize, and also <lb/>
            providing for their own security. At break of day they <lb/>
            perceived the approach of Bagoas and his company. They <lb/>
            despised the smallness of their number, but let them all <lb/>
            pass by, in order to assure themselves that there was no <lb/>
            greater force behind; and then suddenly rushing from their <lb/>
            concealment in the marsh, they pursued and attacked them <lb/>
            with a great shout.</p>
          <p>Bagoas and his men, astonished at the sudden noise and <lb/>
            assault, seeing from their colour that they were Ethiopians, <lb/>
            and from their number (which amounted to near a thou­ <lb/>
            sand light-armed men), that resistance was vain, did not <lb/>
            await their approach, but took to flight. They retreated at <lb/>
            first with some degree of order, to avoid the appearance of <lb/>
            a complete rout. The enemy detached after them a bard <lb/>
            of two hundred Troglodites. The Troglodites are a pastoral <lb/>
            nation, on the borders of Arabia, of great natural agility, <lb/>
            which they increase by exercise.. They are unused to heavy <note type="footnote"> * Herodotus gives the same account of the swiftness of this race, <lb/>

            whom, if they find them superior, they immediately retreat. <lb/>
            The enemy do not take the trouble to pursue them, knowing <lb/>
            them to be swift as the wind, and given to hide themselves <lb/>
            in caverns, which they make their habitations. They, <lb/>
            though on foot, soon overtook Bagoas and his flying <lb/>
            squadron, and making use of their slings, wounded some <lb/>
            of them from afar, yet, on their facing about, did not await <lb/>
            their assault, but retreated headlong to their own comrades.</p>
          <p>The Persians seeing this, and perceiving the smallness of <lb/>
            their number, ventured to attack them; and having easily <lb/>
            repulsed them for a space, turned again, and putting spurs <lb/>
            to their horses, continued their flight with slackened rein <lb/>
            and with the utmost speed. Some, deserting the main <lb/>
            body, and hurrying to a bend in the Nile, hid themselves <lb/>
            under its banks. The horse of Bagoas fell with him; one <lb/>
            of his legs was fractured with the fall, and being unable to <lb/>
            move, he was taken prisoner.</p>
          <p>Theagenes and Chariclea, too, were made captives. They <lb/>
            thought it dishonourable to desert Bagoas, who had shown <lb/>
            them much kindness, and from whom they hoped more in <lb/>
            future. They kept, therefore, by his side, dismounting from <lb/>
            their horses, and voluntarily offered themselves to the enemy; <lb/>
            Theagenes saying to Chariclea, "This explains my dream: <lb/>
            these are the Æthiopians into whose lands wo are fated to <lb/>
            go: let us give ourselves up into their hands, and await an <lb/>
            uncertain fortune with them, rather than expose ourselves <lb/>
            to manifest danger with Oroondates."</p>
          <p>Chariclea thought she could now perceive herself to be <lb/>
            led on by the hand of destiny: a secret hope of better <lb/>
            fortune began to insinuate itself into her bosom, and she <lb/>
            could not help considering those who attacked them as <lb/>
            friends rather than enemies; but not venturing to disclose <lb/>
            her presages to Theagenes, she contented herself with <lb/>
            expressing her consent to his advice.</p>
          <p>When the Æthiopians approached, and observed Bagoas, <lb/>
            from his features, to be a eunuch, and incapable of resist­ <lb/>
            ance, and the others unarmed and in chains, but of extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary grace and beauty, they inquired who they were. They <lb/>
            made use of an Egyptian interpreter, whom they carried with <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            them, who understood besides a little Persian, concluding <lb/>
            that the prisoners spoke one or other of these tongues; for <lb/>
            experience had taught them that a body detached as spies <lb/>
            and scouts ought always to have some one with them who <lb/>
            naturally speaks or understands the language of the country <lb/>
            which they are sent to reconnoitre.</p>
          <p>Theagenes, who, from his long residence in the land, had <lb/>
            acquired something of the Egyptian tongue, replied, that <lb/>
            the eunuch was one of the chief officers of the Persian <lb/>
            viceroy; that he himself and Chariclea were Grecians by <lb/>
            birth, taken prisoners, first by the Persians, and now volun­ <lb/>
            tary captives to the Æthiopians, as they hoped, under better <lb/>
            auspices.</p>
          <p>The enemy determined to spare their lives, and to deliver <lb/>
            them, as the first fruits of victory, to their sovereign, looking <lb/>
            upon them as amongst the most valuable possessions of <lb/>
            the satrap ; eunucbs are reckoned as the eyes and ears of <lb/>
            a Persian court, having neither children nor connexions <lb/>
            to turn aside their fidelity, they are wholly attached to the <lb/>
            person and service of their master;* their young prisoners, <lb/>
            too, appeared to them to be the most beautiful persons <lb/>
            they had ever seen, and promised to be conspicuous orna­ <lb/>
            ments to the royal household. They mounted them, there­ <lb/>
            fore, upon horses, and carried them along with them, <lb/>
            though the accident of Bagoas, and the fetters of the <lb/>
            others, prevented their travelling very fast.</p>
          <p>Here, then, was a kind of prologue to another drama :­ <lb/>
            just before they were prisoners in a foreign land, and on <lb/>
            the verge of being brought out to a public and ignominious <lb/>
            execution ; now they were being carried, or rather escorted, <lb/>
            though in captive guise, by those destined, ere long, to be <lb/>
            their subjects. Such was their present situation. <note type="footnote"> * See Xeu. Cyrop. vii. 5. 60, </note> <pb n="205"/>

          <p>SYENE was now closely blockaded, and on every side, as <lb/>
            with a net, invested by the Æthiopian army.</p>
          <p>Oroondates, as soon as he was informed of the design and <lb/>
            sudden approach of the enemy (who, having passed the <lb/>
            ataracts, were pressing towards the place), using the <lb/>
            utmost diligence and expedition, had contrived to throw <lb/>
            himself into the city before their arrival; and after <lb/>
            planting his engines and artillery upon the walls, awaited <lb/>
            the attack, and made every preparation for a vigorous <lb/>
            defence.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes, the king of Æthiopia, though be was deceived <lb/>
            in the hope of surprising the town before they had any <lb/>
            notice of his approach, invested it, however, on all sides, <lb/>
            and surrounding it with a line of circumvallation, made for <lb/>
            the present no attack, but sat down quietly before it, filling <lb/>
            and exhausting the plains of Syene with myriads of men, <lb/>
            beasts, and cattle. Here the party which has been men­ <lb/>
            tioned brought their captives into his presence.</p>
          <p>He was delighted at the sight of the young people; his <lb/>
            soul, by a secret prescient movement, of which he knew not <lb/>
            the cause, inclining towards his children. He thought this <lb/>
            too an omen of victory, and joyfully exclaimed—" See! the <lb/>
            gods, as our first spoils, deliver up to us our enemies in <lb/>
            bonds. Let these then, as our first captives, be carefully <lb/>
            preserved for our triumphant sacrifices to be oilered, as the <lb/>
            customs of Æthiopia require, to the gods of our country, <lb/>
            when we shall have subdued our foes." And having praised <lb/>
            and rewarded the captors, he sent them, together with their <lb/>
            prisoners, to the rear of the army, ordering the latter to <lb/>
            be kept under a guard (many of whom understood their <lb/>
            language), to be treated, attended, and provided for in <lb/>
            the most careful and splendid manner, and especially <lb/>
            to be preserved from all contamination, as destined to be <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            sacred victims. He directed their iron chains to be taken <lb/>
            off, and fetters of gold to be put on in their room—for this <lb/>
            metal is used by the Æthiopians in the way in which other <lb/>
            nations use iron. His commands were obeyed; and the <lb/>
            lovers, when they saw their first chains taken off, began to <lb/>
            entertain hopes of liberty, which were soon crushed by the <lb/>
            appearance and application of the golden ones.</p>
          <p>Theagenes could not forbear smiling, and exclaimed <lb/>
            " Here is, indeed, a splendid mutation of fortune; the god­ <lb/>
            dess is very kind to us, and changes our iron for gold: <lb/>
            enriched by our fetters, we are become prisoners of high <lb/>
            price."</p>
          <p>Chariclea smiled at this sally, and tried to keep up <lb/>
            his spirits, insisting that the more favourable predictions of <lb/>
            the gods were beginning to be fulfilled, and endeavouring <lb/>
            to soothe his mind with better hopes.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes, who had flattered himself that he should <lb/>
            take Syene at his first appearance, without opposition, <lb/>
            being very nearly repulsed by the garrison, defending <lb/>
            themselves bravely, irritated besides by insulting speeches, <lb/>
            determined no longer to continue the blockade, by which, <lb/>
            the city might at last be taken, to the destruction of some <lb/>
            and the escape of others: but, by a new and unusual way <lb/>
            of assault, to involve the town, and its defenders, in one <lb/>
            common and universal ruin.</p>
          <p>His plan of attack was this: he described a circle round <lb/>
            the walls, which he divided into portions of ten cubits each, <lb/>
            assigning ten men to every division, and ordering them to <lb/>
            dig a wide and deep ditch. They dug it accordingly, while <lb/>
            others, with the earth they threw out, raised a mound or wall <lb/>
            parallel with, and nearly equal in height, to that of the place <lb/>
            which they were besieging. The garrison made no attempt to <lb/>
            hinder these operations—the besieging army was so nume­ <lb/>
            rous, that they durst not venture on a sally—and the works <lb/>
            were carried on at such a distance from the walls, as to be <lb/>
            out of the reach of their missile weapons.</p>
          <p>When he had completed this part of his plan, with <lb/>
            wonderful dispatch, owing to the multitude of men em­ <lb/>
            ployed in it, and the diligence with which he urged on their <lb/>
            labours, he proceeded to execute another work. He left a <lb/>
            part of the circle, to the space of about fifty feet, plain and <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            unfilled up. From each extremity of the ditch above de­ <lb/>
            scribed, be extended a long mound down to the Nile, raising <lb/>
            it higher and higher as it approached the river. It had the <lb/>
            appearance of two long walls, preserving all the way the <lb/>
            breadth of fifty feet.</p>
          <p>When he had carried on his lines so that they joined the <lb/>
            river, he cut a passage for it. and poured its waters into the <lb/>
            channel, which he had provided for them. They, rushing <lb/>
            from higher into lower ground, and from the vast width of the <lb/>
            Nile into the narrow channel, and confined by the mounds <lb/>
            on each side, thundered through the passage and channel <lb/>
            with a noise and impetuosity that might be heard at a great <lb/>
            distance.</p>
          <p>The fearful sight and sound struck the ears and met the <lb/>
            eyes of the astonished inhabitants of Syene. They saw the <lb/>
            alarming circumstances in which they were, and that the <lb/>
            view of the besiegers was, to overwhelm them with the waters. <lb/>
            The trenches which surrounded, and the inundation which <lb/>
            was now fast approaching, prevented their escaping out <lb/>
            of the city, and it was impossible for them to remain long <lb/>
            in it, without the extremest danger; they took measures, <lb/>
            therefore, as well as they were able, for their own pro­ <lb/>
            tection.</p>
          <p>In the first place, they filled up and secured every opening <lb/>
            and crevice in the gates with pitch and tow; then they <lb/>
            propped and strengthened the walls with earth, stones, and <lb/>
            wood, heaping up against them anything which was at hand. <lb/>
            Every one was employed; women, children, and old men; <lb/>
            for no age, no sex, ever refuses labour when it is for the <lb/>
            preservation of their lives. They who were best able to <lb/>
            bear fatigue were employed in digging a subterraneous and <lb/>
            narrow passage, from the city to the enemy's mound, which <lb/>
            work was thus conducted:</p>
          <p>They first sunk a shaft near the walls, to the depth of <lb/>
            five cubits; and when they had dug it below the founda­ <lb/>
            tions, they carried their mine on forwards towards the <lb/>
            bulwarks with which they wore inclosed, working by torch­ <lb/>
            light; those who were behind receiving, in regular order, <lb/>
            the earth thrown out from those who were before, and de­ <lb/>
            positing it at length in a vacant place in the city, formerly <lb/>
            occupied by gardens, where they raised it into a heap.</p><pb n="208"/>
            
          <p>Their intention in these operations, was to give some vent <lb/>
            and outlet to the waters, in case they should reach the city; <lb/>
            but the approach of the calamities which threatened them <lb/>
            was too speedy for their endeavours to prevent it. The <lb/>
            Nile, rolling through the channel which bad been prepared <lb/>
            for it, soon reached the trench, overflowed it everywhere, <lb/>
            and formed a lake of the whole space between the dyke and <lb/>
            the walls; so that an inland town seemed like an island in <lb/>
            the midst of the sea, beaten and dashed against on all sides <lb/>
            by the waves.</p>
          <p>At first, and for the space of a day, the strength of the <lb/>
            walls resisted; but the continued pressure of the waters, <lb/>
            which were now raised to a great height, and penetrated <lb/>
            deeply into an earth black and slimy, which was cleft <lb/>
            in many places, from the summers heat, sensibly under­ <lb/>
            mined the walls; the bottom yielded to the pressure of the <lb/>
            top, and wherever, owing to the fissures in the ground, a <lb/>
            settlement took place, there the walls began to totter in <lb/>
            several places, menacing a downfall, while they who should <lb/>
            have defended the towers were driven from their stations <lb/>
            by the oscillation.</p>
          <p>Towards evening a considerable portion of the wall <lb/>
            between the towers fell down; not so much, however, as <lb/>
            to be even with the ground, and afford a passage to the <lb/>
            waters, for it was still about five cubits above them; but <lb/>
            now the danger of an inundation was imminent and most <lb/>
            alarming.</p>
          <p>At this sight a general cry of horror and dismay arose in <lb/>
            the city, which might be heard even in the enemy's camp— <lb/>
            the wretched inhabitants stretched out their hands to the <lb/>
            gods, in whom only they had hope, and besought Oroondates <lb/>
            to send deputies with oilers of submission to Hydaspes, <lb/>
            He, reduced to be the slave of Fortune, unwillingly listened <lb/>
            to their entreaties; but he was entirely surrounded with <lb/>
            water, and it being out of his power to send an officer to <lb/>
            the enemy, he was reduced by necessity to this contrivance <lb/>
            -he wrote down the purport of their wishes, tied it to a stone, <lb/>
            and endeavoured, by means of a sling, to make it serve the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of a messenger by traversing the waters; but his design <lb/>
            was disappointed; the stone fell short, and dropped into the <lb/>
            water before it reached the other side. He repeated the <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            experiment several times. The archers and slingers strained <lb/>
            every nerve to accomplish that upon which they thought <lb/>
            their safety and life depended; but still without success. <lb/>
            At length, stretching out their hands to the enemy, who <lb/>
            stood on their works spectators of their distress, the miser­ <lb/>
            able citizens implored their compassion by the most piteous <lb/>
            gestures, and endeavoured to signify what was meant by <lb/>
            their ineffectual stones and arrows-now clasping their <lb/>
            hands together, and holding them forwards in a suppliant <lb/>
            manner—now putting their arms behind their backs, in <lb/>
            token that they submitted to servitude.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes understood their signs, and was ready to receive <lb/>
            their submission—for great minds are easily inclined to <lb/>
            clemency by the sight of a prostrate enemy-but he was <lb/>
            desirous first to make trial of their intentions.</p>
          <p>He had already prepared some river-craft, which floating <lb/>
            down the Nile, were drawn up near the mound: be chose <lb/>
            ten of these, and filling them with archers, he ordered them <lb/>
            what to say to the Persians, and sent them towards the <lb/>
            city. They set out well prepared to defend themselves, in <lb/>
            case the enemy should attempt anything against them.</p>
          <p>This passage of a vessel, from wall to wall, presented a <lb/>
            novel sight-mariners sailing over an inland country and <lb/>
            cultivated plains: war, which is wont to produce strange <lb/>
            spectacles, seldom, perhaps, afforded a more uncommon one <lb/>
            than this-a navy proceeding against a town, and sailors, in <lb/>
            boats, engaged with soldiers upon the walls.</p>
          <p>Those in the city observed the boats making for the part <lb/>
            of the wall which had fallen down, and their spirits being <lb/>
            sunk with their misfortunes, surrounded as they were with <lb/>
            perils, they began to suspect and dread the designs of those <lb/>
            who were coming for their preservation: for, in such ex­ <lb/>
            tremity of danger, everything is a cause of suspicion and of <lb/>
            fear.. They began, therefore, to cast their darts and to <lb/>
            shoot their arrows towards those who were in the boats: for <lb/>
            men, who despair of safety, think even the shortest delay <lb/>
            of destruction as so much gained. They flung their weapons, <lb/>
            however, in such a manner as not to inflict wounds, but <lb/>
            only to hinder the approach of the enemy.</p>
          <p>The Æthiopians returned the attack more in earnest, not <figure type="illustration">

              knowing the intentions of the Persians: they wounded <lb/>
              several of those who were upon the ramparts, some of whom <lb/>
              tumbled over into the water. The engagement was pro­ <lb/>
              ceeding with greater warmth, one party endeavouring <lb/>
              merely to repulse; the other to attack, when an old man, of <lb/>
              great authority among the Syenæans, who stood upon the <lb/>
              wall, thus addressed his fellow-citizens:</p>
          <p>Infatuated men! your distresses seem to have taken away <lb/>
            your senses. You have encouraged and besought the <lb/>
            Æthiopians to come to your assistance; and now, when <lb/>
            they are, beyond all your hopes, arrived, you do everything <lb/>
            in your power to drive them away again. If they come <lb/>
            with friendly intentions, and bring conditions of peace, they <lb/>
            are your preservers; if they have hostile designs, you need <lb/>
            not fear their landing; we are so numerous, that we shall <lb/>
            easily overpower them. But if we were to destroy all these, <lb/>
            what would it avail us, surrounded as we are by such a <lb/>
            cloud of enemies both by land and water? Let us then <lb/>
            receive them, and see what is their business here."</p>
          <p>This speech was received with approbation, both by the <lb/>
            people and the Viceroy; and withdrawing from the breached <lb/>
            portion of the wall, they stood motionless with their arms.</p>
          <p>When the space between the walls was thus cleared, the <lb/>
            inhabitants signed to the Æthiopians that they might freely <lb/>
            approach: they advanced, therefore, and when near enough, <lb/>
            they from their boats addressed the besieged multitude as <lb/>
            follows:</p>
          <p>" Persians! and inhabitants of Syene! Hydaspes, King <lb/>
            of the Eastern and Western Ethiopia, and now your sove­ <lb/>
            reign also, knows how to subdue his enemies, and to spare <lb/>
            those who supplicate his mercy—the one belongs to valour, <lb/>
            the other to humanity: the merit of the former belongs <lb/>
            chiefly to his soldiers; that of the latter is entirely his own. <lb/>
            Your safety or destruction is now in his hands; but since <lb/>
            you throw yourselves on his compassion, he releases you <lb/>
            from the impending and unavoidable dangers which encom­ <lb/>
            pass you. He does not himself name the conditions of <lb/>
            your deliverance, but leaves them to you to propose; he has <lb/>
            no desire to tyrannize over justice-he wishes to treat the <lb/>
            fortunes of men with equity: it</p>
          <p>To this address the inhabitants of Svene replied,—" That <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            they threw themselves, their wives and children, upon the <lb/>
            mercy of the Æthiopian prince, and were ready to sur­ <lb/>
            render their city (if they were spared), which was now <lb/>
            in such sore distress, that unless some god, or Hydaspes <lb/>
            himself, very speedily interposed, there were no hopes of its <lb/>
            preservation."</p>
          <p>Oroondates added,—" That he was ready to yield up, and <lb/>
            put into their hands, both the cause of the war, and its <lb/>
            prizes—the city of Philce, and the emerald mines: in return, <lb/>
            he required that neither lie nor his soldiers should be made <lb/>
            prisoners of war, but that Hydaspes, as a crowing act of <lb/>
            generosity, would permit them to retire to Elephantine upon <lb/>
            condition of their doing injury to no one: as to himself, it <lb/>
            was indifferent to him whether he laid down his life now, or <lb/>
            perished hereafter, by the sentence of his master, for having <lb/>
            lost his army; the latter alternative would indeed be the <lb/>
            worst, for now he would undergo a common, and possibly, an <lb/>
            easy kind of death; in the other case, he would have to suffer <lb/>
            the refinements of cruelty and torture. He also requested <lb/>
            them to receive two of his Persians into their boats, that they <lb/>
            might proceed to Elephantine, professing that if they found <lb/>
            the garrison of that city disposed to surrender to the Ethio­ <lb/>
            pians, he would no longer delay to follow their example."</p>
          <p>The delegates complied with his request; took the Per­ <lb/>
            sians on board, returned to the camp, and informed <lb/>
            Hydaspes of the result of their embassy.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes smiled at the infatuation of Oroondates, who <lb/>
            was insisting upon terms, while his very existence hung upon <lb/>
            another's will. " It would be foolish, however," said he, to <lb/>
            let so many suffer for the stupidity of one." Accordingly <lb/>
            he permitted those whom the Viceroy had sent to proceed <lb/>
            to Elephantine; little regarding whether the troops there <lb/>
            yielded or resisted. He ordered his men to close up the <lb/>
            breach which they bad made in the banks of the Nile, and <lb/>
            to make another in those of the mound or wall; so that the <lb/>
            river being prevented from flowing in at one opening and <lb/>
            the stagnant water retiring apace out of the other, the <lb/>
            space between his camp and Syene might soon be dry, and <lb/>
            practicable for his soldiers to march over.</p>
          <p>His commands were executed. His men made a begin­ <lb/>
            ning of the work, but night coming on deferred its com­ <note type="footnote">p 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            pletion till the next day. Meantime they who were in the <lb/>
            city omitted nothing which might contribute to their pre­ <lb/>
            servation, not despairing of preservation, though it ap­ <lb/>
            peared almost beyond hope.</p>
          <p>Some carried on their mine, which they now supposed <lb/>
            must approach near the enemy's mound; having com­ <lb/>
            puted, as well as they could, by means of a rope, the <lb/>
            interval between that and their own walls. Others repaired <lb/>
            the wall which had fallen down, working by torchlight, <lb/>
            readily finding materials from the stones which had fallen <lb/>
            inwards. They had, as they thought, tolerably well secured <lb/>
            themseves for the present; but were destined to have a new <lb/>
            alarm; in the middle of the night, a portion of the mound, <lb/>
            in that part where the enemy had been digging on the <lb/>
            preceding day, suddenly gave way. This was caused either <lb/>
            by the earth which formed the foundation being moist and <lb/>
            porous, or by the mining party having sapped the ground <lb/>
            above them, or by the ever-increasing body of water widen­ <lb/>
            ing the narrow breach, or perhaps it might be ascribed to <lb/>
            divine interposition. So tremendous was the noise and the <lb/>
            report, that the besiegers and besieged, though ignorant ot <lb/>
            the cause, imagined a great part of the city wall to have been <lb/>
            carried away; but the Æthiopians, feeling themselves safe in <lb/>
            their tents, deferred satisfying their curiosity till the morning.</p>
          <p>The inhabitants of Syene, on the contrary, were, with <lb/>
            reason, more solicitous; they immediately examined every <lb/>
            portion of their walls, and each finding all safe in his own <lb/>
            vicinity, concluded that the accident had happened in some <lb/>
            other part. The approach of daylight cleared up all their <lb/>
            doubts; the breach in the mound, and the retreat of the <lb/>
            waters, being then visible.</p>
          <p>And now the Ethiopians dammed up the breach in the <lb/>
            river'is bank, by fixing planks, supported by strong wooden <lb/>
            piles, strengthening them still more with a quantity of <lb/>
            earth and fascines, taken partly from the banks and partly <lb/>
            brought in boats, thousands labouring at the work. In <lb/>
            this way the water was got rid of. The space, however, <lb/>
            between the camp and the town was, as yet, by no means <lb/>
            passable, being very deep in mud and dirt; and though it <lb/>
            was in some places apparently dry ground, the surface was <lb/>
            thin, and treacherous for the feet either of horses or men.</p><pb n="213"/>
            
          <p>Thus passed two or three days. The Syenæans opened <lb/>
            their gates, and the Ethiopians discontinued all hostile <lb/>
            movements; the truce, however, was carried on without <lb/>
            any intercourse between the parties. Guards on either <lb/>
            side were discontinued; and they in the city gave them­ <lb/>
            selves up to pleasure and enjoyment.</p>
          <p>It happened that this was the season for celebrating the <lb/>
            overflowing of the Nile; a very solemn festival among the <lb/>
            Egyptians. It falls out about the time of the summer <lb/>
            solstice, when the river first begins to swell, and is observed <lb/>
            with great devotion throughout the country; for the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians deify the Nile, making him one of their principal gods; <lb/>
            and equalling him to heaven ;because they say, that without <lb/>
            clouds or rain he annually waters and fertilizes their fields; <lb/>
            this is the opinion of the vulgar. They consider it a proof <lb/>
            of his divinity, that the union of moist and dry being the <lb/>
            principal cause of animal life, he supplies the former, the <lb/>
            earth the latter quality (admitting also the existence of <lb/>
            other elements.) These opinions are promulgated among <lb/>
            the vulgar, but they who have been initiated in the mysteries, <lb/>
            call the earth ]sis,* the river Osiris, substituting words for <lb/>
            things. The goddess, they say, rejoices when the god makes <lb/>
            his appearance upon the plains, and grieves proportionably <lb/>
            when no is absent, feeling indignation against his enemy, <lb/>
            Typho.t</p>
          <p>The cause of this is, I imagine, that men skilled in divine <lb/>
            and human knowledge, have not chosen to disclose to the <lb/>
            vulgar the hidden significations contained under these <lb/>
            natural appearances, but veil them under fables; being <lb/>
            however ready to reveal them in a proper place, and with <lb/>
            due ceremonies, to those who are desirous and worthy of <lb/>
            being initiated.‡ So much I may be allowed to say with <lb/>
            permission of the deity, preserving a reverential silence as <lb/>
            to what relates to more mystic matters.</p>
          <p>I return now to the course of my story. The inhabitants <note type="footnote"> * See note to vol. L, p. 265, of Blakesley's Herodotus. </note><note type="footnote"> t The brother and murderer of Osiris, whose death was avenged by <lb/>

            of Syene were employed in celebrating their festival with <lb/>
            sacrifices and other ceremonies; their bodies, indeed, worn <lb/>
            with labour and suffering, but their minds filled with devotion <lb/>
            towards their deity, whom they honoured as best their <lb/>
            present circumstances would permit.</p>
          <p>Oroondates, taking the opportunity of the dead of night, <lb/>
            when the citizens, alter their fatigues and rejoicings, were <lb/>
            plunged in sleep, and having beforehand secretly acquainted <lb/>
            hisPersian soldiers with his intentions, and appointed <lb/>
            them the particular hour and gate at which they were to <lb/>
            assemble, led them out of their quarters.</p>
          <p>An order had been issued to every corporal. to leave the <lb/>
            horses and beasts of burden behind, that they might have <lb/>
            no impediment on their march, nor give any intimation of <lb/>
            their design, by the tumult which the mustering them would <lb/>
            cause. Orders were given to take their arms alone, and, <lb/>
            together with them, a beam or plank.</p>
          <p>As soon as they were assembled at the appointed gate, <lb/>
            they proceeded to lay their planks across the mud, (close to <lb/>
            one another) which were successively passed from hand to <lb/>
            hand, by those behind, to those in front. They passed over <lb/>
            them, as by a bridge, and the whole body reached, without <lb/>
            accident, the firm land.</p>
          <p>They found the Æthiopians sleeping in security, without <lb/>
            watch or guard ; and passing by them unperceived Oroon. <lb/>
            dates led his men with all possible speed to Elephantine. He <lb/>
            was readily received into the city by means of the two Per­ <lb/>
            sians whom he had sent before, and who, having watched, <lb/>
            night after night, caused the gates to be opened upon the <lb/>
            concerted watch-word being given.</p>
          <p>When day began to dawn, the inhabitants of Syene were <lb/>
            aware of the flight of their defenders. Every one missed <lb/>
            the Persian whom he had lodged in his house, and the sight <lb/>
            of tho planks laid over tho mud, confirmed them in their <lb/>
            suspicions, and explained the manner of it. They were <lb/>
            thrown into great consternation at this discovery; expecting, <lb/>
            with reason, a severe punishment, as for a second offence, <lb/>
            fearing they should be thought to have abused the clemency <lb/>
            of their conqueror, and to have connived at the escape of <lb/>
            the Persians. They determined therefore, after some con­ <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig38.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="215"/>
              sultation, to go out of the city in a body, to deliver themselves <lb/>
              up to Hydaspes, to attest their innocence with oaths, and <lb/>
              implore his mercy. Collecting together then all ranks and <lb/>
              ages, with the air of suppliants, they marched in procession, <lb/>
              over the bridge of planks. Some carried boughs of trees, <lb/>
              others tapers and torches, the sacred ensigns and images of <lb/>
              their goda preceding them as messengers of peace.</p>
          <p>When they approached the camp of the Æthiopians, they <lb/>
            fell down on their knees, raising, as with one consent, a <lb/>
            plaintive and mournful cry; and deprecating, by the most <lb/>
            humble gestures, the victor's wrath.</p>
          <p>They laid their infants on the ground before them, seem­ <lb/>
            ingly leaving them to wander whither chance might lead; <lb/>
            intending to pacify the wrath of the Æthiopians by the sight <lb/>
            of their innocent and guiltless age. The poor children, <lb/>
            frightened at the behaviour and outcries of their parents, <lb/>
            crept (some of them) towards the adverse army ; and with <lb/>
            their tottering steps and wailing voices, presented an affecting <lb/>
            scene, Fortune, as it were, converting them into instruments <lb/>
            of supplication.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes observing this uncommon spectacle, and con­ <lb/>
            ceiving that they were reiterating their former entreaties <lb/>
            and imploring pardon for their crime, sent to know what <lb/>
            they meant, and why they came alone, and without the <lb/>
            Persians.</p>
          <p>They related all which had happened-the flight of the <lb/>
            Persians, their own entire ignorance of it,-the festival <lb/>
            they had been celebrating, and the opportunity secretly <lb/>
            taken by the garrison to leave them, when they were buried <lb/>
            in sleep, after their feastings and fatigues; although, had <lb/>
            they been awake, and had they seen them, it would have <lb/>
            been out of their power, unarmed as they were, to hinder <lb/>
            the retreat of men in arms.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes from this relation suspected, as was really the <lb/>
            case, that Oroondates had some secret design and stratagem <lb/>
            against him; summoning the Egyptian priests therefore, and <lb/>
            for the sake of greater solemnity, adoring the images of the <lb/>
            gods which they carried with them, be inquired if they could <lb/>
            give him any further information about the Persians. lIe <lb/>
            asked whither they were gone, and what were their hopes <lb/>
            and intentions. They replied, " That they were ignorant of <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            their schemes; but supposed them to be gone to Elephan­ <lb/>
            tine, where the principal part of the army was assembled, <lb/>
            Oroondates placing his chief confidence in his barbed cavalry. <lb/>
            They concluded by beseeching him, if he had conceived any <lb/>
            resentment againat them to lay it aside, and to enter their <lb/>
            city, as if it were his own.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes did not choose to make his entry for the present, <lb/>
            but sent two troops of soldiers to search every place where <lb/>
            be suspected an ambush might be laid; if they found nothing <lb/>
            of that sort, destining them as a garrison for the city. He <lb/>
            dismissed the inhabitants of it with kindness and gracious <lb/>
            promises, and drew out his army ready to receive the attack <lb/>
            of the Persians, should they advance; or, to march against <lb/>
            them himself if they delayed.</p>
          <p>His troops were hardly formed in order of march when <lb/>
            his scouts informed him that the Persians were advancing <lb/>
            towards hint to give battle: Oroondates had assembled all <lb/>
            army at Elephantine, just at the time when as we have seen, <lb/>
            he was forced, by the sudden approach of the Ethiopians, <lb/>
            to throw himself into Syene with a few troops; being then <lb/>
            reduced to imminent danger by the contrivance of Hydaspes; <lb/>
            he secured the preservation of the place, and his own safety, <lb/>
            by a method which stamped him with the deepest perfidy. <lb/>
            The two Persians sent to Elephantine, under pretence of <lb/>
            inquiring on what terms the troops there were willing to <lb/>
            submit, were really dispatched with a view of informing him <lb/>
            whether they were ready and disposed to resist and fight, if <lb/>
            by any means he could escape, and put himself at their head.</p>
          <p>He now proceeded to put into practice his treacherous <lb/>
            intent, for upon his arrival at Elephantine, finding them in <lb/>
            such a disposition as he could wish, he led them out without <lb/>
            delay, and proceeded with all expedition against the enemy; <lb/>
            relying chiefly for success on the hope that by the rapidity <lb/>
            of his movements he should surprise them while unpre­ <lb/>
            pared. He was now in sight, attracting every eye by the <lb/>
            Persian pomp of his host; the whole plain glistening as he <lb/>
            moved along, with gold and silver armour. The rays of the <lb/>
            rising sun falling directly upon the advancing Persians, shed <lb/>
            an indiscribable brightness to the most distant parts, their <lb/>
            own armour flashing back a rival brightness.</p>
          <p>The right wing was composed of native Medes and <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            Persians—the heavy armed in front-behind them the <lb/>
            archers, unincumbered with defensive arms, that they might <lb/>
            with more ease and readiness perform their evolutions, <lb/>
            protected by those who were before them. The Egyptians, <lb/>
            the Africans, and all the auxiliaries were in the left wing. <lb/>
            To these likewise were assigned a band of light troops, <lb/>
            slingers and archers, who were ordered to make sallies, and <lb/>
            to discharge their weapons from the flanks. Oroondates <lb/>
            himself was in the centre, splendidly accoutred and mounted <lb/>
            on a scythed chariot.* He was surrounded on either side <lb/>
            by a body of troops, and in front were the barbed cavalry, <lb/>
            his confidence in whom had principally induced him to <lb/>
            hazard an engagement. These are the most warlike in <lb/>
            the Persian service, and are always first opposed, like a firm <lb/>

            except a small opening left for the eyes, in his right hand he <lb/>

            not his breast alone, but his whole body also, is sheathed in <lb/>

            of brass or steel, a span in length, fitting over each other at <lb/>
            each of the four sides, and hooked or sewn together beneath, <lb/>

            imbricated scaly tunic, which fits it closely, yet by contrao­ <lb/>

            is sleeved, and reaches from neck to knee,* the only part <lb/>
            left unarmed being under the cuishes, necessity for the seat <lb/>
            on horseback so requiring. The greave extends from the feet <lb/>
            to the knee, and is connected with the coat. This defence is <lb/>
            sufficient to turn aside all darts, and to resist the stroke of <lb/>
            any weapon. The horse is as well protected as his rider; <lb/>
            greaves cover his legs, and a frontal † confines his head. <lb/>
            From his back to his belly, on either side, hangs a sheet of <lb/>
            the mail, which I have been describing, which guards his <lb/>
            body, while its looseness does not impede his motions.</p>
          <p>Thus accoutred and as it were fitted‡ into his armour, this <lb/>
            ponderous soldier sits his horse, unable to mount himself on <lb/>
            account of his weight, but lifted on by another. When the <lb/>
            time for charging arrives, giving the reins, and setting spurs <lb/>
            to his horse, he is carried with all his force against the <lb/>
            enemy, wearing the appearance of a hammer-wrought statue, <lb/>
            or of an iron man. His long and pointed spear extends <lb/>
            far before him, and is sustained by a rest at the horse's <lb/>
            neck, the butt being fixed in another at his croupe. Thus <lb/>
            the spear does not give way in the conflict, but assists the <lb/>
            band of the horseman, who has merely to direct the weapon, <lb/>
            which pressing onwards with mighty power pierces every <lb/>
            obstacle, sometimes transfixing and bearing off by its impulse <lb/>

              In opposition to the centre, boasting as they did of their <lb/>
              barbed cavalry, he placed himself, with the tower-bearing <lb/>
              elephants, the Blemmyæ, and the Seres, giving them instruc­ <lb/>
              tions what they were to do when they came to engage. <lb/>
              Both armies now approached near, and gave the signal for <lb/>
              battle; the Persians with trumpets, the Æthiopians with <lb/>
              drums and gongs. Oroondates, cheering on his men, charged <lb/>
              with his body of horse. Hydaspes ordered his troops to ad­ <lb/>
              vance very slowly, that they might not leave their elephants, <lb/>
              and that the enemy's cavalry, having a longer course to take, <lb/>
              might become exhausted before the conflict. When the <lb/>
              Blemmyæ saw them within reach of a spear's cast, the <lb/>
              horsemen urging on their horses for the charge, they pro­ <lb/>
              ceeded to execute their monarch's instructions.</p>
          <p>Leaving the Seres to guard the elephants, they sprang <lb/>
            out of the ranks, and advanced swiftly towards the enemy. <lb/>
            The Persians thought they had lost their senses, seeing a <lb/>
            few foot presume to oppose themselves to so numerous and <lb/>
            so formidable a body of horse. These latter galloped on all <lb/>
            the faster, glad to take advantage of their rashness, and <lb/>
            confident that they should sweep them away at the first <lb/>
            onset. But the Blemmyæ, when now the phalanx had <lb/>
            almost reached them, and they were all but touched by <lb/>
            their spears, on a sudden, at a signal, threw themselves on <lb/>
            one knee, and thrust their heads and backs under the horses, <lb/>
            running no danger by this attempt, but that of being tram­ <lb/>
            pled on : this manœuvre was quite unexpected, many of the <lb/>
            horses they wounded in the belly as they passed, so that <lb/>
            they no longer obeyed tho bridle, but became furious, and <lb/>
            throw their riders; whom, as they lay like logs, the Blemmyæ <lb/>
            pierced in the only vulnerable part, tho Persian cuirassier <lb/>
            being incapable of moving without help.</p>
          <p>Those whose horses were not wounded proceeded to <lb/>
            charge the Seres, who at their approach retired behind the <lb/>
            elephants, as behind a wall or bulwark. Here an almost <lb/>
            total slaughter of the cavalry took place. For the horses <lb/>
            of the Persians, as soon as the sudden retreat of the Seres <note type="footnote"> * See Herod B. ii. 111. </note> <lb/>

            had discovered these enormous beasts, astonished at their <lb/>
            unusual and formidable appearance, either turned short <lb/>
            round and galloped off, or fell back upon the rest, so that <lb/>
            the whole body was thrown into confusion. They who <lb/>
            were stationed in the towers upon the elephants (six in <lb/>
            number, two on either side (except towards the beast's hind <lb/>
            quarters), discharged their arrows as from a bulwark, so <lb/>
            continuously and with such true aim, that they appeared to <lb/>

          <p>Fighting upon unequal terms against mailed warriors, and <lb/>

            aim at the sight holes. of the enemy, that you might see <lb/>
            many galloping in confusion through the throng, with arrows <lb/>
            projecting from their eyes.</p>
          <p>Some, carried away by the unruliness of their horses to <lb/>
            the elephants, were either trampled under foot or attacked <lb/>
            by the Seres and the Blemmyæ, who rushing out as from an <lb/>
            ambush, wounded some, and pulled others from their horses, <lb/>
            in the melee. They who escaped unhurt retreated in disorder, <lb/>
            not having done the smallest injury to the elephants : for <lb/>
            these beasts are armed with mail when led out to battle, and <lb/>
            have, besides, a natural defence in a hard and rugged skin, <lb/>
            which will resist and turn the point of any spear.</p>
          <p>Oroondates, when he saw the remainder routed, set the <lb/>
            example of a shameful flight; and descending from his <lb/>
            chariot, and mounting a Nysæan horse,t galloped from the <lb/>
            field. The Egyptians and Africans in the left wing were <lb/>
            ignorant of this, and continued still bravely fighting, receiv­ <lb/>

            being naked, and their only clothing this crown of arrows. <lb/>
            These arrows require no iron point; they take a serpent's <lb/>

            patient, and bravely prodigal of their lives, not merely for <lb/>
            pay but glory; perhaps, too, dreading the punishment of <lb/>
            runaways. But when they heard that the barbed cavalry, <lb/>

            had followed his example, they likewise, at last, gave up the <lb/>
            contest, turned about, and retreated. Hydaspes, from an <lb/>
            elephant's back, as from a watch tower, was spectator of his <lb/>
            victory; which when he saw decided, he sent messengers <lb/>
            after the pursuers, to stop the slaughter, and to order them <lb/>
            to take as many prisoners as they could, and particularly, <lb/>
            were it possible, Oroondates.</p>
          <p>Success crowned his wishes, for the Ethiopians extending <lb/>
            their numerous lines to a great length on each side, and <lb/>
            curving the extremities till they surrounded the Persians, <lb/>
            left them no way to escape but to the river. Thus the stra­ <lb/>

            found turned against themselves, multitudes being forced <lb/>
            into the river by the horses and scythed chariots, and the <note type="footnote"> * Arrows somewhat resembling these are used by the wild Bush. <lb/>

            by having the river in his rear be was cutting off his own <lb/>
            means of escape. He was taken prisoner with Achæmenes <lb/>

            think you, that you deserve?"—"The same," returned the <lb/>
            other, " which my master would inflict upon one of your <lb/>
            captains who bad fallen into his power, after having proved <lb/>
            his fidelity to you."—" If your master," replied the Æthi­ <lb/>
            opian, " were truly royal, and not a tyrant, he would praise <lb/>
            and reward him ; and excite the emulation of his own <lb/>

            it seems to me, good sir, that you praise your fidelity at the <lb/>
            expence of your prudence, after having adventured yourself <lb/>
            against so many myriads of my troops."—" Perhaps," re­ <lb/>
            plied Oroondates, " in regard to myself, I have not been so <lb/>
            imprudent as may at first appear. I knew the disposition <lb/>
            of my sovereign-to punish cowards, rather than to reward <lb/>
            the brave. I determined therefore to hazard every thing, <lb/>

          <p>Hydaspes, after listening to his words, praised him, sent <lb/>
            him to Syene, ordered his physicians to attend him, and <lb/>
            all possible care to be taken of him. He himself soon after <lb/>
            made his public entry into the city, with the flower of his <lb/>
            army. The inhabitants of all ranks and ages went out in <lb/>
            procession to meet him, strewed crowns and flowers* of the <lb/>
            Nile, in his path, greeting him with songs of victory.</p>
          <p>He entered the city on an elephant, as on a triumphal <lb/>
            chariot, and immediately turned his thoughts to holv matters <lb/>
            and thanksgivings to the gods. He made inquiries concern­ <lb/>
            ing everything worthy ot his curiosity, particularly about <lb/>
            the origin of the feasts of the Nile. They shewed him a <lb/>
            tank which served as a nilometer, like that which is at <lb/>
            Memphis, lined with polished stone, and marked with degrees <lb/>
            at the interval of every cubit. The water flows into it under <lb/>
            ground, and the height to which it rises in the tank, shews <lb/>
            the general excess, or deficiency, of the inundation, according <lb/>
            as the degrees are covered or left bare. They shewed him <lb/>
            dials, which, at a certain season of the year, cast no shade at <lb/>
            noon; for, at the summer solstice, the sun is vertical at <lb/>
            Syene, and darts its rays perpendicularly down, so that the <lb/>
            water,! at the bottom of the deepest wells, is light.</p>
          <p>This, however, raised no great astonishment in Hydaspes; <lb/>
            for the same phenomenon happens at the Æthiopian Meröe. <lb/>
            The people of Syene loudly praised their festival and extolled <lb/>
            the Nile, calling it Horus (the year), the fertilizer of their <lb/>
            plains-the preserver of Upper Egypt-the father, and, in a <lb/>

            amount to 365 units, the number of days which make up the <lb/>
            year.. They extolled also its peculiar plants and flowers, and <lb/>
            animals, and added a thousand other encomiums. " All these <lb/>
            praises," said Hydaspes, " belong more to Ethiopia, than <lb/>
            to Egypt. If you esteem this river as the father of waters, <lb/>
            and exalt it to the rank of a deity, Ethiopia ought surely to <lb/>
            be worshipped, which is the mother of your god:"</p>
          <p>" We do worship it," replied the priests, " both on many <lb/>
            other accounts, and because it has sent you to us, as a pre­ <lb/>
            server and a god." After recommending them to be less <lb/>
            lavish in their praises, he retired to a tent which had <lb/>
            been prepared for him, and devoted the rest of the day to <lb/>
            ease and refreshment. He entertained, at his own table, <lb/>
            his principal officers, and the priests of Syene, and <lb/>
            encouraged all ranks to make merry. The inhabitants of <lb/>
            Syene furnished herds of oxen, flocks of sheep, goats and <lb/>
            swine, together with store of wine, partly by way of gift, <lb/>
            partly for sale. The next day he mounted a lofty seat; and, <lb/>
            ordering the spoil to be brought out, which had been col. <lb/>
            lected in the city, and on the field of battle, distributed it <lb/>
            amongst his army, in such proportions as he thought their <lb/>
            met it deserved. When the soldier appeared who took Oro. <lb/>
            ondates, "Ask what you please," said the king.—"I have <lb/>
            no occasion to ask anything," he replied. " If you will allow <lb/>
            me to keep what I have already taken from the Viceroy, I <lb/>
            am sufficiently rewarded for having made him prisoner, and <lb/>
            preserved him alive, according to your commands." And <lb/>
            with this he shewed a sword belt, a scimitar richly jewelled of <lb/>
            great value, and worth many talents; so that many cried out, <lb/>
            it was it gift too precious for a private man, a treasure worthy <lb/>
            of a monarch's acceptance. Hydaspes smilingly replied­</p>
          <p>" What can be more kingly than that my magnanimity <lb/>
            should be superior to this man's avarice? Besides, the <lb/>
            captor has a right to the personal spoils of his prisoner. <lb/>
            Let him then, receive as a gift from me, what ho might <lb/>
            easily have taken to himself, without my knowledge." <note type="footnote"> • <foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign> — 50; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε</foreign> — 5; ;—10; A — 30; a - 70; a — 200; total, 365. </note> <pb n="225"/>
            </p>
          <p>Presently those who had taken Theagenes and Chariclea <lb/>
            appeared. " Our spoil, 0 king!" said they, " is not gold <lb/>
            and jewels, things of little estimation among the Æthiopians, <lb/>
            and which lie in heaps in the royal treasures; but we bring <lb/>
            you a youth and a maiden, a Grecian pair, excelling all <lb/>
            mortals in grace and beauty, except yourself, and we expect <lb/>
            from your liberality a proportionate reward."—“ You recall <lb/>
            them seasonably to my memory," replied Hydaspes. "When <lb/>
            I first saw them, in the hurry and confusion in which I was <lb/>
            engaged, I took but a cursory view of them. Let some one <lb/>
            bring them now before me, together with the rest of the <lb/>
            captives."</p>
          <p>An officer was immediately despatched for them to the <lb/>
            place of their confinement, which was among the baggage, at <lb/>
            some distance from the town. They inquired, in their way <lb/>
            to the city, of one of their guards, whither they were being <lb/>
            conducted. They were told that the king Hydaspes <lb/>
            desired to see the prisoners. On hearing the name, they <lb/>
            cried out together, with one voice—" 0 ye gods!" fearing <lb/>
            till that hour least some other might be the reigning king; <lb/>
            and Theagenes said softly to Chariclea—"You will surely <lb/>
            now discover to the king everything which relates to us, <lb/>
            since you have frequently told me that Hydaspes was your <lb/>
            father."</p>
          <p>"Important matters," replied Chariclea, "require great pre­ <lb/>
            paration. Where the deity has caused intricate beginnings, <lb/>
            there must needs be intricate unravellings. Besides, a tale <lb/>
            like ours is not to be told in a moment; nor do I think it <lb/>
            advisable to enter upon it in the absence of my mother <lb/>
            Persina, upon whose support, and testimony, the foundation <lb/>
            of our story, and the whole of our credit, must depend; and <lb/>
            the, thanks to the gods I hear, is yet alive."</p>
          <p>'• What if we should be sacrificed," returned Theagenes ; <lb/>
            is or, presented to some one as a gift, how shall we ever get <lb/>
            into AEthiopia —"Nothing is less likely said Chariclea. <lb/>
            "Our guards have told us that we are to be reserved as victime, <lb/>
            to be offered to the deities of Meröe. There is no likelihood <lb/>
            that we, who are solemnly devoted to the gods, should be des­ <lb/>
            troyed, or otherwise disposed of; such a vow no religious mind <lb/>
            would break. Were we to give way to the incautious joy <lb/>
            with which this sudden gleam of good fortune transports us, <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            and discover our condition, and relate our adventures. In the <lb/>
            absence of those who alone can acknowledge us, and confirm <lb/>
            what we say, we run the greatest risk of raising the indig­ <lb/>
            nation of the king; who would regard it as a mockery and <lb/>
            insult, that we, captives and slaves as we are, should endea­ <lb/>
            vour to pass ourselves off upon him, as his children."</p>
          <p>" But the tokens," said Theagenes, " which I know you <lb/>
            always carry about you, will give credit to our relation, and <lb/>
            shew that we are not impostors."—"These things," replied <lb/>
            Chariclea, " are real tokens to those who know them, and <lb/>
            who exposed them with me ; but to those who are ignorant <lb/>
            of this, they are nothing but bracelets, and precious stones; <lb/>
            and may possibly induce a suspicion of our having stolen <lb/>
            them. Supposing even that Hydaspes should recollect any <lb/>
            of these trinkets, who shall persuade him that they were <lb/>
            presented to me by Persina, and still more, that they were <lb/>
            the gifts of a mother to her daughter ? The most incontro­ <lb/>
            vertible token, my dear Theagenes, is a mother's nature, <lb/>
            through which the parent at first sight feels affection towards <lb/>
            her offspring,—an affection stirred up by secret sympathy. <lb/>
            Shall we deprive ourselves, then, by our precipitation, of this <lb/>
            most favourable opening, upon which depends the credit of <lb/>
            all we have to say</p>
          <p>Discoursing in this manner, they arrived near the tribunal <lb/>
            of the king. Bagoas was led after them. When Hydaspes <lb/>
            saw them, rising suddenly from his throne-" May the gods <lb/>
            he propitious to me!" he exclaimed, and sat down again, <lb/>
            lost in thought. They who were near him inquired the <lb/>
            reason of this sudden emotion. Recollecting himself, he <lb/>
            said-" Methought that I had a daughter born to me this <lb/>
            day, who at once reached her prime, and perfectly resembled <lb/>
            this young maiden, whom I see before me. I disregarded, <lb/>
            n:id had almost forgotten my dream, when this remarkable <lb/>
            resemblance recalled it to my memory."</p>
          <p>His officers replied—" That it was some fancy of the mind <lb/>
            bodying forth future events;" upon which the king, laying <lb/>
            aside for the present any farther thought )on the subject, <lb/>
            proceeded to examine his prisoners. He asked them­ <lb/>
            ”Who, and from whence, they were?" Chariclea was <lb/>
            silent. Theagenes replied, " That they were Grecians, and <lb/>
            that the maiden was his sister."</p><pb n="227"/>
            
          <p>“ All honour to Greece," said Hydaspes—" the mother of <lb/>
            brave and beautiful mortals, for affording us such noble <lb/>
            victims for the celebration of our triumphal sacrifices." <lb/>
            And turning to his attendants, he said—"Why bad I not <lb/>
            a son as well as a daughter born to me in my dream, since <lb/>
            this youth, being the maiden's brother, ought according to <lb/>
            your observation, to have been shadowed forth to me in my <lb/>
            vision ?"</p>
          <p>He then directed his discourse to Chariclea, speaking in <lb/>
            Greek; a language known and studied by the Gymnoso­ <lb/>
            phists, and kings of Æthiopia-" And you, 0 maiden," <lb/>
            said he, " why do you make no answer to my questions ?" <lb/>
            —' At the altars of the gods," replied she, " to whom we <lb/>
            are destined as victims, you shall know who I am, and who <lb/>
            are my parents."</p>
          <p>is And what part of the world do they inhabit ?" said the <lb/>
            king.-" They are present now," said she, "and will assuredly <lb/>
            be present, when we are sacrificed." Again Hydaspe's <lb/>
            smiled.—" This dream-born daughter of mine," lie observed, <lb/>
            " is certainly herself dreaming, when she imagines that her <lb/>
            parents are to be brought from the middle of Greece into <lb/>
            Meröe. Let them be taken away and served with the usual <lb/>
            care and abundance, to fit them for the sacrifices. But who <lb/>
            is this standing near, and in person like an eunuch?"*— <lb/>
            " He is an eunuch," replied one of the bystanders; " his <lb/>
            name is Bagoas; he was in great favour with Oroondates."</p>
          <p>" Let him too," said the king, " follow and be kept with <lb/>
            the Grecian pair; not as a future victim, but that he may <lb/>
            attend upon, and watch over the virgin victim, whom it is <lb/>
            necessary to preserve in the utmost purity for the sacrifice; <lb/>
            and whose beauty is such, that her virtue, unguarded, may <lb/>
            be exposed to much danger and temptation. Eunuchs are <lb/>
            a jealous race; and fitly employed for debarring others from <lb/>
            the enjoyments of which they are themselves deprived." <lb/>
            He then proceeded to examine and decide the fate of the <lb/>
            remaining prisoners, who appeared in order; distributing <lb/>
            among his followers those who were slaves before; dismissing <lb/>
            with liberty those who were free and noble : but he selected <lb/>
            ten young men, and as many virgins, in the bloom of youth <note type="footnote">✶ " .vetus, vietus, veternosus, senex <lb/>

            and beauty, whom he ordered to be preserved for the sanie <lb/>
            purpose to which he had destined Theagenes and Chariclea. <lb/>
            And having answered every complaint and application, at <lb/>
            last he sent for Oroondates, who was brought in lying on <lb/>
            a litter.</p>
          <p>"I," said he to him, " now that I havo obtained the <lb/>
            object of my going to war, feel not the common passion of <lb/>
            ambitious minds. I am not going to make my good fortune <lb/>
            the minister of covetousness; my victory creates in me no <lb/>
            wish to extend my empire. I am content with the limits <lb/>
            which nature seems to have placed between Egypt and <lb/>
            Æthiopia—the cataracts. Having recovered then what I <lb/>
            think my right, I revere what is just and equitable, and <lb/>
            shall return peacefully to my own dominions. Do you, if <lb/>
            your life be spared, remain viceroy of the same province as <lb/>
            before: and write to your master, the Persian king, to this <lb/>
            effect, 'Thy brother Hydaspes has conquered by might of <lb/>
            hand ; but restores all through moderation of mind; he <lb/>
            wishes to preserve thy friendship, esteeming it the most <lb/>
            valuable of all possessions: at the same time, if desirous of <lb/>
            renewing the contest, thou wilt not find him backward.' <lb/>
            As to the Syenæans I remit their tribute for ten years; and <lb/>
            command thee to do the same." Loud acclamations, both <lb/>
            from the soldiers and citizens, followed his last words.</p>
          <p>Oroondates crossing his hands, and inclining his body, <lb/>
            adored him; a compliment not usual for a Persian to pay <lb/>
            to any prince, except his own.—" 0 ye who hear me," <lb/>
            said he, “ I do not think that I violate the customs of my <lb/>
            country, as to my own sovereign, in adoring the most just <lb/>
            of kings, who has restored to me my government; who <lb/>
            instead of putting me to death has granted me my life; who, <lb/>
            able to act as a despotic lord, permits me to remain a viceroy. <lb/>
            should I recover, 1 pledge myself to promote a solid peace <lb/>
            and lasting friendship between the Persians and Æthiopians, <lb/>
            and to procure for the Syenæans that remission of tribute <lb/>
            which has been enjoined; but should I not survive, may <lb/>
            the gods recompense Hydaspes, his family, and remotest <lb/>
            descendants, for all the benefits which he has conferred <lb/>

          <p>WE have now said sufficient about Syene, which, from <lb/>
            the brink of danger, was at once restored to security and <lb/>
            happiness, by one man's clemency.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes, having sent the greater part of his army for­ <lb/>
            ward, proceeded in person towards Æthiopia, followed by <lb/>
            the applauses and blessings both of Persians and Syenæans. <lb/>
            At first he marched along the Nile, or the parts bordering <lb/>
            upon that river; but when he reached the cataracts, having <lb/>
            sacrificed to the river, and to the gods of the boundaries, he <lb/>
            turned aside, and travelled through the inland country.</p>
          <p>When he arrived at Philœ, he rested, and refreshed his <lb/>
            army there for two days ; and then as before, sending part <lb/>
            of it forward, together with the captives, he staid some <lb/>
            little time behind them, to direct the repair of the walls, <lb/>
            and to place a garrison, and soon afterwards set out himself. <lb/>
            He dispatched an express consisting of two troopers, who <lb/>
            changing their horses at every station, and using all speed, <lb/>
            were to announce his victory at Merde. *</p>
          <p>He sent the following message to the wise men of his <lb/>
            country, who are called Gymnosophists, and who are the <lb/>
            assessors and privy councillors of the Æthiopian kings in <lb/>
            affairs of moment.</p>
          <p>“ Hydaspes to the most holy Council.</p>
          <p>" I acquaint you with my victory over the Persians. I do <lb/>
            not boast of my success, for I know and fear the mutability <lb/>
            of fortune; but I would greet your holy order, which I <lb/>
            have always found wise and faithful. I invite and command <lb/>
            your attendance at the usual place, in order that the thanks­ <lb/>
            giving sacrifices for victory, may, by your presence, be <lb/>
            rendered more august and solemn in the sight of the <lb/>
            Æthiopian people."</p>
          <p>To his consort, Persina, he wrote as follows</p>
          <p>" Know that I am returning a conqueror, and, what you <lb/>
            will still more rejoice at, unhurt. Make therefore prepara­ <lb/>
            tions for the most sumptuous processions and sacrifices, that <lb/>
            we may give thanks to the gods, for the blessings which</p>
          <p>* In. Bk. viii., 98, Herodotus gives an account of the Persian system <lb/>
            of estafette—comparing 'Hit to the torch race:—" <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κατάπερ "Ελλησι ή <lb/>

            they have bestowed. In accordance with my letters, assist <lb/>
            in summoning the Gymnosophists; and hasten to attend, <lb/>
            with them, in the consecrated field before the citv, which is <lb/>
            dedicated to our country'is gods—the Sun, the Moon, and <lb/>
            Bacchus."</p>
          <p>When this letter was delivered to Persina—“ I now see, to <lb/>
            said she, " the interpretation of a dream which I had last <lb/>
            night. Methought I was pregnant, and in labour, and that <lb/>
            I brought forth a daughter in the full bloom of youth and <lb/>
            beauty. I see, that by my throes, were signified the travails <lb/>
            of war; and by my daughter, this victory."</p>
          <p>" Go," continued she, “ and fill the city with these joyful <lb/>
            tidings." The expresses obeyed her commands; and <lb/>
            mounting their horses, having crowned their heads with the <lb/>
            lotus of the Nile, and waving branches of palm in their <lb/>
            hands, rode through the principal parts of the city, dis­ <lb/>
            closing by their very appearance, the joyous news.</p>
          <p>Meröeresounded with rejoicings; night and day the <lb/>
            inhabitants, in every family, and street, and tribe, made <lb/>
            processions, offered sacrifices, and suspended garlands in <lb/>
            the temples; not more out of gratitude for the victory, <lb/>
            than for the safety of Hydaspes; whose justice and cle­ <lb/>
            money, mildness and affability, had made him beloved, like <lb/>
            a father, by his subjects. The queen, on her side, collected <lb/>
            together from all parts, quantities of sheep and oxen, of <lb/>
            horses and wild asses, of hippogriffs,*and all sorts of ani­ <lb/>
            mals, and sent them into the sacred field, partly to furnish <lb/>
            an hecatomb of each, for sacrifice, partly to provide from <lb/>
            the remainder, an entertainment for all the people.</p>
          <p>She next visited the Gymnosophists, who inhabit the <lb/>
            grove of Pan, and exhorted them to obey the summons of <lb/>
            their king, as also to gratify her by adorning and sanctify­ <lb/>
            ing the solemnity with their presence. They, entreating <lb/>
            her to wait a few moments, while they consulted the gods, <lb/>
            as they are used to do on any new undertaking, entered <lb/>

            same time, they signify to us, that this sacrifice will be <lb/>
            attended with much disturbance and tumult, which, how­ <lb/>
            ever, will have an agreeable and happy end. A limb of <lb/>
            your body, or a member of the state, seems to have been <lb/>
            lost; which will be restored by fate."</p>
          <p>“ Your presence," said Persina, “ will avert every threat­ <lb/>
            ening presage, and change it into good; I will take care to <lb/>
            inform you when Hydaspes arrives."</p>
          <p>" You will have no occasion to do that," replied Sisimi­ <lb/>
            thres: " he will arrive to-morrow, and you will presently <lb/>
            receive letters to that effect." His prediction was fulfilled. <lb/>
            Persina, on her return to the palace, found a messenger <lb/>
            with letters from the king, announcing his intended <lb/>
            arrival for the following day.</p>
          <p>Tho heralds dispersed the news through the city, and at <lb/>
            tho same time, mado proclamation, that the men alone <lb/>
            should bo suffered to go out and meet him, but that the <lb/>
            women should keep within their houses; for, as the sacrifice <lb/>
            was destined to bo offered to the purest of all deities—the <lb/>
            Sun and Moon—the presence of females was forbidden, lest <lb/>
            the victims should acquire even an involuntary contamination.</p>
          <p>The priestess of tho Moon was tho only woman sufFered <lb/>
            to attend the ceremony, and she was Persina; for by the <lb/>
            Jaw and custom of the country, the queens of Æthiopia are <lb/>
            always priestesses of that divinity, as the kings are of the <lb/>
            Sun. Chariclea, also was to be present at the ceremonial, <lb/>
            not as a spectatress, but as a victim to the Moon.</p>
          <p>The eagerness and curiosity of the citizens was incredible. <lb/>
            Before they knew the appointed day, they poured in mul­ <lb/>
            titudes out of the city, crossed the river Astabora, some <lb/>
            over the bridge; some who dwelt at a distance from it, in <lb/>
            boats made of canes, many of which lay near the banks, <lb/>
            affording an expeditious means of passage.</p>
          <p>These little skiffs are very swift, both on account or the <lb/>
            materials of which they are composed, and the slight bur­ <lb/>
            den which they carry, which never exceeds two or three <lb/>
            men: for ono cano is split in two, and each section forms <lb/>
            a boat.* <note type="footnote"> * See Blakesley's edit. of Herod. iiL 98: where mention is made of <lb/>

            the length of the boats, made of the internodal wood, often exceeded <lb/>

          <p>Meröe, the metropolis of Ethiopia, is situated in a sort <lb/>
            of triangular island, formed by the confluence of three navi. <lb/>
            gable rivers; the Nile, the Astabora, and the Asasoba. <lb/>
            The former flows towards it from above, where it forms <lb/>
            two branches; the others, flowing round it on either side, <lb/>
            unite their waters, and hasten to mingle their stream, and <lb/>
            lose their names, in the channel of the Nile.</p>
          <p>This island, which is almost a continent, (being in length <lb/>
            three thousand furlongs, in width one thousand), abounds <lb/>
            in animals of every kind, and, among the rest, with ele­ <lb/>
            phants. It is especially fertile in producing trees. The <lb/>
            palm trees rise to an unusual height, bearing dates of large <lb/>
            size and delicious flavour. The stalks of wheat and barley <lb/>
            are so tall, as to cover and conceal a man when mounted <lb/>
            on a horse or camel, and they multiply their fruit three <lb/>
            hundred fold. The canes are of the size which I have <lb/>
            before mentioned.</p>
          <p>All the night were the inhabitants employed in crossing <lb/>
            the river; they met, received, and congratulated Hydaspes, <lb/>
            extolling him as a god. They had gone a considerable way <lb/>
            to meet him. The Gymnosophists went only a little beyond <lb/>
            the sacred field, when, taking his hand, they kissed him. <lb/>
            Next appeared Persina at the vestibule, and within the <lb/>
            precincts of the temple.</p>
          <p>After worshipping the gods, and returning thanks for his <lb/>
            victory and safety, they left the precincts, and prepared to <lb/>
            attend the approaching sacrifice, repairing for that purpose <lb/>
            to a tent, which had been erected for them on the plain. <lb/>
            Four canes, newly cut down, were fixed in the ground, one <lb/>
            at each corner, serving as a pillar, supported the vaulted <lb/>
            roof, which was covered with the branches of palm and <lb/>
            other trees. Near this another tent was erected, raised <lb/>
            considerably from the ground, in which were placed the <lb/>
            images of the gods of the country—Memnon, Perseus, and <lb/>
            Andromeda—whom the kings of Æthiopia boasted to be the <lb/>
            founders of their race : under these, on a lower story, having <lb/>
            their gods above them, sat the Gymnosophists. A large pore <lb/>
            tion of the ground was surrounded by the soldiers; who in <lb/>
            close order, and with their shields joined, kept off the mule <lb/>
            titude, and afforded a clear space sufficient for the priests to <lb/>
            erform their sacrifice, without confusion or disturbance.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes, after speaking briefly upon the victory which <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            he had gained, and the advantages obtained by it to the <lb/>
            state, commanded the sacred ministers to begin their rites.</p>
          <p>Three lofty altars were erected, two in close proximity to <lb/>
            the Sun and Moon; a third, at some distance, to Bacchus: <lb/>
            to him they sacrificed animals of every kind, as being a <lb/>
            common deity, gracious and bountiful to all. To the Sun <lb/>
            they offered four white horses, the swiftest of animals to <lb/>
            the swiftest of the gods to the Moon, a yoke of oxen, con­ <lb/>
            secrating to her, as being nearest the earth, their assistants <lb/>
            in agriculture.</p>
          <p>While these things were transacting, a loud confused <lb/>
            murmur began to rise as among a promiscuous multitude; <lb/>
            “ Let our country's rites be performed-let the appointed <lb/>
            sacrifice be made-let the first-fruits of war be offered to <lb/>
            onr gods."</p>
          <p>Hydaspes understood that it was a human victim whom <lb/>
            they demanded, which it was customary to offer from among <lb/>
            the prisoners taken only in a foreign war. Making a <lb/>
            motion for silence, with his hand, he intimated to them, by <lb/>
            gestures, that they should soon have what they required, <lb/>
            and ordered those who had the charge of the captives to <lb/>
            bring them forward. They obeyed, and led them forth, <lb/>
            guarded, but freed from their chains.</p>
          <p>The generality were, as may be imagined, dejected and <lb/>
            sorrowful. Theagenes, however, appeared much less so than <lb/>
            the others; but the countenance of Chariclea was cheerful <lb/>
            and elate. She fixed her eyes upon Persina with a fixed and <lb/>
            steady glance, so as to cause in her considerable emotion; <lb/>
            she could not help sighing, as she said—“ 0 husband ! what <lb/>
            a maiden have you destined for sacrifice! I never remember <lb/>
            to have seen such beauty. How noble is her presence! <lb/>
            with what spirit and fortitude does she seem to meet her <lb/>
            impending fate ! How worthy is she of compassion, owing <lb/>
            to the flower of her age. If my only and unfortunately lost <lb/>
            daughter were living, she would be about the same age. <lb/>
            O that it were possible to save this maiden from destruc­ <lb/>
            tion ; it would be a great satisfaction to me to have her in <lb/>
            my service. She is probably Grecian, for she has not at all <lb/>
            the air of an Egyptian." <note type="footnote"> * Herod. i. 216, states the same concerning the Massagetæ, and <lb/>
            assigns the same cause:—“ <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τω̃νθεω̃ντω̜̃ταχίτω̜̃πάντωντω̜̃νθνη</foreign><unclear>ω̜̃</unclear>. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸτάχιστονδατέονται</foreign>.”</note> <pb n="234"/>
             </p>
          <p>"She is from Greece," replied Hydaspes: "who are her <lb/>
            parents she will presently declare ; shew them she cannot, <lb/>
            though such has been her promise. To deliver her from <lb/>
            sacrifice is impossible: were it in my power, I should be <lb/>
            very glad to do so ; for I feel, I know not why, great com­ <lb/>
            passion and affection for her. But you are aware that the <lb/>
            law requires a male to be offered to the Sun, and a female <lb/>
            to the Moon; and she being the first captive presented to <lb/>
            me, and having been allotted for the sacrifice, the disap­ <lb/>
            pointment of the people's wishes would admit of no excuse. <lb/>
            One only chance can favour her escape, and that is, if she <lb/>
            should be found when she ascends the pile, not to have <lb/>
            preserved her chastity inviolate; for the law demands a <lb/>
            pure victim to be offered to the goddess as well as to the <lb/>
            god—the condition of those offered on the altar of Bacchus <lb/>
            is indifferent. But should she be found unchaste, reflect <lb/>
            whether it would be proper that she should be received <lb/>
            into your family.”</p>
          <p>" Let her," replied Persina, " be found unchaste, provided <lb/>
            only she be preserved. Captivity and war, absence from <lb/>
            friends, and a wandering life, furnish an excuse for guilt, <lb/>
            particularly in her, whose transcendent beauty must have <lb/>
            exposed her to more than common temptations.”</p>
          <p>While she was weeping and striving to conceal her weak­ <lb/>
            ness from the people, Hydaspes ordered the fire-altar* to <lb/>
            be prepared, and brought out. A number of young children, <lb/>
            collected by the officials from among the multitude, brought <lb/>
            it from the temple (they alone being permitted to touch <lb/>
            it), and placed it in the midst. Each of the captives was <lb/>
            then ordered to ascend it. It was furnished with golden <lb/>
            bars of such mystic virtue, that whenever any unchaste or <lb/>
            perjured person placed his foot upon it, it burnt him imme­ <lb/>
            diately, and he was obliged to retire : the pure, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, and the uncontaminated, could mount it uninjured.</p>
          <p>The greatest part of the prisoners failed in the trial, and <lb/>
            were destined as victims to Bacchus, and the other gods­ <lb/>
            save two or three Grecian maidens whose virginity was <lb/>
            found intact. Theagenes at length ascended it, and was <lb/>
            found pure. It raised great admiration in the assembly, <lb/>
            that with his beauty, stature, and in the flower of youth, ho <lb/>
            should be a stranger to the power of love—accordingly <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="235"/>
              be was destined as an offering to the Sun. He said softly <lb/>
              to Chariclea—“Is death then, and sacrifice, the reward <lb/>
              which the Æthiopians bestow upon purity and integrity P <lb/>
              But why, my dearest life, do you not discover yourself? <lb/>
              How long will you delay ? Until the sacrificer's knife is <lb/>
              at your throat ? Speak, I beseech you, and disclose your <lb/>
              condition. Perhaps when you are known, your intercession <lb/>
              may preserve me; but if that should not happen, you will be <lb/>
              safe, and then I shall die with comfort and satisfaction.”</p>
          <p>" Our trial, to said Chariclea, " now approaches—our fate <lb/>
            trembles in the balance.. "-So saying, and without await­ <lb/>
            ing any command, she drew from out of a scrip which <lb/>
            she had with her, and put on, her sacred Delphic robe, <lb/>
            interwoven and glittering with rays of light. She let her <lb/>
            hair fall dishevelled upon her shoulders, and as under the <lb/>
            influence of inspiration, leaped upon the altar, and remained <lb/>
            there a long time, unhurt.</p>
          <p>Dazzling every beholder with more than ever resplendent <lb/>
            beauty; visible to all from this elevated place, and with her <lb/>
            peculiar dress, she resembled an image of the goddess, more <lb/>
            than a mere mortal maiden. An inarticulate murmur of <lb/>
            applause ran through the multitude, expressive of their <lb/>
            surprise and admiration, that with charms so superhuman, <lb/>
            she should have preserved her honour, enhancing her beauty <lb/>
            by her chastity.† Yet they were almost sorry that she was <lb/>
            found a pure and fitting victim for the goddess. Notwith­ <lb/>
            standing their religious reverence they would have been glad <lb/>
            could she by any means escape. But Persina felt more for <lb/>
            her than all the rest. She could not help saying to Hydas­ <lb/>
            pes—“ How miserable and ill-fated is this poor maiden! <lb/>
            To no purpose giving token of her purity ! Receiving for <lb/>
            her many virtues only an untimely death ? Can nothing be <lb/>
            done to save her ?”</p>
          <p>“Nothing, I fear,”replied the king: “your wishes and <lb/>
            pity are unavailable. It seems that the gods have from the <lb/>
            beginning selected by reason of her very excellence this <lb/>
            perfect victim for themselves.” And then directing bis dis­ <lb/>
            course to the Gymnosophists : "Sages," said he, "since every <lb/>
            thing is ready, why do you not begin the sacrifice ?—“Far <figure type="illustration">

              be it from us," said Sisimithres (speaking in Greek, that <lb/>
              the multitude might not understand him) to assist at such <lb/>
              rites; our eyes and ears have already been sufficiently <lb/>
              wounded by the preparations. We will retire into the <lb/>
              temple, abhorring ourselves the detestable offering of a <lb/>
              human victim, and believing too that the gods do not ap­ <lb/>
              prove it. Would that the sacrifices even of brute animals <lb/>
              might cease; those consisting of prayers and incense being. <lb/>
              to our mind, sufficient.*Do you, however, remain ; for the <lb/>
              presence of a ruler is sometimes necessary to stay the <lb/>
              turbulence of the multitude. Go on with this unhallowed <lb/>
              sacrifice, since the inveterate custom of the people has <lb/>
              made it unavoiable; remembering that when it is performed, <lb/>
              yourself will stand in need of expiation, though perhaps, <lb/>
              you will not need it, for I think this rite will never be <lb/>
              brought to consummation. I judge from various divine <lb/>
              tokens, and particularly from a kind of glory shed around <lb/>
              these strangers, signifying that they are under the peculiar <lb/>
              protection of the gods;”—having said this, he arose, and <lb/>
              was about to retire with his brethren.</p>
          <p>At this instant Chariclea leapt down from the altar; <lb/>
            rushed towards Sisimithres, and fell at his feet. The officials <lb/>
            would have hindered her, supposing that sho was deprecating <lb/>
            death, but she exclaimed! " Stay, Sages, I beseech you! I <lb/>
            have a cause to plead before the king and queen ; you are <lb/>
            the only judges, in such a presence; you must decide <lb/>
            in this, the trial for my life. You will find that it is neither <lb/>
            possible nor just that I should be sacrificed to the gods." <lb/>
            They listened to her readily, and addressing the king, said, <lb/>
            -" Do you hear, 0 king; the challenge and averment of <lb/>
            this foreign maiden."</p>
          <p>Hydaspes smiling, replied, "What controvesy can she <lb/>
            have with me ? From what pretext, or from what right, <lb/>
            can it arise?”—“That, her own relation will discover" <lb/>
            said Sisimithres.—“ But will it not be an indignity," rather <lb/>
            than an act of justice, rejoined the monarch, “ for a king to <lb/>
            enter into a judicial dispute with a slave?”—“Equity regards <lb/>
            not lofty rank," said the sage. "He is king in judgment <note type="footnote"> * " Immunis aram si tetigit manus, <lb/>

            who prevails by strength of arguments.”—“ But,”returned <lb/>
            llydaspes, “ yoUr office gives you a right of deciding only <lb/>
            when a controversy arises between the king and his own <lb/>
            subjects, not between him and foreigners.“—”Justice,” said <lb/>
            Sisimithres, "is weighed among the wise, not by mere appear­ <lb/>
            ances, but by facts.”—“ It is clear that she can have nothing <lb/>
            serious to advance," said the king, "but some mere idle pretext <lb/>
            to delay her fate, as is the case with those who are in fear <lb/>
            of their lives. Let her, however, speak, since Sisimithres <lb/>
            would have it so."</p>
          <p>Chariclea, who had always been sanguine, in expecting <lb/>
            her deliverance, was now inspired with additional confidence <lb/>
            when she heard the name of Sisimithres. He was the <lb/>
            person to whose care she had been committed ten years <lb/>
            before, and who delivered her to Charicles at Catadupa, <lb/>
            when he was sent ambassador to Oroondates in the matter <lb/>
            of the emerald mines-he was then one of the ordinary <lb/>
            Gymnosopbists: : but now, he was their president. Chari­ <lb/>
            clea did not call to mind his face (having been parted from <lb/>
            him when only seven years’old), but recollected and rejoiced <lb/>
            at hearing his name, trusting that she should find in him <lb/>
            a support and an advocate. Stretching out then her hands <lb/>
            towards heaven, and speaking audibly,—“O Sun!” she <lb/>
            exclaimed, " author of my family; and you, ye gods and <lb/>
            heroes who adorn my race! I call you to witness the truth <lb/>
            of what I say. Be you my supporters and assistants in the <lb/>
            trial which I am about to undergo—my cause is just, and <lb/>
            thus I enter upon it:—Does the law, 0 king, command <lb/>
            you to sacrifice natives or foreigners ?”</p>
          <p>“Foreigners only," replied Hydaspes.—“You must then <lb/>
            seek another victim,”said she, " for you will find me a <lb/>
            native." The king seemed surprised, declaring it to be a <lb/>
            figment. “Do you wonder at this ?” said she; “you will <lb/>
            hear much stranger things. I am not only a native, but <lb/>
            closely allied to the royal family." This assertion was re­ <lb/>
            ceived with contempt, as so much idle speech: when she <lb/>
            added—“ Cease, my father, to despise and reject your <lb/>
            daughter!</p>
          <p>By this time the king began to appear not only contemp­ <lb/>
            tuous, but indignant, taking the matter as a personal insult <lb/>
            to himself. He said, therefore, to Sisimithres,—“Behold <lb/>
            the reward of my endurance I Is not the maiden downright <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            mad Endeavouring with wild and incredible fictions to <lb/>
            escape the fate awaiting her! desperately feigning herself <lb/>
            to be my daughter, as in some sudden appearance and dis­ <lb/>
            covery upon the stage-mine, who was never so fortunate <lb/>
            as to have any offspring. Once, indeed, I heard of a daugh­ <lb/>
            ter's birth, only, however, to learn her death. Let then <lb/>
            some one lead her away, that the sacrifice may be no longer <lb/>
            deferred."—" No one shall lead me away," cried out Chari­ <lb/>
            clea, " till the judges have given sentence. You are in this <lb/>
            affair a party, not a judge; the law perhaps permits you to <lb/>
            sacrifice foreigners, but to sacrifice your children, neither <lb/>
            law nor nature allows ; and the gods shall this day declare <lb/>
            you to be my father, however unwilling you appear to own <lb/>
            me. Every cause, 0 king, which comes for judgment, leans <lb/>
            principally upon two kinds of proof, written evidence, and <lb/>
            that of living witnesses : both these will I bring forward to <lb/>
            prove myself your child. I shall appeal to no common <lb/>
            witness, but to my judge himself (the consciousness of <lb/>
            the judge is the prisoner's best ground of confidence) ; <lb/>
            as to my written evidence it shall be a history of my own <lb/>
            and your misfortunes." So saying, she loosened from her <lb/>
            waist the fillet- which had been exposed with her, unrolled, <lb/>
            and presented it to Persina. She, as soon as it met her <lb/>
            sight, appeared struck dumb with astonishment; she con­ <lb/>
            tinued a considerable time casting her eyes first on the <lb/>
            writing, then again on the maiden. A cold sweat bedewed <lb/>
            her limbs, and convulsive tremblings shook her frame.</p>
          <p>Her first emotions were those of joy and hope; but <lb/>
            anxiety and doubt succeeded. Dread of the suspicions <lb/>
            of Hydaspes followed; of his incredulity, and perhaps of <lb/>
            his anger and vengeance.</p>
          <p>The king observing her agitation and astonishment, said <lb/>
            to her, " Persina! what is it which ails you? from what <lb/>
            cause has this writing such effect upon you ?"—" My king, <lb/>
            my lord, and my husband!" she replied, "I know not <lb/>
            what to answer you: take and read it yourself: let this <lb/>
            fillet explain everything." She gave it him, and remained <lb/>
            trembling, in anxious silence.</p>
          <p>He took the fillet, and began to read it, calling to the <lb/>
            Gymnosophists to read it with him. As he proceeded, he <lb/>
            was struck with doubt and amazement; but Sisimithres <note type="footnote"> * See Book iv. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            Was still more astonished: his ever-changing colour betrayed <lb/>
            the various emotions of his mind: he fixed his eyes now <lb/>
            on the fillet, and now on Chariclea.</p>
          <p>At length Hydaspes, when he came to the account of the <lb/>
            exposing of the infant, and the cause of it, broke silence, <lb/>
            and said, " I know that I had once a daughter born to me, <lb/>
            having been told that it died almost as soon as it was born. <lb/>
            This writing now informs me that it was exposed : but who <lb/>
            took it up, who preserved, who educated it ? who brought <lb/>
            it into Egypt ? Was that person, whoever he were, taken <lb/>
            captive at the same time with her? How shall I be satisfied <lb/>
            that this is the real child that was exposed ? May she not <lb/>
            have perished ? May not these tokens have fallen into the <lb/>
            hands of some one, who takes advantage of this chance ? <lb/>
            May not some evil genius be paltering with my desire of <lb/>
            offspring, and clothed with the person of this maiden, be <lb/>
            endeavouring to pass off a supposititions birth as my successor, <lb/>
            —overshadowing the truth with this fillet, as with a cloud?</p>
          <p>But now Sisimithres replied, "I can clear up some of <lb/>
            your doubts; for I am the person who took her up, who <lb/>
            educated and carried her into Egypt, when you sent me thither <lb/>
            on an embassy. You know me too well to suspect me of <lb/>
            asserting what is untrue. I perfectly recollect the fillet, <lb/>
            which is inscribed with the royal characters of the kings of <lb/>
            Ethiopia, which you cannot suspect to have been counter­ <lb/>
            felted elsewhere ; for you yourself must recognize the hand­ <lb/>
            writing of Persina. But there were other tokens exposed <lb/>
            with her, which I delivered at the same time to him who <lb/>
            received the damsel from me, who was a Grecian, and, in <lb/>
            appearance, an honest and worthy man."</p>
          <p>"I have preserved them likewise,' said Chariclea, and <lb/>
            immediately shewed the necklace and the bracelet. Persina <lb/>
            was yet more affected when she saw these..</p>
          <p>Hydaspes still inquiring what all this agitation could <lb/>
            mean, and whether she had anything to discover which <lb/>
            might throw light upon this matter; she answered, " that <lb/>
            she certainly had, but it was an examination more proper <lb/>
            to be made in private than in public."</p>
          <p>Hydaspes was more than ever perplexed, and Chariclea <lb/>
            proceeded—" Those are the tokens of my mother; but this <lb/>
            ring is a present of your own;" and produced the stone <lb/>
            Pantarbè.</p><pb n="240"/>
            
          <p>The king instantly recollected it as a present which he <lb/>
            ,ad made to his wife during the time of their betrothment; <lb/>
            and he said, " Maiden, these tokens were certainly mine; <lb/>
            but how does it appear that you possess them as my child, <lb/>
            and have not obtained them by some other means ? Besides, <lb/>
            in addition to my other doubts, your complexion is totally <lb/>
            different from that of an Æthiopian."</p>
          <p>Here Sisimithres interposed, and said, " The child whom <lb/>
            I took up was perfectly white: and farther, the time when <lb/>
            I found her seems very closely to coincide with the age of <lb/>
            the maiden, for it is just seventeen years since this hap­ <lb/>
            pened. The colour of her eyes too occurred to me as being <lb/>
            the same; in short, I recognize in her the general expres­ <lb/>
            sion of her features, and in her surpassing beauty a resem­ <lb/>
            blance with what I recollect of the child then exposed."</p>
          <p>" This is all very well," replied Hydaspes, "you speak with <lb/>
            the fervour of the advocate more than as the judge; but take <lb/>
            care lest while you are clearing up one doubt, you do not <lb/>
            raise another, and that a more serious one; throwing sus­ <lb/>
            picions upon the virtue of my consort; as we are both <lb/>
            Æthiopians, how could we for our offspring have a white <lb/>
            child ?"</p>
          <p>Sisimithres, with rather a sarcastic smile, replied, " I <lb/>
            know not why you should object to me, that I am an <lb/>
            advocate for this maiden. He is the best judge who in­ <lb/>
            clines to the side of right: may I not rather be called an <lb/>
            advocate for you, while I am endeavouring, with the assist­ <lb/>
            ance of the gods, to establish your right to be called a <lb/>
            father; and neglecting no means to restore to you, in the <lb/>
            bloom of her youth, that daughter whom I preserved in <lb/>
            swathing bands ? However, deem of me as you please, I <lb/>
            do not esteem it necessary to make any apology; we do not <lb/>
            shape our lives so as to please others: we endeavour to <lb/>
            follow the dictates of truth and virtue, and think it sufficient <lb/>
            if we can approve our conduct to ourselves: yet, as to the <lb/>
            doubt which you entertain concerning her complexion, the <lb/>
            writing clears this up, explaining how Persina, from her <lb/>
            contemplation of Andromeda, might have received an im­ <lb/>
            pression upon her mind agreeing with the subject of the <lb/>
            picture. If you wish for farther proof, the original is at <lb/>
            hand; examine the Andromeda, the likeness between the <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            picture and the maiden will be found unmistakeably <lb/>
            exact."</p>
          <p>The king complied: and had the picture brought; <lb/>
            when being placed near Chariclea, an instant cry of sur­ <lb/>
            prise, admiration, and joy, was raised throughout the <lb/>
            assembly, at the striking likeness; those who were near <lb/>
            enough to understand what was passing, spreading the <lb/>
            intelligence among the rest.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes could no longer doubt, and he stood for some <lb/>
            time motionless, between wonder and pleasure. But Sisi­ <lb/>
            mithres added, " One thing is still necessary to complete <lb/>
            the proof; for recollect the succession to the kingdom, <lb/>
            and the truth itself is now in question. Bare your arm, <lb/>
            my child; there was a black mark upon it, a little above the <lb/>
            elbow. There is nothing unseemly in doing this, in order to <lb/>
            establish the evidence of your birth and family." Chariclea <lb/>
            obeyed, and uncovered her left arm, when there appeared, <lb/>
            as it were, an ebon ring, staining the ivory. of her arm.</p>
          <p>But Persina could now no longer contain herself—she leapt <lb/>
            from her throne, burst into tears, rushed into her daughter's <lb/>
            embrace, and could express her transports only by an inar­ <lb/>
            ticulate murmur. For excess of joy will sometimes beget <lb/>
            grief. They had nearly fainted and fallen on the ground.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes felt for his consort, affected as she was, and a <lb/>
            kindred emotion was gaining possession of himself; yet he <lb/>
            gazed upon the spectacle with eyes as unmoved† as though <lb/>
            they were of iron, struggling against his tears, his mind con­ <lb/>
            tending between fatherly feeling and manly fortitude, and <lb/>
            tossed to and fro as by opposing tides. At last he was <lb/>
            overpowered by all conquering nature; he not only believed <lb/>
            himself to be a father, but was sensible of a father's feelings. <lb/>
            Raising Persina, he was seen to embrace his daughter, <lb/>
            pouring over her the paternal libation of his tears.</p>
          <p>He was not, however, driven from that propriety which <lb/>
            the circumstances demanded. Recollecting himself a little, <lb/>
            and observing the multitude equally affected, shedding <note type="footnote"> * In the version printed in 1717 is a curious blunder in the word <lb/>

              tears of pleasure and compassion at the wonderful events <lb/>
              which had taken place, and not heeding the voices of the <lb/>
              heralds, who were enjoining silence, he waved his hand, and <lb/>
              stilling the tumult, thus addressed them:—"You see me, <lb/>
              by the favour of the gods, and beyond all my expectations, <lb/>
              entitled at length to the name of a father. This maiden is <lb/>
              shewn to be my daughter by proofs which are infallible: <lb/>
              but- my love for you, and for my country, is so great, that <lb/>
              disregarding the continuance of my race, and the succession <lb/>
              to my throne, and the new and dear appellation which I <lb/>
              have just acquired, I am ready to sacrifice her to the gods <lb/>
              for your advantage. I see you weep; I see you moved <lb/>
              by the feelings of humanity; you pity the age of this <lb/>
              maiden, immature for death; you pity my vainly cherished <lb/>
              hope of a successor, yet even against your wills, I must obey <lb/>
              the customs of my country, and prefer the public weal to <lb/>
              any private feelings of my own. Whether it be the will of <lb/>
              the gods just to shew me a daughter, and then take her <lb/>
              away again (shewing her to me at her birth, taking her <lb/>
              away now that sibe is found),† I leave you to judge: I am <lb/>
              unable to determine. As little can I decide whether they <lb/>
              will permit her to be sacrificed, when, after driving her <lb/>
              from her native land to the extremes! ends of the earth, <lb/>
              they have, as by a miracle, brought her back again a captive; <lb/>
              but if it be expedient that I sacrifice her whom I slew not <lb/>
              as an enemy, nor injured as a prisoner, at the instant when <lb/>
              she is recognized to be my daughter I will not hesitate, nor <lb/>
              yield to affections which might be pardonable in any other <lb/>
              father. I will not falter nor implore your compassion to <lb/>
              acquit me of obedience to the law, out of regard to the feel­ <lb/>
              ings of nature and affection, nor even suggest that it is <lb/>
              possible the deity may be appeased and satisfied by another <lb/>
              victim; but as ] see you sympathize with me, and feel my <lb/>
              misfortunes as your own, even so much more does it become <lb/>
              me to prefer your good to every other consideration, little <lb/>
              regarding this sore grief, little regarding the distress of my <lb/>
              poor Queen, made a mother and at the same moment <lb/>
              rendered childless. Dry then your tears, repress your <note type="footnote"> * See the speech of Agamemnon, in the Iphigenia in Aulis, 1242. </note><note type="footnote"> t " Ostendent terria hunc tantùm fata, neque ultrà <lb/>

              ineffectual grief for ever, and prepare for this necessary <lb/>
              sacrifice: and, thou, my daughter! (now first and now <lb/>
              last do I address thee by this longed-for name,) beauteous <lb/>
              to no purpose, and in vain discovered to thy parents! thou <lb/>
              who hast found thy native land more cruel than any <lb/>
              foreign region! who hast found a strange land thy pre­ <lb/>
              server, but wilt find thy native country thy destroyer! do <lb/>
              not thou break my heart, by mournful tears; if ever thou <lb/>
              hast shewed a high and royal spirit, shew it now. Follow <lb/>
              thy father, who is unable to adorn thee as a bride; who <lb/>
              leads thee to no nuptial chamber; but who decks thee for <lb/>
              a sacrifice; who kindles, not torch of marriage, but the altar <lb/>
              torch, and now offers as a victim this thine unrivalled loveli­ <lb/>
              ness. Do you too, 0 ye gods! be propitious, even if any­ <lb/>
              thing unbecoming or disrespectful has escaped me, overcome <lb/>
              as I am, by grief, at calling this maiden daughter, and at <lb/>
              the same time being her destroyer! So saying, he made <lb/>
              a shew of leading Chariclea to the pyre, with palpitating <lb/>
              heart, and deprecating the success of the speech, which he <lb/>
              had made in order to steal away the people's wills.</p>
          <p>The whole multitude was strongly excited by these words <lb/>
            -they would not suffer her to be led a step towards the <lb/>
            altar; but loudly and with one voice cried out—"Save the <lb/>
            maiden! Preserve the royal blood! Deliver her whom the <lb/>
            gods evidently protect! We are satisfied; the custom has <lb/>
            been sufficiently complied with. We acknowledge thee our <lb/>
            king: do thou acknowledge thyself a father; may the gods <lb/>
            pardon the seeming disobedience; we shall be much more <lb/>
            disobedient by thwarting their will; let no one slay her <lb/>
            who has been preserved by them. Thou who art the father <lb/>
            of thy country, be also the father of thy family! These, <lb/>
            and a thousand such like exclamations, were heard from <lb/>
            every side. At length they prepared to prevent by force the <lb/>
            sacrifice of Chariclea, and demanded steadily that the other <lb/>
            victims alone should be offered to the gods.</p>
          <p>Gladly and readily did Hydaspes suffer himself to be <lb/>
            persuaded, and to submit to this seeming violence: he <lb/>
            heard with pleasure the cries and congratulations of the <lb/>
            assembly, and allowed them the indulgence of their wills, <lb/>
            waiting till the tumult should spontaneously subside.</p>
          <p>Finding himself near Chariclea, he said: —" My dear <note type="footnote"> B2 </note> <lb/>

            your brother, when you were first brought into my presence <lb/>
            at Syene ? He is not likely to be found my son, for Persina <lb/>
            had only one child, yourself."</p>
          <p>Chanclea, casting her eyes on the ground, blushed, and <lb/>
            said :-" He is not, I confess, my brother: necessity ex­ <lb/>
            torted that fiction from me. Who he is, he will better <lb/>
            explain than I can."</p>
          <p>Hydaspes not readily comprehending what she meant, <lb/>
            replied :-" Forgive me, my child, if I have asked a ques­ <lb/>
            tion ( oncerning this young man which it seems to hurt your <lb/>
            maiden modesty to answer. Go into the tent to your <lb/>
            mother, cause her more rejoicing now, than you caused her <lb/>
            pain when she gave you birth; add to her present enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment, by relating every particular about yourself. Mean­ <lb/>
            while, we will proceed with the sacrifice, selecting, if possible, <lb/>
            a victim worthy to be offered with this youth instead of you."</p>
          <p>Chariclea was nearly shrieking at mention of sacrificing <lb/>
            the young man; hardly could she for ultimate advantage, <lb/>
            check her frenzied feelings, so as to wind her way covertly <lb/>
            towards the end she had in view. " Sire, said she, " per. <lb/>
            haps there needs not to seek out another maiden, since <lb/>
            the people remitted in my person the sacrifice of any female <lb/>
            victim ? But if they insist that a pair of either sex should <lb/>
            be sacrified, see if it be not necessary for you to find out <lb/>
            another youth, as well as another maiden; or, if that be <lb/>
            not done, whether I must not still be offered."</p>
          <p>" The gods forbid !" replied Hydaspes; " but why should <lb/>
            you say this ?"</p>
          <p>" Because," said sibe, "the gods have decreed that he is <lb/>
            to live with me, or die with me."</p>
          <p>" I commend your humanity," replied the king," in that <lb/>
            having so hardly escaped yourself, you are desirous of <lb/>
            saving a foreigner, a Greek, a fellow-prisoner, and of the <lb/>
            same age, with whom, from a communion in misfortunes, <lb/>
            you must have contracted some degree of familiarity and <lb/>
            friendship: but he cannot be exempted from the sacrifice; <lb/>
            religion will not permit our country's custom to be in <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            everything curtailed, neither would the people suffer it, who <lb/>
            have with difficulty been persuaded by the goodness of the <lb/>
            deities to spare you."</p>
          <p>" 0 king!" said Chariclea, " for perhaps I may not pre­ <lb/>
            sume to call you father, since the mercy of the gods has <lb/>
            saved my body, let me implore their and your clemency to <lb/>
            preserve my soul :* they know with how much justice I call <lb/>
            him so, since they have so closely interwoven the web of my <lb/>
            destiny with his. But if his fate is irretrievably deter­ <lb/>
            mined ; as if a foreigner he must necessarily sufter, I ask only <lb/>
            one favour—Let me with my own band perform the sacri­ <lb/>
            fice; let me grasp the sword—even like a precious treasure <lb/>
            —and signalize my fortitude before the Æthiopians."</p>
          <p>Hydaspes was astonished and confounded at this strange <lb/>
            request. "I know not what to make," said he, "of this <lb/>
            sudden change in your disposition: but a moment ago you <lb/>
            were anxious to save this stranger, and now you desire per­ <lb/>
            mission to destroy him as an enemy with your own hands; <lb/>
            but there is nothing either honourable or becoming your <lb/>
            sex or age in such a deed: granting that there were, it is im­ <lb/>
            possible ; it is an office exclusively belonging to the priests <lb/>
            and priestesses of the Sun and Moon, the one must be a <lb/>
            husband; the other is required to be a wife ; so that even <lb/>
            the fact of your virginity would be sufficient to preclude <lb/>
            this unaccountable request.</p>
          <p>" There need be no obstacle here," rejoined Chariclea, <lb/>
            blushing, and whispering her mother, she said, " give but <lb/>
            your consent and I already have one who answers to the <lb/>
            name of husband."—"We will consent," replied Persina, <lb/>
            smiling, it and will bestow your hand at once, if we can find <lb/>
            a match worthy of yourself and us."—" Then," said Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea, raising her voice, " your search need not be long, it <lb/>
            is already found."</p>
          <p>She was proceeding (for the imminent danger of Thea­ <lb/>
            genes made her bold, and caused her to break through the <lb/>
            restraints of maiden modesty), when Hydaspes, becoming <lb/>
            impatient, said—" How do ye, 0 gods, mingle blessings and <lb/>
            misfortunes! and mar the happiness ye have bestowed upon <lb/>
            me ye restore, beyond all my hopes, a daughter, but ye <lb/>
            restore her frenzy-stricken! for is not her mind frenzied <note type="footnote"> * " Et serves animæ dimidium meæ."—Hor. I. Od. iii. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            when sEe utters such inconsistencies P She first calls this <lb/>
            stranger her brother, who is no such thing; next, when <lb/>
            asked who the stranger is, she says she knows not; then <lb/>
            she is very anxious to preserve him, as a friend, from suffer­ <lb/>
            ing ; and, failing in this, appears desirous of sacrificing him <lb/>
            with her own hands; and when we tell her that none but <lb/>
            one who is wedded can lawfully perform this office, then <lb/>
            she declares herself a wife but does not name her husband. <lb/>
            How can she indeed ? She whom the altar proves never to <lb/>
            have bad a husband; unless the unfailing ordeal of chastity <lb/>
            among the Ethiopians has, in her case only, proved falla­ <lb/>
            cious, dismissing her unscathed, and bestowing upon her <lb/>
            the spurious reputation of virginity ; upon her, who with one <lb/>
            breath calls the same person her friend and enemy, and <lb/>
            invents a brother and a husband who have no existence ? <lb/>
            Do you, then, my Queen, retire into your tent, and endea­ <lb/>
            vour to recall this maiden to her senses: for either she <lb/>
            is frenzied by the deity, who is approaching the sacri­ <lb/>
            fices, or else she is distraught through her unexpected pre­ <lb/>
            servation. I will have search made for the victim, due to <lb/>
            the gods, as an offering in her stead ; meanwhile I will give <lb/>
            audience to the ambassadors of the different nations, and <lb/>
            will receive the presents brought in congratulation of my <lb/>
            victory." So saying, he seated himself in a conspicuous place <lb/>
            near the tent, and commanded the ambassadors to be intro­ <lb/>
            duced, and to bring what gifts they had to offer.</p>
          <p>Harmonias, the lord in waiting,. inquired whether they <lb/>
            should all approach without distinction, or a few selected <lb/>
            from every nation; or whether he should introduce each <lb/>
            separately.</p>
          <p>" Let them come separately in turn, said the king, " that <lb/>
            each may be questioned according to his deserts."</p>
          <p>" Your nephew, then, Merœbus," said Harmonias, " must <lb/>
            first appear; he is just arrived, and is waiting outside the <lb/>
            troops for his introduction."</p>
          <p>" You silly, stupid fellow," replied Hydaspes, " why did <lb/>
            you not announce him instantly r Do you not know that <lb/>
            he is not a mere ambassador, but a king, the son of my own <lb/>
            brother (not long deceased), placed by me on his father's <lb/>
            throne, and adopted by me as my own BOll ?" <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">είσαγγελεὺς</foreign>. See Herod. III. 84. </note> <pb n="247"/>
            </p>
          <p>" I was aware of it, my lord," replied Harmonias; " but <lb/>
            I considered that the duty of a lord in waiting required him <lb/>
            above all things, to observe a proper time and season. Par­ <lb/>
            don me, therefore, if when I saw you speaking with the <lb/>
            royal ladies, I felt averse to drawing your attention from <lb/>
            matters of such delight."</p>
          <p>" Let him enter now, then, replied the king. The mas­ <lb/>
            ter of the ceremonies hastened out, and soon returned with <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Merœbus was a handsome youth, just past the season of <lb/>
            boyhood, his age being about seventeen ; but he exceeded in <lb/>
            stature almost all those who surrounded him, and his suite <lb/>
            was splendid and numerous. The Æthiopian guards opened <lb/>
            on either side to let him pass, and regarded him with wonder <lb/>
            and respect.</p>
          <p>Hydaspes himself rose from his throne to meet him, em­ <lb/>
            braced him with fatherly affection, placed him by his side, <lb/>
            and taking him by the hand said, "Nephew, you are come <lb/>
            very seasonably both to assist at a triumphal sacrifice, and a <lb/>
            nuptial ceremony; for the gods, the authors and protectors <lb/>
            of our family, have restored to me a daughter, and provided, <lb/>
            ns it seems, for you a wife. The particulars you shall hear <lb/>
            hereafter; at present if you have any business relating to <lb/>
            the nation which you govern, make me acquainted with it.,,</p>
          <p>The youth,* at the mention of a wife, was seen to blush <lb/>
            through his dark complexion from mingled pleasure and <lb/>
            modesty (the red rushing, as it were, to the surface of the <lb/>
            black). After an interval he said, " The other ambassadors, <lb/>
            my Father, in honour of your splendid victory, bring you <lb/>
            the choicest productions of their several countries: 1, as a <lb/>
            suitable compliment to a brave and first-rate warrior, make <lb/>
            you an offering after your own heart, a champion who is in­ <lb/>
            vincible ; not to be matched either in wrestling, or boxing, or <lb/>
            in the race-" and so, saying, he motioned to the man <lb/>
            alluded to, to advance.</p>
          <p>He came forward and made his adoration to Hydaspes. <note type="footnote"> * It would be unfair to deprive the reader of the very quaint render­ <lb/>
            ing of this passage in the version of 1717 : " Merœbus, young and bash­ <lb/>
            ful, and wonderfully tickled at the thoughts of a bride, blushed <lb/>
            through his black skin, his face looking like a ball of soot that had takes <lb/>
            fire." </note> <pb n="248"/>
            </p>
          <p>So vast and " old world* " was his stature, that when kissing <lb/>
            the king's knees, his head nearly equalled those who sat on <lb/>
            raised seats above him ; and, without waiting for any orders, <lb/>
            he stripped and challenged any one to engage with him, <lb/>
            either with skill of arms, or with strength of hands. And <lb/>
            when, after many proclamations made, no antagonist ap­ <lb/>
            peared to oppose him—“ You shall have," said Hydaspes, <lb/>
            “ a reward quite in character;” and he ordered an old and <lb/>
            very bulky elephant to bo brought out and given to him.</p>
          <p>The man was pleased with, and vain of the present; but <lb/>
            the people burst into a shout of laughter; delighted at the <lb/>
            humour of the king; consoling themselves by their derision <lb/>
            of his boastfulness, for the inferiority which they had virtu­ <lb/>
            ally expressed.</p>
          <p>The ambassadors of the Seres came next. They brought <lb/>
            spun and woven garments, both white and purple; the ma­ <lb/>
            terials of which were the produce of an insect,† which is <lb/>
            bred in their country. These gifts being accepted, they <lb/>
            begged and obtained the release of certain prisoners who had <lb/>
            been condemned.</p>
          <p>After them, the envoys from Arabia the Happy approached. <lb/>
            They presented many talents worth of fragrant leaves, <lb/>
            lavender, cinnamon, and other productions, with which that <lb/>
            land of perfume abounds; all which filled the air around <lb/>
            with an agreeable odour.</p>
          <p>Then appeared the Troglodites. They brought gold dust <lb/>
            (which is turned up by the ant-eater‡), also a pair of hippo­ <lb/>
            grins guided by golden reins.</p>
          <p>The ambassadors of the Blemmyæ offered bows and arrows, <lb/>
            formed of serpents' bones, and disposed into the form of a <lb/>
            crown. <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὕτως ὠγύγιος</foreign>. See the description and bearing of Dares.— <lb/>

          <p>“ These our presents," said they,“ in value fall far behind <lb/>
            those of others; nevertheless, they did good service against <lb/>
            the Persians, at the river, as you yourself can testify."</p>
          <p>" Thev are of more value," said Hydaspes, “than other <lb/>
            costly gifts, and are the cause of my now receiving other pre­ <lb/>
            sents —at the same time he bid them declare their wishes. <lb/>
            They requested some diminution of their tributes, and ob­ <lb/>
            tained a full remission of them for ten years. When almost <lb/>
            all the ambassadors had been admitted, and had been pre­ <lb/>
            sented, some with rewards equal to their gifts, others with <lb/>
            such as were far greater, at last the ambassadors of the <lb/>
            Axiomitæ appeared. These were not tributaries, but allies: <lb/>
            they came to express their satisfaction at the king's success, <lb/>
            and brought with them their presents; and among the rest <lb/>
            there was an animal of a very uncommon and wonderful <lb/>
            kind: his size approached to that of a camel! his skin was <lb/>
            marked over with florid spots: his hind-quarters were low <lb/>
            and lionsbaped: but his fore legs, his shoulders, and breast, <lb/>
            were far higher in proportion than his other parts; his neck <lb/>
            was slender, towering up from his large body into a swanlike <lb/>
            throat, and his head, like that of a camel, was about twice <lb/>
            as large as that of a Lybian ostrich ; his eyes were very <lb/>
            bright and rolled with a fierce expression; his manner of <lb/>
            moving was different from that of every other land or water <lb/>
            animal; he did not use his legs alternately, one on each <lb/>
            side at once, but moved both those on the right together, <lb/>
            and then, in like manner, both those on the left; one side <lb/>
            at a time being raised before the other; and yet so docile in <lb/>
            movement and gentle in disposition was he, that his keeper <lb/>
            led him by a thin cord fastened round his neck; his master's <lb/>
            will having over him the influence of an irresistible chain. <lb/>
            At the appearance of this animal the multitude were asto­ <lb/>
            nished; and extemporising his name - from the principal <lb/>
            features in his figure, they called him a camelopard.t He <lb/>
            was, however, the occasion of no small confusion in the <lb/>
            assembly. There happened to stand near the altar of the <lb/>
            Moon a pair of bulls, and by that of the Sun four white <lb/>
            horses, prepared for sacrifice. At the sudden sight of this <figure type="illustration">

              strange outlandish beast, seen for the first time, terrified <lb/>
              as if they had beheld some phantom, one of the bulls, and <lb/>
              two of the horses, bursting from the ropes of those who <lb/>
              held them, galloped wildly away. They were unable to <lb/>
              break through the circle of the soldiery, fortified as it was <lb/>
              with a wall of locked shields; but running in wild disorder <lb/>
              through the middle space, they overturned vessels and vic­ <lb/>
              tims—everything, in short, that came in their way; so that <lb/>
              mingled cries arose, some of fear in those towards whom the <lb/>
              animals were making; some of mirth for the accidents which <lb/>
              happened to others whom they saw fallen and trampled <lb/>
              upon. Persina and her daughter, upon this, could not <lb/>
              remain quiet in their tent; but gently drawing aside the <lb/>
              curtain they became spectators of what was done.</p>
          <p>But now Theagenes, whether excited by his own cour­ <lb/>
            ngeous spirit, or by the inspiration of the gods, observing <lb/>
            t he keepers who were placed around him dispersed in the <lb/>
            t umult, rose from his knees, in which which posture he had <lb/>
            placed himself before the altar, awaiting his approaching <lb/>
            sacrifice ; and seizing a piece of cleft wood, many of which lay <lb/>
            prepared for the ceremony, he leaped upon one of the horses <lb/>
            who had not burst his bands; and grasping the mane with <lb/>
            one hand, and using it for a bridle, with his heel (as with a <lb/>
            spur) and the billet he urged on the courser, and pursued, <lb/>
            on full speed, one of the flying bulls.</p>
          <p>At first, those present supposed it an attempt of Thea­ <lb/>
            genes to escape in the confusion, and called out not to <lb/>
            let him pass the ring of soldiers; but they soon had reason <lb/>
            to be convinced that it was not the effect of fear or dread of <lb/>
            being sacrificed. He quickly overtook the bull and followed <lb/>
            him for some time close behind, fatiguing him, and urging <lb/>
            on his course, pursuing him in all his doublings, and if he <lb/>
            endeavoured to turn and make at him, avoiding him with <lb/>
            wonderful dexterity. When he had made the animal a little <lb/>
            familiar with his presence and his movements, he galloped <lb/>
            up close by his side, actually touching him, mingling the <lb/>
            breath and sweat of both animals, and so equalizing their <lb/>
            courses, that they who were at a distance might imagine <lb/>
            their heads had grown together. Every one extolled Thea­ <lb/>
            genes who had found means to join together this strange <lb/>
            hippotaurine pair.* While the multitude was intent upon, <note type="footnote"> * Suetonius mentions an exploit similar to this of Theagenes, and </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            and diverted with this spectacle, Chariclea was agitated, and <lb/>
            trembled. She knew not what was the object of Theagenes; <lb/>
            should he fall and be wounded it would be death to her; <lb/>
            her emotion, in short, was such that it could not escape the <lb/>
            observation of Persina.</p>
          <p>“My child," said she, “what is the matter with you? <lb/>
            You seem very anxious about this stranger. I feel some <lb/>
            concern for him myself, and pity his youth. I hope he will <lb/>
            escape the danger to which he has exposed himself, and be <lb/>
            preserved for the sacrifice; lest all the honours which we <lb/>
            meant to pay the gods, should be found failing and deficient."</p>
          <p>it Yours is strange compassion," replied Chariclea, " to <lb/>
            wish that he may avoid one death, in order that he may <lb/>
            suffer a worse. But if it be possible, O my mother! save <lb/>
            this young man for my sake.”</p>
          <p>Persina not understanding the real case, but suspecting <lb/>
            that love had some share in it, said, " This is impossible; <lb/>
            but let me know the nature of your connection with this <lb/>
            youth, in whom you seem to take so great an interest. <lb/>
            Open your mind with freedom and confidence, and recollect <lb/>
            that you are speaking to a mother. Even if giving way to <lb/>
            any youthful weakness, you have felt more for this stranger <lb/>
            than perhaps a maiden ought to own, a parent knows how <lb/>
            to excuse the failings of a daughter; and a woman can throw <lb/>
            a cloak over the frailties of her sex."</p>
          <p>" This too is my additional misfortune," replied Cha­ <lb/>
            riclea ; “ I am speaking * to those of understanding, yet I <lb/>
            am not understood. While speaking of my own misfor­ <lb/>
            tunes, I am not supposed to speak of them. I must enter <lb/>
            then upon a 'plain unvarnished' accusation of myself <lb/>
            She was preparing to declare everything which related to her <lb/>
            situation and connections, when she was interrupted by a <lb/>
            sudden and loud shout from the multitude; for Theagenes, <lb/>
            after urging his horse at its swiftest speed and getting even <lb/>
            with the bull's head, suddenly leaping from the animal <lb/>
            (which he allowed to run loose) threw himself on the bull's <lb/>
            neck. He placed his face between his horns, closely em­</p>
          <p>performed by a Thessalian, as be was (Claud. cap. 21). " Præterea <lb/>
            Thessalos equites qui feros tauros per spatia circi agunt, insiliuntque <lb/>
            defessos, et ad terrain cornibus detrahunt.” The above exploit was <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυροκαθαίρια</foreign>. It is represented in one of the Arundel <lb/>
            marbles. <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="252"/>
              braced his forehead with his arms (as with a chaplet), <lb/>
              clasped his fingers in front, and letting his body fall on the <lb/>
              beast's right shoulder, sustained his bounds, and shocks <lb/>
              with little hurt. When he perceived him to be fatigued <lb/>
              with his weight, and that his muscles began to be relaxed <lb/>
              and yield, just as he passed by the place where Hydaspes <lb/>
              sat, he shifted his body to the front, entangled his legs with <lb/>
              chose of the bull, continuously kicking him and hindering <lb/>
              his progress. The beast being thus impeded, and borne <lb/>
              down at the same time by the weight and force of the youth, <lb/>
              trips and tumbles upon his head, rolls upon his back, and <lb/>
              there lies supine, his horns deeply imbedded in the ground, <lb/>
              and his legs quivering in the air, testifying to his defeat. <lb/>
              Theagenes kept him down with his left hand, and waved his <lb/>
              right towards Hydaspes and the multitude, inviting them, <lb/>
              with a smiling and cheerful countenance, to take part in his <lb/>
              rejoicing, while the bellowings of the bull served instead of <lb/>
              a trumpet to celebrate his triumph. The applause of the <lb/>
              multitude was expressed not so much by articulate words, <lb/>
              as by a shout, giving open-mouthed token of their wonder­ <lb/>
              ment, and with its sounds extolling him to the very skies. <lb/>
              By order of Hydaspes, Theagenes was brought before him, <lb/>
              and the bull, by a rope tied over his horns, was led back <lb/>
              weak and dispirited towards the altar, where they again <lb/>
              fastened him, together with the horse which had escaped. <lb/>
              The king was preparing to speak to Theagenes, when the <lb/>
              multitude, interested in him from the first, and now de­ <lb/>
              lighted with this instance of his strength and courage, <lb/>
              but still more moved with jealousy towards the foreign <lb/>
              wrestler, called out with one voice—“ Let him be matched <lb/>
              with Marœbus's champion. Let him who has received the <lb/>
              elephant contend, if he dare, with him who has subdued the <lb/>
              bull." They pressed and insisted on this so long, till at <lb/>
              length they extorted the consent of Hydaspes. The fellow <lb/>
              was called out: he advanced, casting around fierce and con­ <lb/>
              temptuous looks, stepping haughtily, dilating his chest, and <lb/>
              swinging his arms with insolent defiance.. When he came <lb/>
              near the royal tent, Hydaspes looking at Theagenes, said to <note type="footnote"> * ... .“ caput altum in prælia tollit, <lb/>
              Ostenditque humeros latos, alternaque jactat, <lb/>

              him in Greek-" The people are desirous that you should <lb/>
              engage with this man, you must therefore do so."</p>
          <p>“ Be it as they please," replied Theagenes. “ But what is <lb/>
            to be the nature of the contest ?”—” Wrestling," said the <lb/>
            king.—“ Why not with swords, and in armour ?" returned <lb/>
            the other, “ that either by my fall or by my victory I may <lb/>
            satisfy Chariclea, who persists in concealing everything <lb/>
            which relates to our connection, or perhaps at last has cast <lb/>
            me off."</p>
          <p>" Why you thus bring in the name of Chariclea," replied <lb/>
            Hydaspes, "you best know; but you must wrestle, and not <lb/>
            fight with swords, for no blood must be shed on this day, <lb/>
            but at the altar." Theagenes perceived the king's appre­ <lb/>
            hension lest he should fall before the sacrifice, and said, <lb/>
            " You do well, 0 king, to reserve me for the gods; they too, <lb/>
            you may be assured, will watch over my preservation." So <lb/>
            saying, taking up a handful of dust, he sprinkled it over <lb/>
            his limbs, already dropping with sweat, from his exertions <lb/>
            in pursuit of the bull. He shook off all which did not <lb/>
            adhere; and stretching out his arms, planting his feet firmly, <lb/>
            bending his knees a little, rounding his back and shoulders, <lb/>
            throwing back his neck, and contracting all his muscles, he <lb/>
            stood anxiously waiting the gripe of his antagonist. The <lb/>
            Ethiopian seeing him, grimly smiled, and by his contemp­ <lb/>
            tuous gestures seemed to slight his adversary.</p>
          <p>Making a rush he let fall his arm, like some mighty bar, <lb/>
            upon the neck of Theagenes—at the echo which it made <lb/>
            the braggart laughed exultingly. Theagenes, trained in <lb/>
            the wrestling-school tricks from his youth, and familiar <lb/>
            with all the tricks of the Mercurial art* determined to give <lb/>
            ground at first, and having made trial of his adversary, not <lb/>
            to stand up against such tremendous weight and savage <lb/>
            ferocity, but to elude his undisciplined strength by skill <lb/>
            and subtlety. Staggering back, then, a little from his place <lb/>
            he affected to suffer more than he really did, and exposed <lb/>
            the other side of his neck to his opponent's blow; and when <lb/>
            the African planted another hit in that quarter, purposely <lb/>
            giving way, he pretended almost to be falling upon his <note type="footnote"> * “ Mercuri, facunde nepos Atlantic <lb/>

            face. But when waxing stronger in contempt and con­ <lb/>
            fidence, his antagonist was now a third time, unguardedly <lb/>
            rushing on, and about to let fall his upraised arm, Theagenes <lb/>
            got within his guard, eluding his blow by a sudden twist, <lb/>
            and with his right elbow struck up the other's left arm, and <lb/>
            dashed him to the earth, already impelled downwards by <lb/>
            the sway of his own missed blow; then slipping his hand <lb/>
            under his armpits, he got upon his back, and with difficulty <lb/>
            spanning his brawny waist, incessantly kicked his feet and <lb/>
            ancles, and compelled him to rise upon his knees, strode <lb/>
            over him, pressed him in the groin with his legs, struck <lb/>
            from under him tho support of his hands, and twining his <lb/>
            arms about his temples, dragged his head back upon his <lb/>
            shoulders, and so stretched him with his belly on the ground. If.</p>
          <p>An universal shout of applause, greater than before, now <lb/>
            burst from the multitude; nor could the king contain him­ <lb/>
            self, but springing from his throne-" 0 hateful necessity," <lb/>
            he cried, " what a hero of a man are we compelled to sacri­ <lb/>
            fice !" and calling him to him he said, " Young man, it now <lb/>
            remains for you to be crowned for the altar, according to <lb/>
            our custom. You have deserved a crown too for your <lb/>
            glorious but useless victory, and transitory triumph; and <lb/>
            though it be out of my power, however willing I may be, to <lb/>
            preserve your life, whatever I can do for you I will. If <lb/>
            therefore there is any thing you wish to have done, either <lb/>
            before or after your death, ask it freely." So saying he took <lb/>
            a crown of gold, set with precious stones, and put it on his <lb/>
            head ; and, while he placed it there, was seen to shed tears.</p>
          <p>“ I have but one thing to ask," said Theagenes, " and <lb/>
            this I earnestly beseech you that I may obtain. If it <lb/>
            be impossible for me to avoid being sacrified, grant that <lb/>
            I may suffer by the hands of this your newly recovered <lb/>
            daughter."</p>
          <p>Hydaspes was annoyed at this reply, and called to mind <lb/>
            the conformity of this request to that made just before <lb/>
            by Chariclea; but, as the time pressed, ho did not think <lb/>
            it necessary to inquire particularly into tho reasons of <lb/>
            it, and only said, “ Whatever is possible, Stranger! I en­ <lb/>

            but she, who performs the sacrifice the law distinctly <lb/>
            declares, must be one who has a husband, not a maiden."</p>
          <p>" Chariclea has a husband," said Theagenes.—“ These <lb/>
            are the words," replied Hydaspes, “ of one who trifles and <lb/>
            is about to die. The altar has declared her unmarried and a <lb/>
            virgin-unless indeed you call this Merœbus her husband <lb/>
            (having somehow heard the rumour); he however is not yet <lb/>
            her husband—he is yet in accordance with my will, only her <lb/>
            intended."</p>
          <p>" Nor will be ever be her husband said Theagenes, “ if <lb/>
            I know aught of Chariclea's sentiments; and, if being a <lb/>
            victim, credit is due to mo as inspired by prophecy.”—“ But, <lb/>
            fair Sir," said Merœbus, " it is not living but slaughtered <lb/>
            victims which afford knowledge to the Seers. You are <lb/>
            right, Sire, in saying that the stranger talks folly, and <lb/>
            like one just about to die. Command, therefore, that he be <lb/>
            led to the altar; and when you shall have finished all your <lb/>
            business, begin the rites, I pray you."</p>
          <p>Theagenes was being led away ; and Chariclea, who had <lb/>
            breathed again when he was victorious, was once more. <lb/>
            plunged into grief, when she saw it had profited him <lb/>
            nothing. Persina observed her tears, and feeling for her <lb/>
            affliction, said—“ It is possible I may yet have power to <lb/>
            save this Grecian, if you will explain more clearly all the <lb/>
            particulars relating to yourself."</p>
          <p>Chariclea, who saw that there was not a moment to be <lb/>
            lost, was a second time preparing to own everything; when <lb/>
            Hydaspes inquiring from the lord in waiting whether any <lb/>
            ambassadors remained who had not had audience, was told <lb/>
            only those from Syene, who were that instant arrived, with <lb/>
            letters from Oroondates, and presents. " Let them too <lb/>
            approach, and execute theircommission," said the mon­ <lb/>
            arch. They were introduced, and delivered letters to this <lb/>
            effect :­</p>
          <p>“ Oroondates, Viceroy of the Great King, to Hydaspes, <lb/>
            the king of Æthiopia.</p>
          <p>“ Since conqueror in fight, you are yet more conqueror in <lb/>
            magnanimity, in restoring to me a viceroyalty unasked, I <lb/>
            have little doubt that I shall obtain a slight request. A <lb/>
            young maiden who was being conducted from Memphis to <lb/>
            my camp, became involved in the perils of war, and as I <lb/>
            am informed, was sent by you into Æthiopia. This I have <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            learnt from those who were with her and who escaped: <lb/>
            I beg she may be sent to me, both on account of the <lb/>
            maiden herself, as well as for her father's sake, who, after <lb/>
            having wandered over half the globe, in search of his <lb/>
            daughter, came at last to Elephantine, and was taken pri. <lb/>
            Boner by the garrison. When reviewing those of my sol­ <lb/>
            diers who survived, I saw him and he earnestly desired to <lb/>
            be sent to your clemency. He is among the ambassadors, <lb/>
            his manners and bearing shew him to be of noble birth, and <lb/>
            his very countenance and looks speak strongly in his favour. <lb/>
            Dismiss him then, 0 king, I beseech you, happy and con­ <lb/>
            tented from your presence. Send back to me one who is a <lb/>
            father not merely in name but in reality.”</p>
          <p>Hydaspes, having read the letter, inquired who it was, <lb/>
            who was come in quest of his daughter. When he was <lb/>
            pointed out to him, he said, " I am ready, stranger, to do <lb/>
            every thing which Oroondates requests of me. Out of the <lb/>
            ten captive maidens whom we have brought hither, one <lb/>
            assuredly is not your daughter; examine the rest, and if <lb/>
            she be found among them take her."</p>
          <p>The old man, falling down, kissed his feet. The maidens <lb/>
            were brought, and passed in review before him; but when <lb/>
            he saw not her whom he sought, he said sorrowfully— <lb/>
            " None of these, 0 king, is my daughter.”—“ You have my <lb/>
            good will in your behalf," replied Hydaspes. " You must <lb/>
            blame Fortune if you have not discovered your child. It is <lb/>
            in your power to search, if you will, through the camp ; and <lb/>
            to ascertain that none else has been brought hither besides <lb/>
            these."</p>
          <p>The old man smote his forehead, and wept; and, then <lb/>
            after raising his eyes, and looking round him, he suddenly <lb/>
            sprang forward, like one distracted; and upon coming to <lb/>
            the altar, he twisted the end of his long robe into the form <lb/>
            of a halter, threw it over the neck of Theagenes, and pulled <lb/>
            him towards him, crying out—“ I have found you, my <lb/>
            enemy ! I have found you, man of blood, detested wretch!" <lb/>
            -The guards interposed, and endeavoured to resist and <lb/>
            pull him away, but keeping a firm hold and clinging closely <lb/>
            to him, be succeeded in bringing him before Hydaspes and <lb/>
            the council.</p>
          <p>" This, O king," said he, “ is the man who stole away my <lb/>
            daughter. This is he who has rendered my house childless <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            and desolate; who, after ravishing away my daughter from <lb/>
            the midst of Apollo's altar, now sits as though he were <lb/>
            holy beside the altars of the gods."</p>
          <p>The assembly was thrown into commotion at what was <lb/>
            taking place. They did not understand what he said, but <lb/>
            wondered at what they saw him do; and Hydaspes com­ <lb/>
            manded him to explain himself more plainly, and say what <lb/>
            he would have; when the old man (it was Charicles), con­ <lb/>
            cealing the true circumstances of the birth and exposure <lb/>
            of Chariclea, lest, if she should have perished in her flight <lb/>
            or journey, he might come into some collision with her rea <lb/>
            parents, explained briefly such matters as could produce n- <lb/>
            ill results.</p>
          <p>" I had a daughter, 0 king! and had you seen her various <lb/>
            and uncommon perfections, both of mind and person, you <lb/>
            would say I have good cause for speaking as I do. She <lb/>
            lived the life of a virgin, a priestess of Diana, in the temple <lb/>
            at Delphi. This noble Thessalian, forsooth, who was sent <lb/>
            by his country to preside over a solemn embassy and sacri­ <lb/>
            fice to be celebrated in our holy city, stole her away from <lb/>
            the very shrine, I say, of Apollo.</p>
          <p>" Justly may he be considered to have insulted you by <lb/>
            profaning your national deity Apollo and his temple, Apollo <lb/>
            being identical with the Sun. His assistant in this impious <lb/>
            outrage was a pretended priest of Memphis. In my pur­ <lb/>
            suit, I came to Thessaly; and the Thessalians offered to <lb/>
            give him up should he be found as one accursed and <lb/>
            deserving death. Thinking it probable that Calasiris might <lb/>
            have chosen Memphis as a placo of refuge, I hastened <lb/>
            thither. Calasiris, I found, was dead; but I learnt all <lb/>
            particulars concerning my daughter from his son Thyamis, <lb/>
            who told me that she had been sent to Oroondates at <lb/>
            Syene. After being disappointed at not finding the latter <lb/>
            at Syene, and having been myself detained prisoner at Ele­ <lb/>
            phantis, I now appear before you as a suppliant, to seek my <lb/>
            child. You will, then, deeply oblige me, a man of many <lb/>
            griefs, and will also gratify your own self, by not disre­ <lb/>
            garding the Viceroy's intercession." He ceased, and burst <lb/>
            into tears.</p>
          <p>The king asked Theagenes what reply he had to make <lb/>
            to all this. " The whole charge," said he, " is true. To <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            this man I have been a ravisher, unjust, and violent; but <lb/>
            to you I have been a benefactor.”—“ Restore, then, another’s <lb/>
            daughter," said Hydaspes. “ You have been dedicated to <lb/>
            the gods; let your death be a holy and glorious sacrifice­ <lb/>
            not the just punishment of crime."</p>
          <p>" Not he who committed the violence, It said Theagenes; <lb/>
            “ but he who reaps the fruits of it, is bound to make <lb/>
            restitution. Do you then restore Chariclea, for she is in <lb/>
            your possession. The old man, you shall see, will own your <lb/>
            daughter to bo her whom ho seeks."</p>
          <p>None could repress their emotion: all were in confusion. <lb/>
            But Sisimithres, who had hitherto kept silence, though <lb/>
            long since understanding all that was being said and done, <lb/>
            yet waiting till the circumstances should become yet clearer, <lb/>
            now ran up and embraced Chariclos. “ Your adopted <lb/>
            child," said he, it she whom I formerly delivered into your <lb/>
            hands, is safe: she is, and has been acknowledged to be, <lb/>
            the daughter of those whom you know."</p>
          <p>Upon this Chariclea rushed out of the tent, and over­ <lb/>
            looking all restraints of sex or maidenly reserve, flung <lb/>
            herself at the feet of Charicles, and cried out, “ 0 ray father! <lb/>
            O not less revered than the authors of my birth, punish <lb/>
            me, your cruel and ungrateful daughter, as you think fit, <lb/>
            regardless of my only excuse, that what has been done was <lb/>
            ordained by the irresistible will and appointment of the <lb/>
            gods." Persina, on the other side, threw her arms round <lb/>
            Hydaspes, and said, " My dear husband, be assured that <lb/>
            all this is truth, and that this stranger Greek is her <lb/>
            betrothed." • The people, on the other hand, leaped and <lb/>
            danced for joy; every ago and condition were, without <lb/>
            exception, delighted-not understanding, indeed, the greater <lb/>
            part of what was said, but conjecturing the facts from what <lb/>
            had taken place with Chariclea. Perhaps, too, they were <lb/>
            brought to a comprehension of the truth by some secret <lb/>
            influence of the deity, who had ordered all these events so <lb/>
            dramatically, producing out of the greatest discords the <lb/>
            most perfect harmony: joy out of grief; smiles from tears ; <lb/>
            out of a stem spectacle a gladsome feast; laughter from <lb/>
            weeping; rejoicing out of mourning; the finding* of those <lb/>
            who were not sought; the losing† of those who were in <note type="footnote"> By Hydaspes. </note> <note type="footnote"> t By Charicles. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            imagination found; in one word, a holy sacrifice out of an <lb/>
            anticipated * slaughter.</p>
          <p>At length Hydaspes said to Sisimithres, " 0 sage! what <lb/>
            are we to do P To defraud the gods of their victims is not <lb/>
            pious; to sacrifice those who appear to bo preserved and <lb/>
            restored by their providence is impious. It needs that some <lb/>
            expedient be found out."</p>
          <p>Sisimithres, speaking, not in the Grecian, but in the <lb/>
            Ethiopian tongue, so as to bo heard by the greatest part of <lb/>
            tho assembly, replied: " 0 king ! the wisest among men, as <lb/>
            it appears, often have tho understanding clouded through <lb/>
            excess of ioN,, else, before this time, you would have discovered <lb/>
            that the gods regard not with favour tho sacrifice which you <lb/>
            have been preparing for them. First they, from the very <lb/>
            altar, declared the all-blessed Chariclea to be your daughter; <lb/>
            next they brought her foster-father most wonderfully from <lb/>
            the midst of Greece to this spot; they struck panic and <lb/>
            terror into the horses and oxen which were being prepared <lb/>
            for sacrifice, indicating, perhaps, by that event, that those <lb/>
            whom custom considered as the more perfect and fitting <lb/>
            victims were to be rejected. Now, as the consummation of <lb/>
            all good, as the perfection of the piece,! they show this <lb/>
            Grecian youth to be the betrothed husband of the maiden. <lb/>
            Let us give credence to these proofs of the divine and <lb/>
            wonder-working will; let us be fellow workers with this <lb/>
            will; let us have recourse to holier offerings; let us abolish, <lb/>
            for ever, these detested human sacrifices."</p>
          <p>When Sisimithres had uttered this, in a loud voice, <lb/>
            Hydaspes, speaking also in the Ethiopian tongue, and <lb/>
            taking Theagcnes and Chariclea by the hand, thus pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded:— <note type="footnote"> * “Time and tide had thus their away, <lb/>

            been thus brought to pass by the will of the deities, to <lb/>
            oppose them would be impious. Wherefore, calling to <lb/>
            witness those who have woven these events into the web of <lb/>
            destiny, and you whose minds appear to be in concert with <lb/>
            them, I sanction the joining together of this pair in wed­ <lb/>
            lock and procreative union. If you approve, let a sacrifice <lb/>
            confirm this resolution, and then proceed we with the <lb/>
            sacred rites."</p>
          <p>The assembly signified their approval by a shout, and <lb/>
            clapped their hands, in token of the nuptials being ratified. <lb/>
            Hydaspes approached the altar, and, in act to begin the <lb/>
            ceremony, said, " 0 lordly Sun and queenly Moon! since by <lb/>
            your wills Theagenes and Chariclea have been declared <lb/>
            man and wife, they may now lawfully be your ministers." <lb/>
            So saying, he took off his own and Persina's mitre, the <lb/>
            symbol of the priesthood, and placed his own upon the head <lb/>
            of the youth, that of his consort upon the maiden’s head.</p>
          <p>Upon this Charicles called to mind the oracle which had <lb/>
            been given to them in the temple before their flight from <lb/>
            Delphi, and acknowledged its fulfilment. <lb/>
            In regions torrid shall arrive at last, <lb/>
            There shall the gods reward their pious vows, <lb/>
            And snowy chaplets bind their dusky browa.*</p>
          <p>The youthful pair then, crowned by Hydaspes with white <lb/>
            mitres, and invested with the dignity of priesthood, sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed under propitious omens; and, accompanied by lighted <lb/>
            torches and the sounds of pipes and flutes, Theagenes and <lb/>
            Hydaspes, Charicles and Sisimithres, in chariots drawn by <lb/>
            horses, Persina and Chariclea, in one drawn by milk white <lb/>
            oxen, were escorted, into Meröe (amidst shouts, clapping <lb/>
            of hands, and dances), there to celebrate with greater mag­ <lb/>
            nificence the more mystic portions of the nuptial rites.</p>
          <p>Thus ends the Romance of the “Ethiopics,” or Adven­ <lb/>
            tures of Theagenes and Chariclea, written by a Phœnician <lb/>

          <p>WHILE hunting in Lesbos, I saw in a grove, sacred to the <lb/>
            Nymphs, the most beautiful sight which had ever come <lb/>
            before my eyes-an historical painting,. which represented <lb/>
            the incidents of a love-story. The grove itself was beautiful, <lb/>
            abounding with trees and flowers, which received their nou­ <lb/>
            rishment from a single fountain. More delightful, however, <lb/>
            than these was the painting, displaying, as it did, great <lb/>
            skill, and representing the fortunes of Love. Because of <lb/>
            the fame of this picture, many strangers resorted thither to <lb/>
            pay their adorations to the Nymphs, and to view the <lb/>
            painting. The subjects of it were women in the throes of <lb/>
            child-birth; nurses wrapping the new-born babes in swathing <lb/>
            clothes; infants exposed; animals of the flock giving them <lb/>
            suck; shepherds carrying them away; young people pledg­ <lb/>
            ing their mutual troth; an attack by pirates ; an inroad by <lb/>
            a hostile force.</p>
          <p>As I viewed and admired these and many other things, <lb/>
            all containing love allusions, I conceived the desire of <lb/>
            writing an illustration of the piece, and having sought <lb/>
            out a person to explain the various allusions, I at length <lb/>
            completed four books,-an offering to the God of Love, <note type="footnote"> * Compare the description of the picture representing the story of <lb/>

          <p>In the island of Lesbos there is an extensive city called <lb/>
            Mitylene, the appearance of which is beautiful; the sea <lb/>
            intersects it by various canals, and it is adorned with bridges <lb/>
            of polished white stone. You might imagine you beheld an <lb/>
            island rather than a city.</p>
          <p>About twenty-four miles from Mitylene, were the posses­ <lb/>
            sions of a rich man, which formed a very fine estate. The <lb/>
            mountains abounded with game, the fields produced corn, the <lb/>
            hills were thick with vines, the pastures with herds, and the <lb/>
            sea-washed shore consisted of an extent of smooth sand.</p>
          <p>As Lamon, a goatherd, was tending his herds upon the <lb/>
            estate, he found a child suckled by a she-goat. The place <lb/>
            where it was lying was an oak coppice and tangled thicket, <lb/>
            with ivy winding about it, and soft grass beneath; thither <lb/>
            the goat continually ran and disappeared from sight, leaving <lb/>
            her own kid in order to remain near the child. Lamon <lb/>
            watched her movements, being grieved to see the kid neg­ <lb/>
            lected, and one day when the sun was burning in his meri­ <lb/>
            than heat he follows her steps and sees her standing over <lb/>
            the infant with the utmost caution, lest her hoofs might <lb/>
            injure it, while the child sucked copious draughts of her <lb/>
            milk as if from its mother's breast. Struck with natural <lb/>
            astonishment, he advances close to the spot and discovers <lb/>
            a lusty and handsome male-child, with far richer swathing <lb/>
            clothes than suited its fortune in being thus exposed; for its <lb/>
            little mantle was of fine purple, and fastened by a golden <lb/>
            clasp, and it had a little sword with a hilt of ivory.</p>
          <p>At first Lamon resolved to leave the infant to its fate, <lb/>
            and to carry off only the tokens; but feeling afterwards <lb/>
            ashamed at the reflection, that in doing so, he should be <lb/>
            inferior in humanity, even to a goat, he waited for the <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            approach of night, and then carried home the infant with <lb/>
            the tokens, and the she-goat herself to Myrtale his wife.</p>
          <p>Myrtale was astonished, and thought it strange if goats <lb/>
            could produce children, upon which her husband recounts <lb/>
            every particular; how he found the infant exposed; how it <lb/>
            was suckled; and how ashamed he felt at the idea of leaving <lb/>
            it to perish. She shared his feelings, so they agreed to con­ <lb/>
            ceal the tokens, and adopt the child as their own, com­ <lb/>
            mitting the rearing of it to the goat; and that the name <lb/>
            also might be a pastoral one they determined to call it <lb/>
            Daphnis.</p>
          <p>Two years had now elapsed, when Dry as, a neighbouring <lb/>
            shepherd, tending his flock, found an infant under similar <lb/>
            circumstances.</p>
          <p>There was a grotto. sacred to the Nymphs; it was a <lb/>
            spacious rock, concave within, convex without. The statues <lb/>
            of the Nymphs themselves were carved in stone. Their <lb/>
            feet were bare, their arms naked to the shoulder, their hair <lb/>
            falling dishevelled upon their shoulders, their vests girt about <lb/>
            the waist, a smile t sat upon their brow ; their whole sem­ <lb/>
            blance was that of a troop of dancers. The dome ‡ of the <lb/>
            grotto rose over the middle of the rock. Water, spring­ <lb/>
            ing from a fountain, formed a running stream, and a trim <lb/>
            meadow stretched its soft and abundant herbage before <lb/>
            the entrance, fed by the perpetual moisture. Within, <lb/>

            her being lost. The shepherd wishing to cure her of this <lb/>
            habit, and to bring her back to her former way of grazing, <lb/>
            twisted some green osiers into the form of a slip knot, and <lb/>
            approached the rock with the view of seizing her. Upon <lb/>
            arriving there, however, he beheld a sight far contrary to <lb/>
            his expectation. He found his ewe affectionately offering <lb/>
            from her udder copious draughts of milk to an infant, which <lb/>
            without any wailing, eagerly turned from one teat to the <lb/>
            other its clean and glossy face, the animal licking it, as soon <lb/>
            as it had had its fill.</p>
          <p>This child was a female: and had beside its swathing <lb/>
            garments, by way of tokens, a head-dress wrought with gold, <lb/>
            gilt sandals, and golden * anklets.</p>
          <p>Dryas imagining that this foundling was a gift from the <lb/>
            Deity, and instructed by his sheep to pity and love the <lb/>
            infant, raised her in his arms, placed the tokens in his <lb/>
            scrip, and prayed the Nymphs that their favour might <lb/>
            attend upon hint in bringing up their suppliant; and when <lb/>
            the time was come for driving his cattle from their pasture, <lb/>
            he returns to his cottage, relates what he had seen to his <lb/>
            wife, exhibits what he had found, urges her to observe a <lb/>
            secrecy, and to regard and rear the child as her own <lb/>
            daughter.</p>
          <p>Nape (for so his wife was called) immediately became a <lb/>
            mother to the infant, and felt affection towards it, fearing <lb/>
            perhaps to be outdone in tenderness by the ewe, and to <lb/>
            make appearances more probable, gave the child the pastoral <lb/>
            name of Chloe.</p>
          <p>The two children grew rapidly, and their personal ap­ <lb/>
            pearance exceeded that of ordinary rustics. Daphnis was <lb/>
            now fifteen and Chloe was his junior by two years, when <lb/>
            on the same night Lamon and Dryas had the following <note type="footnote"> *The <foreign xml:lang="grc">περισκέλις</foreign> (in Latin, Periscelis—see Her. Epist. 1. xviL 56,) <lb/>
            was an anklet or bangle, commonly worn not only by the Orientals, <lb/>
            the Egyptians, and the Greeks, but by the Roman ladies also. It is <lb/>
            frequently represented in the paintings of Greek figures on the walls • <lb/>
            of Pompeii—Dict. of Greek and Rom. Antiq. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            dream. They thought that they beheld the Nymphs Of the <lb/>
            Grotto, in which the fountain was and where Dryas found <lb/>
            the infant, presenting Daphnis and Chloe to a very saucy <lb/>
            looking and handsome boy, who had wings upon his should­ <lb/>
            ers, and a little bow and arrows in his hand. He lightly <lb/>
            touched them both with one of his shafts, and commanded <lb/>
            them henceforth to follow a pastoral life. The boy was to <lb/>
            tend goats, the girl was to have the charge of sheep.</p>
          <p>The Shepherd and Goat-herd having had this dream, <lb/>
            were grieved to think that these, their adopted children, <lb/>
            were like themselves to have the care of flocks. Their <lb/>
            dress had given promise of a better fortune, in consequence <lb/>
            of which their fare had been more delicate, and their educa­ <lb/>
            tion and accomplishments superior to those of a country <lb/>
            life.</p>
          <p>It appeared to them, however, that in the case of children <lb/>
            whom the gods had preserved, the will of the gods must <lb/>
            be obeyed; so each having communicated to the other his <lb/>
            dream, they offered a sacrifice to the “WINGED BOY, THE <lb/>
            COMPANION OF THE NYMPHS,” (for they were unacquainted <lb/>
            with his name) and sent forth the young people to their <lb/>
            pastoral employments, having first instructed them in their <lb/>
            duties; how to pasture their herds before the noon-day <lb/>
            heat, and when it was abated; at what time to lead them <lb/>
            to the stream, and afterwards to drive them home to the <lb/>
            fold; which of their sheep and goats required the crook, <lb/>
            and to which only the voice was necessary.</p>
          <p>They, on their part, received the charge as if it had been <lb/>
            some powerful sovereignty, and felt an affection for their <lb/>
            sheep and goats beyond what is usual with shepherds: <lb/>
            Chloe referring her preservation to a ewe, and Daphnis <lb/>
            remembering that a she-goat bad suckled him when he was <lb/>
            exposed.</p>
          <p>It was the beginning of spring, the flowers were in bloom <lb/>
            throughout the woods, the meadows, and the mountains; <lb/>
            there were the buzzings of the bee, the warblings of tho <lb/>
            songsters, the frolics of the lambs. The young of the flock <lb/>
            were skipping on the mountains, the bees flew humming <lb/>
            through the meadows, and the songs of the birds resounded <lb/>
            through the bushes. Seeing all things pervaded with such <lb/>
            universal joy, they, young and susceptible as they were, <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            imitated whatever they saw or heard. Hearing the carol of <lb/>
            the birds, they sang; seeing the sportive skipping of the <lb/>
            lambs, they danced ; and in imitation of the bees they <lb/>
            gathered flowers. Some they placed in their bosoms, and <lb/>
            others they wove into chaplets and carried them as offerings <lb/>
            to the Nymphs.</p>
          <p>They tended their flocks in company, and all their occu­ <lb/>
            pations were in common. Daphnis frequently collected the <lb/>
            sheep, which had strayed, and Chloe drove back from a pre­ <lb/>
            cipice the goats which were too venturesome. Sometimes one <lb/>
            would take the entire management both of goats and sheep, <lb/>
            while the other was intent upon some amusement</p>
          <p>Their sports were of a pastoral and childish kind. Chloe <lb/>
            sometimes neglected her flock and went in search of stalks <lb/>
            of asphodel, with which she wove traps. for locusts; while <lb/>
            Daphnis devoted himself to playing till nightfall upon his <lb/>
            pipe, which he had formed by cutting slender reeds, per­ <lb/>
            orating the intervals between the joints, and compacting <lb/>
            them together with soft wax. Sometimes they shared their <lb/>
            milk and wine, and made a common meal upon the provision <lb/>
            which they had brought from home ; and sooner might you <lb/>
            see one part of the flock divided from the other than Daph­ <lb/>
            nis separate from Chloe.</p>
          <p>While thus engaged in their amusements Love contrived <lb/>
            an interruption of a serious nature.! A she-wolf from the <lb/>
            neighbourhood had often carried off lambs from other shep­ <lb/>
            herds' flocks, as she required a plentiful supply of food for <lb/>
            her whelps. Upon this the villagers assembled by night <lb/>
            and dug pits in the earth, six feet wide and twenty-four feet <lb/>
            deep. The greater part of the loose earth, dug out of these <lb/>
            pits, they carried to a distance and scattered about, spreading <lb/>
            the remainder over some long dry sticks laid over the mouth <lb/>
            of the pits, so as to resemble the natural surface of the <lb/>
            ground. The sticks were weaker than straws, so that if <lb/>
            even a hare ran over them they would break and prove that <lb/>
            instead of substance there was but a show of solid earth. <lb/>
            The villagers dug many of these pits in the mountains and <lb/>
            in the plains, but they could not succeed in capturing the <note type="footnote"> * See Theoc. IdyL 1. 52.— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              wolf, which discovered the contrivance of the snare. They <lb/>
              however caused the destruction of many of their own goats <lb/>
              and sheep, and very nearly, as we shall see, that of Daphne.</p>
          <p>Two angry he-goats engaged in fight. The contest waxed <lb/>
            more and more violent, until one of them having his horn <lb/>
            broken ran away bellowing with pain. The victor followed <lb/>
            in hot and close pursuit. Daphnis, vexed to see that his <lb/>
            goat's horn was broken, and that the conqueror persevered <lb/>
            in his vengeance, seized his club and crook, and pursued the <lb/>
            pursuer.. In consequence of the former hurrying on in <lb/>
            wrath, and the latter flying in trepidation, neither of them <lb/>
            observed what lay in their path, and both fell into a pit, <lb/>
            the goat first, Dapbnis afterwards. This was the means <lb/>
            of preserving his lite, the goat serving as a support in his <lb/>
            descent. Poor Daphnis remained at the bottom lamenting <lb/>
            his sad mishap with tears, and anxiously hoping that some <lb/>
            one might pass by, and pull him out. Chloe, who had <lb/>
            observed the accident, hastened to the spot, and finding th:.t <lb/>
            he was still alive, summoned a cowherd from an adjacent <lb/>
            field to come to his assistance. He obeyed the call, but <lb/>
            upon seeking for a rope long enough to draw Daphnis out, <lb/>
            no rope was to be found: upon which Chloe undoing her <lb/>
            bead-band,† gave it to the cowherd to let down; they then <lb/>
            placed themselves at the brink of the pit, and held one end, <lb/>
            while Daphnis grasped the other with both hands, and so <lb/>
            got out.</p>
          <p>They then extricated the unhappy goat, who had both his <lb/>
            horns broken by the fall, and thus suffered a just punish­ <lb/>
            ment for his revenge towards his defeated fellow-combatant. <lb/>
            They gave him to the herdsman as a reward for his assist­ <lb/>
            ance, and if the family at home inquired after him, were <lb/>
            prepared to say that he had been destroyed by a wolf. <lb/>
            After this they returned to see whether their flocks were <lb/>
            safe, and finding both goats and sheep feeding quietly and <lb/>
            orderly, they sat down on the trunk of a tree and began to <lb/>
            examine whether Daphnis had received any wound. No <lb/>
            hurt or blood was to be seen, but his hair and all the rest of <lb/>
            his person were covered with mud and dirt. Daphnis <figure type="illustration">

              thought it would be best to wash himself, before Lamon and <lb/>
              Myrtale should find out what had happened to him; pro­ <lb/>
              ceeding with Chloe to the Grotto of the Nymphs, he gave <lb/>
              her his tunic and scrip in charge.*</p>
          <p>He then approached the fountain and washed his hair <lb/>
            and his whole person. His hair was long and black, and his <lb/>
            body sun-burnt; one might have imagined that its hue was <lb/>
            derived from the overshadowing of his locks. Chloe thought <lb/>
            him beautiful, and because she had never done so before, <lb/>
            attributed his beauty to the effects of the bath. As she was <lb/>
            washing his back and shoulders his tender flesh yielded to <lb/>
            her hand, so that, unobserved, she frequently touched her <lb/>
            own skin, in order to ascertain which of the two was softer. <lb/>
            The sun was now setting, so they drove homo their flocks, <lb/>
            the only wish in Chloe's mind being to see Daphnis bathe <lb/>
            again. The following day, upon returning to the accustomed <lb/>
            pasture, Daphnis sat as usual under an oak, playing upon <lb/>
            his pipe and surveying his goats lying down and apparently <lb/>
            listening to his strains. Chloe, on her part, sitting near him, <lb/>
            looked at her sheep, but more frequently turned her eyes <lb/>
            upon Daphnis; again he appeared to her beautiful as he was <lb/>
            playing upon his pipe, and the attributed his beauty to the <lb/>
            melody, so that taking the pipe she played upon it, in order, <lb/>
            if possible, to appear beautiful herself. She persuaded him <lb/>
            to bathe again, she looked at hint when in the bath, and <lb/>
            while looking at him, touched his skin: after which, as she <lb/>
            returned home, she mentally admired him, and this admira­ <lb/>
            tion was the beginning of love. She knew not the meaning <lb/>
            of her feelings, young as she was, and brought up in the <lb/>
            country, and never having heard from any one, so much as <lb/>
            the name of love. She felt an oppression at her heart, she <lb/>
            could not restrain her eyes from gazing upon him, nor her <lb/>
            mouth from often pronouncing his name. She took no food, <lb/>
            she lay awake at night, she neglected her flock, she laughed <lb/>
            and wept by turns; now she would doze, then suddenly start <lb/>
            up; at one moment her face became pale, in another moment <lb/>
            it burnt with blushes. Such irritation is not felt even by <note type="footnote"> * What now follows, as far as the soliloquy on Chloe's kiss, is a <lb/>
            translation of the fragment discovered by M. Courier, in the Laurentian <lb/>

            the breeze-stung heifer.. Upon one occasion, when alone, <lb/>
            she thus reasoned with herself,—“I am no doubt ill, but <lb/>
            what my malady is I know not; I am in pain, and yet I <lb/>
            have no wound; I feel grief, and yet I have lost none of my <lb/>
            flock; [ burn, and yet am sitting in the shade: how often <lb/>
            have brambles torn my skin, without my shedding a single <lb/>
            tear! how often have the bees stung me, yet I could still <lb/>
            enjoy my meals! Whatever it is which now wounds my <lb/>
            heart, must be sharper than either of these. Daphnis is <lb/>
            beautiful, so are the flowers; his pipe breathes sweetly, so <lb/>
            does the nightingale; yet I take no account either of birds <lb/>
            or flowers. Would that I could become a pipe, that he <lb/>
            might play upon me! or a goat, that I might pasture under <lb/>
            his cnre! 0 cruel fountain, thou madest Daphnis alone <lb/>
            beautiful; my bathing has been all in vain! Dear Nymphs, <lb/>
            ye see me perishing, yet neither do ye endeavour to save <lb/>
            the maiden brought up among you! Who will crown you <lb/>
            with flowers when I am gone ? Who will take care of my <lb/>
            poor lambs ? Who will attend to my chirping locust, which <lb/>
            I caught with so much trouble, that its song might lull me <lb/>
            to rest in the grotto; but now I am sleepless, because of <lb/>
            Daphnis, and my locust chirps in vain!”</p>
          <p>Such were the feelings, and such the words of Chloe, <lb/>
            while as yet ignorant of the name of love. But Dorco <lb/>
            the cowherd (the same who had drawn Daphnis and the <lb/>
            goat out of the pit), a young fellow who already boasted <lb/>
            of some beard upon his chin, and who knew not merely <lb/>
            the name but the realities of love, had become enamoured <lb/>
            of Chloe, from the first time of meeting her. Feeling <lb/>
            his passion increase day by day, and despising Daphnis, <lb/>
            whom he looked upon as a mere boy, he determined to <lb/>
            effect his purpose either by gifts or by dint of force. At <lb/>
            first he made presents to them both; he gave Daphnis a <lb/>
            shepherd's pipe, having its nine reeds† connected with metal <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig51.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> ,Esc. P. V. 681. See also Virgo G. iii. 145—151. <lb/>

              The shepherd'a pipe was in general composed of seven unequal reeds, <lb/>
              compacted with wax, and consequently was only seven-toned, <lb/>
              “ Eat mihi disparibus septem compacta cicutis <lb/>

              In lieu of wax. He presented Chloo with a fawn skin, spot­ <lb/>
              ted all over, such as is worn by the Bacchantes. Having <lb/>
              thus insinuated himself into their friendship, he by degrees <lb/>
              neglected Daphnis, but every day brought something to <lb/>
              Chloe, either a delicate cheese, or a chaplet of flowers, or a <lb/>
              ripe apple. On one occasion he brought her a mountain <lb/>
              calf, a gilt drinking cup, and the nestlings. of a wild bird. <lb/>
              She, ignorant as she was of love's artifices, received his gifts <lb/>
              with pleasure;t chiefly pleased, however, at having some­ <lb/>
              thing to give Daphnis. One day it happened that Dorco <lb/>
              und lie (tor lie likewise was destined to experience the pains <lb/>
              and penalties of love) had an argument on the subject of <lb/>
              their respective share of beauty. Chloo was to be umpire, <lb/>
              and the victor's reward was to be a kiss from her. Dorco, <lb/>
              thus began­</p>
          <p>“ Maiden," said he, " I am taller than Daphnis, I am also <lb/>
            a cowherd, he, a goatherd, I therefore excel him as far as <lb/>
            oxen are superior to goats; I am fair as milk, and my hair <lb/>
            brown as the ripe harvest field ; moreover, I had a mother to <lb/>
            bring me up, not a goat. He, on the other hand is short, <lb/>
            beardless as a woman, and has a skin as tawny as a wolf; <lb/>
            while from tending he-goats, he has contracted a goatish <lb/>
            smell; he is also so poor, that he cannot afford to keep even <lb/>
            a dog ; and if it be true that a nanny gave him suck, he is <lb/>
            no better‡ than a nanny's son."</p>
          <p>Such was Dorco's speech; it was next the turn of <lb/>
            Daphnis—</p>
          <p>" It is true," said he, " that a she-goat suckled me, and so <lb/>
            did a she-goat Buckle Jove; I tend he-goats and will bring <lb/>
            them into better condition than his oxen, but I smell of them <lb/>

          <p>Chloe could restrain herself no longer, but partly from plea­ <lb/>
            sure at his praising her, partly from a desire of kissing him, <lb/>
            she sprang forward and bestowed upon him the prize; an <lb/>
            artless and unsophisticated kiss,† but one well calculated to <lb/>
            set his heart on fire. Upon this, Dorco, in great disgust, took <lb/>
            himself off, determined to seek some other way of wooing. <lb/>
            Daphnis, as though lie had been stung instead of kissed, <lb/>
            became suddenly grave, felt a shivering all over, and could <lb/>
            not control the beating of his heart. He wished to gaze <lb/>
            upon Chloe, but at the first glance his face was suffused with <lb/>
            blushes. For the first time he admired her hair, because it <lb/>
            was auburn ; and her eyes, because they were large‡ and <lb/>
            brilliant; her countenance, because it was fairer than even <lb/>
            the milk of his own she-goats. One might have supposed <lb/>
            that he had just received the faculty of sight, having had <lb/>

              morsel, no drink beyond what would just moisten his lips. <lb/>
              Formerly more chattering than the locusts, he became mute; <lb/>
              he was now dull and listless, whereas he had been more <lb/>
              nimble than the goats. His flock was neglected, his pipe <lb/>
              was thrown aside; his face became paler than the summer- <lb/>
              parched herbage. Chloe alone could rouse his powers of <lb/>
              speech; whenever he was absent from her, he would thus <lb/>
              fondly soliloquize:— <lb/>
              " What will be the result of this kiss of Chloe ? her <lb/>
              lips are softer than rose-buds, and her mouth is sweeter <lb/>
              than the honeycomb, but this kiss has left a sting sharper <lb/>
              than the sting of a bee!—I have frequently kissed the kids, <lb/>
              and tho young puppies, and the calf which Dorco gave <lb/>
              me, but this kiss of Chloo is something quite new and <lb/>
              wonderful! My breath is gone, my heart pants, my spirit <lb/>
              sinks within me and dies away; and yet I wish to kiss <lb/>
              again !# My victory has been the source of sorrow and of <lb/>
              a new disease, which I know not how to name. Could <lb/>
              Chloe have tasted poison beforo sho permitted mo to kiss <lb/>
              her ? If so, how is it that she survives ? How sweetly the <lb/>
              nightingales sing, while my pipe is mute! How gaily the <lb/>
              kids skip and play, while I sit listlessly by! The flowers <lb/>
              are in full beauty, yet I weave no garlands! The violets <lb/>
              and the hyacinths are blooming, while Daphnis droops and <lb/>
              fades away. Alas! shall Dorco ever appear more beautiful <lb/>
              in Chloe's eyes, than I do!</p>
          <p>Such were the sensations of the worthy Daphnis, and <lb/>
            thus he vented his feelings. He now first felt the power, <lb/>
            and now first uttered the language Of-LOVE.</p>
          <p>In the mean time Dorco, the cowherd, who entertained a <lb/>
            passion for Chloe, watched an opportunity of addressing <lb/>
            Dryas on the subject; and finding him one day employed <lb/>
            in planting a tree near one of his vines, he approached <figure type="illustration">

              carrying with him some fine cheeses.* First of all he <lb/>
              begged Dryas to accept of the cheeses as a present from an <lb/>
              old acquaintance and fellow herdsman; and then informed <lb/>
              him of the affection which he cherished towards his daughter <lb/>
              Chloe. He promised that, if he should be so happy as <lb/>
              to obtain her for his wife, he was prepared to offer him <lb/>
              gifts, many and handsome, as a cowherd could bestow,-a <lb/>
              yoke of oxen fit for the plough, four hives of bees, fifty <lb/>
              young apple trees for planting, the hide of an ox, suitable <lb/>
              for shoe leather, and a weaned calf annually.</p>
          <p>Dryas was almost tempted by these promises to give his <lb/>
            assent to the marriage; but on the other hand, reflecting <lb/>
            that the maiden was deserving of a better match, and fearing <lb/>
            least if ever discovered, he might get himself into great <lb/>
            trouble, he refused his assent, at the same time intreating <lb/>
            Dorco not to be affronted, and declining to accept the gifts <lb/>
            which he had enumerated.</p>
          <p>Dorco being thus a second time disappointed of his hope, <lb/>
            and having given his cheese away to no purpose, conceived <lb/>
            a plan of attacking Chloe by force, whenever he should find <lb/>
            her alone; and having observed that she and Daphnis, on <lb/>
            alternate days, conducted the herds to drink, he contrived <lb/>
            a scheme, worthy of a neatherd's brain. A large wolf had <lb/>
            been killed by his bull, who fought in defence of the herd; <lb/>
            Dorco t threw this wolfs skin over him, so that it corn. <lb/>
            pletely covered his back, reaching to the ground, and he <lb/>
            adjusted it in such a manner, that the skins of the fore <lb/>
            feet were fitted over his hands, while those of the hind feet <lb/>
            spread down his legs to the very heels. The head, with its <lb/>
            gaping jaws, encased him as completely as a soldier's helmet.</p>
          <p>Having thus "be-wolfed" himself as much as possible, he <lb/>
            withdrew to the spring, where the sheep and goats usually <lb/>
            drank as they returned from pasture. The spring was in <note type="footnote"> * The reading in Courier'is edition, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετὰ τυρίσκων τινω̃ν γενικω̃ν</foreign>, <lb/>

              a hollow, and around it the furze, brambles, junipers, and <lb/>
              thistles were so think, that a real wolf might easily choose <lb/>
              it as a lair. Here Dorco concealed himself, and anxiously <lb/>
              waited for the time when the flocks should come to drink, <lb/>
              and when Chloe, as he hoped, would be so startled and <lb/>
              terrified by his appearance that he might easily seize her.</p>
          <p>He had not remained long, when Chloe conducted the <lb/>
            flock to the spring, leaving Daphnis employed in cutting <lb/>
            green leaves as fodder for the kids in the evening. The <lb/>
            dogs (the guardians of the sheep and goats) accompanied <lb/>
            Chloe, and scenting* about with their usual sagacity, dis­ <lb/>
            covered Dorco, who was in the act of moving. Taking him <lb/>
            for a wolf they burst into full cry, rushed upon him, and <lb/>
            seizing him before he could recover from his astonishment, <lb/>
            fixed their teeth in the skin. This covering for a time <lb/>
            protected him, and the shame of a discovery operated so <lb/>
            strongly that he lay quiet in the thicket; but when Chloe, <lb/>
            in her alarm at the first onset of the dogs, had called <lb/>
            Daphnis to her aid, and when the skin was torn off by his <lb/>
            assailants, so that they at length seized his flesh, he bawled <lb/>
            out, entreating the assistance of the maiden and of Daphnis, <lb/>
            who had now arrived at the spot. The dogs were easily ap­ <lb/>
            peased by the well-known voices of their master and mis­ <lb/>
            tress, who took Dorco and conveyed him to the spring <lb/>
            (soundly bitten in the thighs and shoulders), where they <lb/>
            washed his wounds, and chewing some fresh elm bark spread <lb/>
            it as a salve. Innocent themselves, and totally ignorant <lb/>
            of the desperate enterprizes of lovers, they imagined that <lb/>
            Dorco's disguise was a mere piece of rustic sport, and, so <lb/>
            far from being angry with him, they did their best to <lb/>
            comfort him, led him by the band, part of the way home <lb/>
            —and bade him farewell.</p>
          <p>Dorco, after his narrow escape from the dog's, and not <lb/>
            (according to the old adage) from the wolfs mouth, retired <lb/>
            home to nurse his wounds. Daphnis and Chloe had great <lb/>
            trouble during the remainder of the day in collecting their <lb/>
            sheep and goats, which, terrified at the sight of the wolf, <lb/>
            and by the barking of the dogs, had fled in different <lb/>
            directions: some had climbed the rocks, others had run <lb/>
            down to the shore. They had, indeed, been instructed <note type="footnote"> * “ odora canum vis.”—Virg. Æn. iv. 132. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            to obey their master's call; in any alarm the pipe was <lb/>
            usually sufficient to soothe them, and if they were scat­ <lb/>
            tered, a clapping of the hands would collect them; but <lb/>
            the late sudden alarm had made them forget their former <lb/>
            discipline, so that Daphnis and Chloe were compelled to <lb/>
            track them, as they do hares; and with much difficulty and <lb/>
            trouble they brought them back to their cottages. That night <lb/>
            only the young man and maiden enjoyed sound sleep, their <lb/>
            fatigue furnishing a remedy for the pains of love. But <lb/>
            with the morning their usual sensations returned. When <lb/>
            they met,-they rejoiced; when they parted,-they were <lb/>
            sad. They pined with grief. They wished for a something, <lb/>
            but they knew not what. This only they were aware of, <lb/>
            that the one had lost peace of mind by a kiss, the other by <lb/>
            a bath.</p>
          <p>The season,. moreover, added fuel to their fire; it was now <lb/>
            the end of spring; the summer had begun, and all things <lb/>
            were in the height of their beauty. The trees were covered <lb/>
            with fruit; the fields with corn. Charming was the chirp <lb/>
            of the grasshoppers; sweet was the smell of the fruit; and <lb/>
            the bleating of the flocks was delightful. You might fancy <lb/>
            the rivers t to be singing, as they gently flowed along, the <lb/>
            winds to be piping, as they breathed ‡ through the pines; <lb/>
            and the apples to be falling to the ground, sick of love; <lb/>
            and that the sun, fond of gazing upon natural beauty, was <lb/>
            forcing every one to throw off their garments. Daphnis <note type="footnote"> * “ Flush’d by the spirit of the genial year, <lb/>

              circles around him; and sometimes he drank of the stream, <lb/>
              as if to extinguish the flame which he felt within. Chloe, <lb/>
              when she had milked the goats and the sheep, had great <lb/>
              difficulty in setting her cream, for the flies were very <lb/>
              troublesome, and if driven away, they would bite her; <lb/>
              after her work was done, she washed her face, crowned <lb/>
              herself with a garland of pine-leaves, put on her girdle of <lb/>
              fawn-skin, and filled a pail with wine and milk as a beverage <lb/>
              for herself and Daphnis. As mid-day heat came on, the <lb/>
              eyes of both were fascinated; she, beholding the naked <lb/>
              and faultless figure of Daphnis, was ready to melt with <lb/>
              love; Daphnis, on the other hand, beholding Chloe in her <lb/>
              fawn-skin girdle and with the garland of pine-leaves on <lb/>
              her head, holding out the milk-pail to him, fancied he beheld <lb/>
              one of the Nymphs of the Grot, and taking the garland <lb/>
              from her head, he placed it on his own, first covering it <lb/>
              with kisses; while she, after often kissing it, put Oil his <lb/>
              dress, which he had stripped off in order to bathe. Some­ <lb/>
              times they began in sport to pelt* each other with apples, <lb/>
              and amused themselves with adorning each other's hair, <lb/>
              carefully dividing it. She compared the black hair of <lb/>
              Daphnis to myrtle-berries; while he likened her cheeks to <lb/>
              apples,! because the white was suffused with red. He then <lb/>
              taught her to play on the pipe;—when she began to breathe <lb/>
              into it, he snatched it from her, ran over the reeds with his <lb/>

            and their flocks around them were reposing in the shade, <lb/>
            Chloe imperceptibly fell asleep. Daphnis laid down his <lb/>
            pipe, and while gazing upon her whole person with insa­ <lb/>
            liable eyes, there being no one to inspire him with shame; <lb/>
            he thus murmured, directing his words to her:—“ What <lb/>
            eyes are those, which are now closed in sleep! what a <lb/>
            mouth is that, which breathes so sweetly! no apples, no <lb/>

            to take its prey, but hovered over Chloe's cheek and touched <lb/>

            seeing the swallow still fluttering near her, and Daphnis <lb/>
            laughing at her alarm, her fear vanished, and she rubbed <lb/>
            her eyes, which were still disposed to sleep. The grass­ <lb/>
            hopper chirped from her bosom, as if in gratitude for his <lb/>
            deliverance. At the sound Chloe screamed again; at which <lb/>
            Daphnis laughed, and availing himself of the opportunity, <lb/>
            put his hand into her bosom and drew the happy chirper <lb/>
            from its place, which did not cease its note even when in his <lb/>
            hand; Chloe was pleased at seeing the innocent cause of <lb/>
            her alarm, kissed it, and replaced it, still singing, in her <lb/>
            bosom.</p>
          <p>At this moment they were delighted with listening to a <lb/>
            ring-dove in the neighbouring wood, and upon Chloe's <lb/>
            inquiring what the bird meant by its note, Daphnis told her <lb/>
            the legend, which was commonly current:—“ There was a <lb/>
            maiden, my love, who, like yourself, was beautiful; like <lb/>
            yourself, she tended largo herds of cattle; and, like yourself, <lb/>
            She was in the flower of youth. She sang sweetly;—so <note type="footnote"> * Xenophon (Anab. Iv. 8,20), given an account of the Crocks In their <lb/>

             <pb n="281"/>
            sweetly, that the herds were delighted with her song, and <lb/>
            needed neither the crook nor the goad to manage them ; <lb/>
            they obeyed her voice; and remaining near listened to the <lb/>
            maid, as she sat under the shade of the pine crowned with <lb/>
            a garland of its leaves, and singing the praises of Pan,* <lb/>
            and the nymph Pitys. A youth, who pastured his herds at <lb/>
            a little distance, and who was handsome, and fond as herself <lb/>
            of melody, vied with her in singing; as he was a man, his <lb/>
            tones were deeper, but as he was young, they were very <lb/>
            sweet. He sang, and charmed away eight of her best cows <lb/>
            to his own pastures. The maiden was mortified at the loss <lb/>
            of her cattle, and at being so much surpassed in song; and, <lb/>
            in her despair, prayed the gods to convert her into a bird <lb/>
            before she reached her home. The gods assented to her <lb/>
            prayer, and metamorphosed her into a bird; under which <lb/>
            form, as of old, she frequents the mountains, and delights in <lb/>
            warbling. Her note bespeaks her misfortune, for she is <lb/>
            calling her wandering cows. it</p>
          <p>Such were the delights of summer.-Autumn was now <lb/>
            advanced, and the black grapes were ripening; when some <lb/>
            pirates of Tyre, in a light Carian bark,t that they might <lb/>
            not appear to be foreigners, touched at that coast and came <lb/>
            on shore, armed with coats of mail and swords, and plun­ <lb/>
            dered everything which fell in their way. They carried off <lb/>
            fragrant vine,‡ corn in great plenty, honey in the comb. <lb/>
            They also drove off some of Dorco's oxen, and seized <lb/>
            Daphnis, who was musing in a melancholy mood, and ram­ <lb/>
            bling alone by the sea-shore. For Cbloe being but young, <lb/>
            was afraid of the insults of some of the saucy shepherds, and <lb/>

            than the plunder of the fields, they took no more trouble <lb/>
            about the goats, not did they proceed farther, but carried <lb/>
            off the unlucky Daphnis to their vessel, weeping as he was <lb/>
            hurried along, at a loss what to do, and calling loudly upon <lb/>
            Chloe. When they bad put him on board, they slipped <lb/>
            their cable, and rowed from the shore. Chloe, in the mean <lb/>
            time, who was still driving her flock, and carrying in her <lb/>
            hand a new pipe as a present for Daphnis, when she saw <lb/>
            the goats running about in confusion, and heard Daphnis <lb/>
            calling out to her every moment in a louder voice, quitted <lb/>
            her sheep, threw down the pipe, and ran to Dorco beseech. <lb/>
            ing him to assist her.--He had been severely wounded by <lb/>
            the pirates, and was lying upon the ground still breathing, <lb/>
            the blood flowing from him in streams. At the sight of <lb/>
            Chloe, reviving a little owing to the force of his former love, <lb/>
            he exclaimed, I shall shortly be no more, dear Chloe; I <lb/>
            fought in defence of my oxen, and some of the rascally <lb/>
            pirates have beaten me as they would have done an ox. <lb/>
            Save your beloved Daphnis, revenge me, and destroy them. <lb/>
            I have taught my cows to follow the sound of this pipe, and <lb/>
            to obey its melody, even if they be feeding at the greatest <lb/>
            distance. Take this pipe; breathe in it those notes, in <lb/>
            which I once instructed Daphnis, and in which Daphnis <lb/>
            instructed you. Do this, and leave the issue to the pipe and <lb/>
            the cows. Moreover I make you a present of the pipe; <lb/>
            with it I have obtained the prize from many a shepherd and <lb/>
            many a herdsman. In return give me but one kiss, while I <lb/>
            yet live; and when I am dead, shed a tear over me: and <lb/>
            when you see another tending my flocks, remember Dorco.</p>
          <p>Here he ceased, gave her a last kiss, and with the kiss <lb/>
            resigned his breath. Chloe put the pipe to her lips, and <lb/>
            blew with all her might. The cows began to low at hearing <lb/>
            the well-known note, and leaped all at once into the sea. <lb/>
            As they all plunged from the same side, and caused <lb/>
            a mighty chasm in the waters the vessel lurched, the <lb/>
            waves closed over it, and it sank. The crew and Daphnis <lb/>
            fell into the sea, but they had not equal chances for preser­ <lb/>
            vation. The pirates were encumbered with their swords, <lb/>
            scaled breast-plates, and greaves reaching to mid-leg: <lb/>
            whereas Daphnis, who had been feeding his flocks in the <lb/>
            plains, had not even his sandals on; and the weather being <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            still very warm, he was half-naked. AL swam for a little <lb/>
            time, but their armour soon sunk the foreigners to the <lb/>
            bottom. Daphnis easily threw off the garments which <lb/>
            remained to encumber him, but, accustomed to swim only <lb/>
            in rivers, buoyed himself up with great difficulty: at length, <lb/>
            taught by necessity, he struck forward between two of the <lb/>
            cows, grasped a horn of each of them, and was carried along <lb/>
            as securely and as easily, as if he had been riding in his <lb/>
            own wain. Oxen, be it observed, are better swimmers than <lb/>
            men, or indeed than any animals, except aquatic birds and <lb/>
            fish, nor are they in any danger of drowning unless their <lb/>
            hoofs become softened by the water. The fact of many <lb/>
            places being still called Ox-fords,* will bear out the truth <lb/>
            of my assertion.</p>
          <p>Thus was Dapbnis delivered from two perils-from the <lb/>
            pirates and from shipwreck, and in a manner beyond all <lb/>
            expectation. When he reached the shore, he found Chloe <lb/>
            smiling through her tears: he fell on her bosom, and in­ <lb/>
            quired, what had led her to play that particular tune.—She <lb/>
            related everything which had occurred-her running to <lb/>
            Dorco—the habit of his cows—HIS ordering her to pipe that <lb/>
            tune, and finally his death, but through a feeling of shame <lb/>
            she said nothing of the kiss.</p>
          <p>They now determined to pay the last honours to their <lb/>
            benefactor; accordingly they came with the neighbours and <lb/>
            relatives of the deceased, and buried him. They then threw <lb/>
            up over his grave a large pile of earth, and planted about it <lb/>
            various trees, and suspended over it† the emblems of their <lb/>
            calling; in addition to which they poured libations of milk <lb/>
            and of juice expressed from the grapes, and broke many <lb/>
            pastoral pipes. Mournful lowings of the cattle were heard, <lb/>
            accompanied with unwonted and disorderly movements, <lb/>
            which the shepherds believed to be lamentations and <note type="footnote"> * In the P. V. of Æschylus, L 732, Prometheus tells Io; </note> <figure type="illustration">

              tokens of sorrow on the part of the herd for their departed <lb/>
              herdsman.*</p>
          <p>After the funeral of Dorco, Chloe led Daphnis to the <lb/>
            grotto of the Nymphs, where she washed him; and then, for <lb/>
            the first time in his presence, bathed her own person, fair <lb/>
            and radiant with beauty, and needing no bath to set off its <lb/>
            comeliness. Then, after gathering the flowers which the <lb/>
            season afforded, they crowned the statues with garlands, <lb/>
            and suspended Dorco's pipe as a votive offering to the <lb/>
            Nymphs. Having done this they returned to look for their <lb/>
            flocks, which they found lying on the ground neither feeding <lb/>
            nor bleating, but looking about, as if waiting in suspense <lb/>
            for their re-appearance. When they came in view of them, <lb/>
            and called to them in their usual manner, and sounded their <lb/>
            pipes, the sheep got up, and began to feed, while the goats <lb/>
            skipped about, and bleated as if exulting at the safety of <lb/>
            their herdsman.* But Daphnis could not attune his soul <lb/>
            to joy; after seeing Chloe naked, and her formerly con­ <lb/>
            cealed beauties unveiled, he felt an inward pain as though <lb/>
            preyed upon by poison. His breath went and came as <lb/>
            though he were flying from some pursuer; and then it failed, <lb/>
            as though he were exhausted with running. Chloe had come <lb/>
            from the bath with redoubled charms, and the bath was <lb/>
            thus more fatal to Daphnis than the ocean. As for him­ <lb/>
            self, he attributed his feelings to being, in fancy, still <lb/>
            among the thieves,†—rustic as he was, and as yet ignorant of <lb/>
            the thievish tricks of love. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>IT was now the middle of autumn :-the vintage* was <lb/>
            at hand, and every one was busy in the fields. One† pre­ <lb/>
            pared the wine-presses, another cleansed the casks, and <lb/>
            another twisted the osiers into baskets. Each had a sepa­ <lb/>
            rate employ-in providing short pruning hooks, to cut the <lb/>
            grapes; or a heavy stone, to pound them; or dry vine <lb/>
            branches, previously well bruised, to serve as torches, so <lb/>
            that the must might be carried away at night.</p>
          <p>Daphnis and Chloe neglected for a time their flocks and <lb/>
            mutually assisted one another. He carried the clusters in <lb/>
            baskets, threw them into the wine-presses, trod them, and <lb/>
            drew off the wine into casks ; she prepared their meals for <lb/>
            the grape-gatherers, brought old wine for their drink, and <lb/>
            plucked off the lowest bunches. Indeed, all the vines in <lb/>
            Lesbos were of lowly growth, and instead of shooting up­ <lb/>
            wards, or twining around trees, they spread their branches <note type="footnote"> * “ Hie innocentis pocula Lesbii <lb/>

            flavour; for it is said to have deserved the name of Ambrosia rather <lb/>
            than of wine, and to have been like nectar when old. In Athenæus <lb/>
            this wine is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">οίνάριον</foreign> vinulum, " the little wine," to which <lb/>
            Bacchus gave <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτέλειαν</foreign>, an innocence and immunity from drunkenness. <lb/>
            Horace terms the Lesbian an innocent or unintoxicating wine; but it <lb/>
            was the prevailing opinion among the ancients, that all sweet wines <lb/>
            were less injurious to the head, and less apt to cause intoxication, than <lb/>
            ptrong dry wines. By Pliny, however, the growths of Chios and <lb/>

            rest carried from the vineyard in deep baskets (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀῤῤίχοι</foreign>) to be poured <lb/>
            into a vat (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ληνός</foreign>) in which they were trodden by men, who had the <lb/>

            juice yet remaining in them. Vino branches were very frequently <lb/>

            downwards, which trailed along, like ivy, so close to the <lb/>
            ground, that even an infant might reach the fruit.</p>
          <p>The women, who, according to the custom at this festival <lb/>
            of Bacchus, and birth of the vine, were called from the <lb/>
            neighbouring villages to lend their assistance, all cast their <lb/>
            eyes upon Daphnis, and exclaimed that he was equal in <lb/>
            beauty to Bacchus himself. One of the most forward of <lb/>
            these wenches gave him a kiss, which inflamed Daphnis, but <lb/>
            sadly grieved poor Chloe.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the men who-were treading the wine- <lb/>
            press indulged in all manner of jests about Chloe, they <lb/>
            danced round her as furiously as so many Bacchanals round <lb/>
            a Bacchante, and exclaimed that they would gladly become <lb/>
            sheep to be fed by her hand. These compliments delighted <lb/>
            Chloe, but tormented poor Daphnis.</p>
          <p>Each of them wished the vintage over, that they might <lb/>
            return to their usual haunts, and instead of this discordant <lb/>
            din might hear the sound of their pipe, and the bleating of <lb/>
            their sheep. In a few days the vines were stript,—the <lb/>
            casks were filled,—there was no longer any need of more <lb/>
            hands, they therefore drove their flocks to the plain. In <lb/>
            the first place, with sincere delight they went to pay their <lb/>
            adoration to the Nymphs, and carried vine-branchés with <lb/>
            clusters of grapes on them, as first-fruit offerings from the <lb/>
            vintage. Indeed, they never had hitherto passed by the <lb/>
            Grotto without some token of respect, but always saluted <lb/>
            them as they passed by with their flocks to their morning <lb/>
            pasture, and when they returned in the evening, they paid <lb/>
            their adoration, and presented, as an offering, either a <lb/>
            flower, or some fruit, or a green leaf, or a libation of milk. <lb/>
            This piety, as we shall see, had in the end its due reward. <lb/>
            At the time we speak of, like young hounds just let loose, <lb/>
            they leaped about, they piped, they sang, and wrestled and <lb/>
            played with their goats and sheep.</p>
          <p>While thus sporting and enjoying themselves, an old man, <lb/>
            clothed in a coarse coat of skin, with shoes of undressed <lb/>
            leather on his feet, and with a wallet (which, by the by, was <lb/>
            a very old one) at his back, came up, seated himself near <lb/>
            them, and addressed them as follows :— <lb/>
            "I who now address you, my children, am PHILETAS. <lb/>
            I have often sung the praises of the Nymphs of yonder <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            Grotto—I have often piped in honour of Pan, and have <lb/>
            guided my numerous herd by the music of my voice. I <lb/>
            come to acquaint you with what I have seen and heard. <lb/>
            I have a garden* which I cultivate with my own hands, <lb/>
            and in which I have always worked, since I became too <lb/>
            old to tend my herds. In it is every production of the <lb/>
            different seasons; in spring it abounds with roses, lilies, <lb/>
            hyacinths, and either kind of violets; in summer with <lb/>
            poppies, pears, and apples of every sort; and now in autumn, <lb/>
            with grapes, figs, pomegranates, and green myrtles. A. <lb/>
            variety of birds fly into it every morning, some in search <lb/>
            of food, and some to warble in the shade; for the over­ <lb/>
            arching boughs afford thick shade, and three fountains <lb/>
            water the cool retreat. Were it not inclosed with a wall, <lb/>
            it might be taken for a natural wood. As I entered it to- <lb/>
            day, about noon, I espied a little boy under my pomegra­ <lb/>
            nates and myrtles, some of which he had gathered ; and was <lb/>
            holding them in his hands. His complexion was white as <lb/>
            milk, his hair a bright yellow, and he shone as if he had just <lb/>
            been bathing. He was naked and alone, and amused him­ <lb/>
            self with plucking the fruit with as much freedom as if it <lb/>
            had been his own garden. Apprehensive that in his <lb/>
            wantonness he would commit more mischief and break my <lb/>
            plants, I sprang forward to seize him, but the urchin lightly <lb/>
            and easily escaped from me, sometimes running under rose. <lb/>
            trees, and sometimes hiding himself like a young partridge <lb/>
            under the poppies.</p>
          <p>" I have frequently been fatigued with catching my suck. <lb/>
            ing kids, or my new-dropt calves; but as to this mischievous <lb/>
            creature, in perpetual motion, it was utterly impossible to <lb/>
            lay hold of him. Old as I am I was soon weary with the <lb/>
            pursuit; so, leaning on my staff for support, and keeping <lb/>
            my eyes on him lest he should escape, I asked him to <lb/>
            what neighbour he belonged, and what he meant by gather­ <lb/>
            ing what grew in another person's garden.</p>
          <p>“ He made no reply, but approaching very near me, smiled <lb/>
            sweetly in my face, and pelted me with myrtle-berries, <lb/>
            and (I know not how) so won upon me, that my anger was <note type="footnote"> * Compare the description of the garden in Achilles Tatius, L 15, <lb/>

            appeased. I intreated him to come close to me, and <lb/>
            assured him that he need not be afraid, swearing by the <lb/>
            myrtles, by the apples, and by the pomegranates of my <lb/>
            garden, that I wished only to give him one kiss,. for which <lb/>
            he should ever afterwards have liberty to gather as much <lb/>
            fruit, and to pluck as many flowers as he pleased.</p>
          <p>“ Upon hearing me thus address him, he burst into a <lb/>
            merry laugh, and with a voice sweeter than that of the <lb/>
            swallow or the nightingale, or of the swan when grown <lb/>
            aged like myself, he replied: 'I grudge you not a kiss, <lb/>
            Philetas, for I have more pleasure in being kissed, than <lb/>
            you would have in growing young again; but consider <lb/>
            whether the gift would suit your time of life; for, old as you <lb/>
            are, one kiss would not satisfy you, nor prevent you from <lb/>
            running after me, while if even a hawk, an eagle, or any <lb/>
            other swifter bird, were to pursue me it would pursue in <lb/>
            vain. I am not the child which I appear to be ; but I am <lb/>
            older than SATURN, ay, older than TIME himself. I knew <lb/>
            you well, Philetas, when you were in the flower of your <lb/>
            youth, and when you tended your widely-scattered flock in <lb/>
            yonder marsh. I was near you, when you sat beneath those <lb/>
            beech-trees, and were wooing your Amaryllis : I was close <lb/>
            to the maiden, but you could not discern mo. I gave her <lb/>
            to you, and some fine boys, who are now excellent husband­ <lb/>
            men and herdsmen, are the pledges of your love. At this <lb/>
            present time I am tending Daphnis and Chloe like a shep­ <lb/>
            herd; and when I have brought them together in the <lb/>
            morning, I retire to your garden: here I disport myself <lb/>
            among your flowers and plants, and here I bathe in your <lb/>
            fountain. Through mo it is that your flowers and shrubs <lb/>
            are so beauteous, for the waters, which have bathed me, <lb/>
            refresh them. Look now, if any of your plants be broken <lb/>
            down!—see, if any of your fruit be plucked !-examine <lb/>
            whether the stalk of any flower be crushed -or the clearness <lb/>
            of any one of your fountains be disturbed ! and rejoice <lb/>
            that you alone, in your old age, have bad the privilege of <lb/>
            beholding the boy who is now before you.' With these <lb/>
            words he sprang like the youngling of a nightingale among <lb/>
            the myrtles, and climbing from bough to bough ascended <lb/>
            through the foliage to the summit of the tree. I observed <lb/>
            wings upon his shoulders, and between them a tiny bow,. <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            and arrows; but in a moment I could neither see him nor <lb/>
            them. Unless I have grown grey in vain, unless I have <lb/>
            got into my dotage in growing old, you may rely on me, <lb/>
            when I assure you, that you are consecrate to LOVE, and . <lb/>
            that you are under his peculiar care."</p>
          <p>Daphnis and Choe were delighted, but they regarded what <lb/>
            they had heard as an amusing story rather than a sober <lb/>
            fact; and inquired ot Philetas who and what this LOVE could <lb/>
            be ? whether he were a boy or a bird ? and of what powers <lb/>
            he was possessed ? “ My young friends," said Philetas, <lb/>
            “ he is a god, young, beautiful, and ever on the wing. He <lb/>
            rejoices, therefore, in the company of youth, ho is ever in <lb/>
            search of beauty, and adds wings to the souls of those he <lb/>
            favours.* He has power far beyond that of Jove himself. <lb/>
            He commands the elements, he rules the stars, and even <lb/>
            the gods themselves, who are otherwise his equals; t your <lb/>
            power over your flocks is nothing compared to his. All <lb/>
            these flowers are the works of love: these plants arc effects <lb/>
            produced by him. Through him these rivers flow, and these <lb/>
            zephyrs breathe. I have seen a bull smitten by his power, <lb/>
            who bellowed as though breeze-stung. ‡ I have seen the goat <lb/>
            enamoured of the female, and following her everywhere. <lb/>
            I myself was once young, I felt his influence, I loved Ama­ <lb/>
            rillis. I thought not of my food, I cared not for my drink; <lb/>
            I could take no rest, for sleep was banished from my eye­ <lb/>
            lids. My soul was sad—my heart beat quick—my limbs <lb/>
            felt a deadly chill. Now I cried aloud, as if I had been <lb/>
            beaten; now I was as silent as if I were dead; and now <note type="footnote"> * ......Love's heralds should be thoughts, <lb/>

              I plunged into the rivers, as if to extinguish the flame <lb/>
              which consumed me. I invoked Pan to assist me, inasmuch <lb/>
              as he had known what it was to love his Pitys. I poured <lb/>
              forth praises to the Nymph Echo for repeating the name <lb/>
              of my Amaryllis: in anger I broke my pipe because it could <lb/>
              soothe my herds, but could not prevail over Amaryllis; for <lb/>
              there is no mighty magic against love; no medicine, whether <lb/>
              in food or drink: nothing, in short, save kisses - and em­ <lb/>
              braces, and the closest union of the naked body."</p>
          <p>Philetas, having given them this information, bade them <lb/>
            farewell; but before permitting him to depart, they presented <lb/>
            him with a cheese, and a kid with newly budding horns.</p>
          <p>Daphnis and Chloe, left to themselves, mused in silence <lb/>
            upon the name of Love, which they had now beard for <lb/>
            the first time. Sorrow seemed to have stupified them, till <lb/>
            at night, as they returned home, they began to compare <lb/>
            their own sensations with what they had heard from <lb/>
            Philetas.</p>
          <p>‘ According to Philetas, lovers are sad—so are we; they <lb/>
            neglect their calling-so do we; they cannot sleep-no <lb/>
            more can we. A fire appears to burn within them­ <lb/>
            we feel this fire; they long for the sight of one another <lb/>
            —we, too, are always wishing for the day to dawn. Our <lb/>
            disorder must be love, and we have loved each other with­ <lb/>
            out being aware of it. If this be not love, and if wo <lb/>
            be not mutually lovers, why are we thus sad? why do we <lb/>
            so eagerly seek each other P All that Philetas has told us <lb/>
            is true. The boy, whom he saw in the garden, is the same <lb/>
            who appeared to our parents in the dream, and commanded <lb/>
            that we should follow the pastoral life. How is it possible <lb/>
            to catch the urchin ? He is little and will escape from us. <lb/>
            At the same time, who can escape from him He has <lb/>
            wings, and will pursue us. We must away to the Nymphs <lb/>
            and implore their assistance. And yet Pan could not assist <lb/>
            Pbiletas when in love with Amaryllis. We must seek the <lb/>
            remedies which the old man suggested-kisses and em­ <lb/>
            braces, and lying naked upon the grass; we shall feel it <lb/>
            very cold, but we will bear what Philetas has borne before <lb/>
            us. Thus were their thoughts employed during the night. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig61.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="291"/>
              The next morning, after driving their flocks to pasture, <lb/>
              they for the first time kissed each other upon meeting, and <lb/>
              afterwards mutually embraced.</p>
          <p>The third remedy they were afraid of; the lying naked <lb/>
            upon the grass appeared too bold a step for a maiden, Day, <lb/>
            even for a youthful goatherd. Again, therefore, they passed <lb/>
            a sleepless night, calling to mind what they had done, <lb/>
            regretting what they had omitted. " .We kissed," said <lb/>
            they, "and are none the better; we embraced, and have <lb/>
            found no relief. This lying side by side must needs be the <lb/>
            sole remedy for love; assuredly it will prove more effica­ <lb/>
            cious than the kiss and the embrace." As might have been <lb/>
            expected, their dreams were akin to their daily thoughts. <lb/>
            In sleep they kissed and they embraced; in sleep they did <lb/>
            that which they had omitted to do during the day. Next <lb/>
            morning they arose more than ever inflamed with passion, <lb/>
            and hissed* along their flocks, all the while in anticipation of <lb/>
            the kiss. They came in sight of one another, their faces <lb/>
            mutually beaming with delight. Again there was repeated <lb/>
            the kiss and the embrace; the remaining remedy was still <lb/>
            untried, Daphnis being unwilling to propose it, and Chloe <lb/>
            feeling the like hesitation. Chance came to their aid. They <lb/>
            were sitting beside each other upon the trunk of a tree: <lb/>
            having once tasted the luxury of a kiss, they were insatiable <lb/>
            of its delight; they entwined one another in their arms, <lb/>
            and so drew their bodies into closer contact. Daphnis, in <lb/>
            the course of this embrace, straining Chloo more tightly <lb/>
            to his bosom, she falls upon her side, and be falls with <lb/>
            her, and thus acting out the image of their dreams, they <lb/>
            long lay locked in each other's arms. Their innocence <lb/>
            knew nothing beyond this; they imagined that love had <lb/>
            nothing farther to bestow; so after fruitlessly passing the <lb/>
            greater portion of the day in this manner, they separated, <lb/>
            and drove home their flocks, loathing the approach of night. <lb/>
            They might, perhaps, on a future occasion have become <lb/>
            greater adepts in the mysteries of love, had not the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing circumstance spread tumult and confusion through­ <lb/>
            out their neighbourhood. <figure type="illustration">

              </p>
          <p>Some rich young men of Methymnn, who had formed <lb/>
            a pleasure party for passing the vintage-season out of town, <lb/>
            launched a small vessel, employing their servants as rowers, <lb/>
            and shaped their course towards the fields of Mitylene, <lb/>
            which lie near the sea-coast. They knew that there was <lb/>
            an excellent harbour for them, with every thing adapted <lb/>
            for their accommodation, as the shore was adorned with <lb/>
            handsome houses, with baths, with gardens, and with <lb/>
            groves, some of which were the productions of nature, and <lb/>
            some of art.</p>
          <p>Here the party arrived, and drew their boat into a safe <lb/>
            place, after which they committed no acts of mischief, but <lb/>
            amused themselves in various ways, with rod and line <lb/>
            angling for rock-fish, which were found under the different <lb/>
            promontories, or hunting the hares, which, terrified by the <lb/>
            noise of the grape gatherers, had fled towards the shore, <lb/>
            and capturing them by means of dogs and nets. Part of <lb/>
            their amusement also was to set snares for birds: many <lb/>
            wild ducks, wild geese and bustards were caught, so that <lb/>
            their sport supplied their table in a great measure; and <lb/>
            whatever addition they wanted was easily procured from <lb/>
            the labourers in the fields, who were paid more than its <lb/>
            worth for everything which they supplied. Their chief <lb/>
            inconvenience was want of bread and wine, and a good <lb/>
            lodging at night; for as it was late in the autumn, they did <lb/>
            not think it safe to sleep on board their boat, but in appre­ <lb/>
            hension of storms, usual at this season, were ,,'ont to <lb/>
            draw it up on shore.</p>
          <p>It so happened that a countryman had broken the old <lb/>
            rope to which the stone was suspended for crushing his <lb/>
            grapes after they had been trodden in the wine-press, and <lb/>
            being in want of another to supply its place, had come <lb/>
            clandestinely down to the sea-shore, and taking the cable <lb/>
            from the boat, which was left without any one to watch it, <lb/>
            had quietly conveyed it home to supply his need. The young <lb/>
            Methymnæans, in the morning, made inquiries after their <lb/>
            rope; but as no one confessed the theft, after venting their <lb/>
            reproaches on this breach of hospitality, they launched <lb/>
            their boat, and left that part of the coast. After sailing <lb/>
            rather more than a league, they landed on the estate where <lb/>
            Daphnis and Chloe dwelt. It appeared to them to be a <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            good country for hare-hunting. Having no rope to serve <lb/>
            as a cable, they twisted some vine-branches as a substi. <lb/>
            tute, and tied the head of their boat to the shore: then <lb/>
            let loose the dogs to scent about in the places most <lb/>
            likely for game, and fixed their nets. The cry of the <lb/>
            hounds, running hither and thither, frightened the goats, <lb/>
            which fled from the mountains down to the sea-shore, where <lb/>
            some of the boldest of the flock, finding no food upon the <lb/>
            coast, approached the boat and gnawed the branches which <lb/>
            were fastened as a cable.</p>
          <p>At the same moment a swell set in, owing to the breezes <lb/>
            blowing from the mountains. The motion of the waves <lb/>
            began to carry off the boat, and, at length, bore it out to sea. <lb/>
            The l\lethymnæans saw the accident : some of them ran <lb/>
            in great haste down to the shore: others hastened to call the <lb/>
            dogs together: and all of them cried out for assistance, in <lb/>
            hopes of assembling the labourers from the neighbouring <lb/>
            fields. It was all of no avail, for the wind increased, and <lb/>
            the boat was driven down the current. When the Methym­ <lb/>
            næans found themselves thus deprived of it, and of the con­ <lb/>
            siderable property which it contained, they inquired for the <lb/>
            goat-herd, and finding him to be Daphnis, they beat him <lb/>
            severely and stripped him. One of them took a dog-leash, <lb/>
            and bending Daphnis’ arms behind his back, was preparing <lb/>
            to bind him. Poor Daphnis, smarting with his beating, roared <lb/>
            out for assistance : he called upon all his neighbours, but upon <lb/>
            Lamon and Dryas in particular. The old men took his part <lb/>
            stoutly: the toils of husbandry had made them hard handed; <lb/>
            they demanded that an inquiry should be made agreeably to <lb/>
            the rules of justice. The neighbours, who had now reached <lb/>
            the spot, backed them in their demand, and appointed Phile­ <lb/>
            tas umpire in the business. He was the oldest man present, <lb/>
            and was celebrated among the villagers for the equity of <lb/>
            his decisions. The charge of the Methymnæans was made <lb/>
            plainly and with conciseness suitable to the rustic judge <lb/>
            before whom they pleaded. “ We came here," said they, <lb/>
            “ to hunt, and fastened our boat to the shore with some <lb/>
            vine-branches, while we roamed about with our dogs in <lb/>
            search of game. In the meantime, this young man’s goats <lb/>
            came down to the coast and ate the fastening of our <lb/>
            boat, which has proved the loss of it. You yourself, <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            saw it driven out to sea, and what valuables think you <lb/>
            it had on board ? Why, store of clothes and of dog-gear, <lb/>
            and of money—money enough to have purchased all these <lb/>
            fields around us. In return for what we have lost, we have <lb/>
            surely a right to carry off this heedless goatherd, who, <lb/>
            sailor-fashion, chooses to pasture his goats on the sea- <lb/>
            coast."</p>
          <p>This was what the Methymnæans alleged. Daphnis was <lb/>
            in sore plight from the blows which he had received ; but <lb/>
            seeing Chloe among the crowd, he rose superior to his pain, <lb/>
            and spoke as follows</p>
          <p>“I am, and always have been very careful of my herds. <lb/>
            What neighbour can say that a goat of mine ever browsed <lb/>
            upon his garden, or devoured any of his sprouting vines ? <lb/>
            It is these sportsmen who are themselves to blame, for hav­ <lb/>
            ing dogs so badly broken as to run wildly about making <lb/>
            such a barking, and like so many wolves driving my sheep <lb/>
            from hill and dale down to the sea. The poor brutes eat the <lb/>
            vine branches; no wonder, for they could find no grass, nor <lb/>
            shrubs, nor thyme upon the sands. The sea and the winds <lb/>
            destroyed the boat; let the storm bear the blame and not <lb/>
            my goats. They say, that they had left their clothes and <lb/>
            money on board:—who, in his senses, can believe that a <lb/>
            boat freighted with so much wealth, was intrusted to a vine <lb/>
            branch for its cable ?”</p>
          <p>Daphnis said no more, but burst into tears, which moved <lb/>
            all his countrymen with compassion. Philetas, the judge, <lb/>
            swore by Pan and the Nymphs, that neither Daphnis nor <lb/>
            his goats were in fault; that only the sea and the winds <lb/>
            could be accused, and that they were not under his jurisdic­ <lb/>
            tion. This decision had no effect on the Methymnæans, <lb/>
            who flew into a rage, and seizing Daphnis, were preparing <lb/>
            to bind him. The villagers irritated at such behaviour, full <lb/>
            upon them as thick as starlings or rooks, and rescued Daph­ <lb/>
            nis, who now began to fight in his own defence. In a very <lb/>
            short time the Mitylenæans, by dint of their clubs, put the <lb/>
            strangers to flight, and did not desist from the pursuit, till <lb/>
            they had driven them into a different quarter of the island.</p>
          <p>While they were engaged in the pursuit, Chloe led Dapin­ <lb/>
            nis gently by the hand to the grotto of the Nymphs ; their <lb/>
            she washed the blood from his face and nostrils, and taking <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            a slice of bread and cheese from her scrip, gave it him to eat. <lb/>
            After she had thus refreshed him, she impressed a honeyed <lb/>
            kiss with her tender lips.</p>
          <p>So near was Daphnis getting into serious trouble; but the <lb/>
            affair did not end here. The Methymnæans reached their <lb/>
            own city with much pain and difficulty; for instead of sail­ <lb/>
            ing they bad to travel on foot, and instead of every luxury, <lb/>
            and convenience, they had nothing but bruises and wounds <lb/>
            for their comfort. Immediately upon their arrival at home, <lb/>
            they called an assembly of their fellow townsmen, and in­ <lb/>
            treated them to take up arms to avenge their cause, which <lb/>
            they represented in their own way, altogether concealing <lb/>
            the real truth of the matter, for fear of being laughed at for <lb/>
            having been so soundly beaten by a few shepherds. They <lb/>
            accused the people of Mitylene of having seized their boat, <lb/>
            as if it belonged to an enemy, and of plundering it of all its <lb/>
            contents. Their wounds, which they exhibited, gained <lb/>
            them belief among their countrymen, who resolved to avenge <lb/>
            the cause of the young men, and more particularly as <lb/>
            they belonged to the first families in the place. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly they resolved to begin the war without the usual forms <lb/>
            of proclamation, and ordered their naval commander to <lb/>
            launch ten vessels immediately, and ravage the coasts of the <lb/>
            enemy. As the winter was coming on they did not think it <lb/>
            safe to hazard a larger fleet.</p>
          <p>Early the very next day he put to sea; and employing his <lb/>
            soldiers as rowers, steered his course to the shores of Mity­ <lb/>
            lene. Here he seized numbers of cattle, a great quantity of <lb/>
            corn and wine, (the vintage being lately ended,) together <lb/>
            with the labourers who were still at work there. Thus <lb/>
            plundering as they went, they landed at last on the estate <lb/>
            where Daphnis and Chloe resided, and carried off whatever <lb/>
            came to hand. Daphnis was not then tending his goats, <lb/>
            but had gone to the wood, to cut green branches for the <lb/>
            winter fodder of his kids. Looking down from the woods, <lb/>
            he saw these ravages; and immediately hid himself in the <lb/>
            hollow of a decayed beech tree. Chloe happened to be with <lb/>
            the flocks; she fled in affright to the grotto of the Nymphs: <lb/>
            and the invaders pursued her. Here she intreated them, if <lb/>
            they had any respect to the deities of the place, to spare her <lb/>
            and her flocks; but her prayers were of no avail: for the <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            ravagers, after offering many insults to the statues of the <lb/>
            goddesses, drove off the flocks, and hurried Chloe along with <lb/>
            them, as if she had been one of her own goats or sheep, <lb/>
            striking her ever and anon with vine twigs.</p>
          <p>Their vessels being now filled with plunder of all kinds, <lb/>
            the Methymnæans thought it advisable not to prosecute <lb/>
            their voyage farther, but to return home, more especially as <lb/>
            they were apprehensive of the winter storms, and of an <lb/>
            attack from the inhabitants. Accordingly they put about; <lb/>
            but, as there was no wind, they had to labour at their oars.</p>
          <p>Daphnis, (when all was quiet) came down to the plain, <lb/>
            the usual place for pasturing their flocks, but not a goat, nor <lb/>
            a sheep was to be seen, nor was Chloe herself there: when <lb/>
            he saw the whole place deserted, and found Chloe's pipe <lb/>
            thrown upon the ground, he burst into loud and bitter <lb/>
            lamentations :-he ran to the beech tree, which bad been <lb/>
            their usual seat, and then to the ocean, to try if he could <lb/>
            descry her, he searched for her in the grotto, whither <lb/>
            she had fled, and whence she had been dragged away. Here, <lb/>
            at last, he threw himself on the ground in despair, and ex­ <lb/>
            claimed against the Nymphs, as the deserters of his Chloe.</p>
          <p>" Chloe has been torn away from you, yo Nymphs, and <lb/>
            yet ye could endure to see it! she who has woven so many <lb/>
            garlands for you, who has poured so many libations of new <lb/>
            milk to you, and whose pipe is here suspended as an offering <lb/>
            to you ! Never did a wolf carry off a single goat of mine, <lb/>
            but marauders have now carried away all my flock, and their <lb/>
            mistress with them.—My goats will be flayed, my sheep will <lb/>
            be sacrificed, and my Chloe will henceforth be confined <lb/>
            within a city ! how shall I venture to return to my father <lb/>
            and mother without my goats, and without my Chloe ?— <lb/>
            I, who shall appear a deserter of my charge! I have no <lb/>
            more flocks to tend, so here will I lie, till death take me, <lb/>
            or the enemy again lay hold of me. Ah! my Chloe, do you <lb/>
            share in my sufferings ?-do you still remember these <lb/>
            plains, these Nymphs and me ; or are you consoled by having <lb/>
            the sheep and goats for your companions in captivity? "</p>
          <p>Thus did Daphnis vent his grief, till weary with weeping <lb/>
            and lamenting he fell into a deep sleep. While slumbering, <lb/>
            the three Nymphs appeared to stand before him; they wero <lb/>
            tall and beautiful, half-naked and without sandals; their hair <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            flowed loose over their shoulders, and indeed in every <lb/>
            respect they resembled their statues in the grotto. At first <lb/>
            they shewed signs of commiseration for Daphnis, and, <lb/>
            presently, the eldest of them addressed him in these con­ <lb/>
            solatory words:—</p>
          <p>" Do not accuse us, Daphnis; Chloe is an object of <lb/>
            deeper anxiety to us, than she is even to yourself. We had <lb/>
            compassion on her when she was an infant; when she was <lb/>
            exposed in this grot, we adopted her and bred her up. She <lb/>
            is not Lamon's daughter, nor do Lamon's fields or herds in <lb/>
            any part belong to her. We have at this time been pro­ <lb/>
            viding for her safety, so that she shall not be taken to <lb/>
            Methymne as a slave, nor be numbered among the spoils. <lb/>
            We have intreated Pan, (whose statue stands beneath <lb/>
            yonder pine, and whom you have never honoured even with <lb/>
            a bunch of flowers) to come forward as Chloe's champion, <lb/>
            for he is more used to warfare than we are, and has often <lb/>
            quitted his rural groves to join in the din of battle. He is <lb/>
            on Chloe's side, and he will be found no despicable enemy <lb/>
            by the Methymnæans. Be not uneasy then, nor perplex <lb/>
            yourself; arise, shew yourself to Lamon and Myrtale, who <lb/>
            have thrown themselves on the earth in despair, under <lb/>
            the idea that you too are carried off by the enemy. To- <lb/>
            morrow Chloe and her flocks shall return, when you shall <lb/>
            tend them together, and together shall play upon your pipe. <lb/>
            —Leave your future fates to the care of LOVE. It</p>
          <p>After these words and vision in his dream, Daphnis <lb/>
            sprang up, and, while his eyes wero filled with tears, <lb/>
            partly of grief and partly of joy, he paid his adorations to <lb/>
            the statues of the Nymphs, and vowed, that upon Chloe’s <lb/>
            safe return he would sacrifice a she-goat (the best of his <lb/>
            herd) to the protecting goddesses. Then he hastened to <lb/>
            the pine, beneath whose shade stood the statue of Pan. <lb/>
            The legs of the rural god were those of the goat, and he <lb/>
            had a homed forehead; in one hand he held a pipe, with <lb/>
            the other he grasped a goat, which was in the attitude of <lb/>
            bounding. Daphnis adored his statue likewise, prayed in <lb/>
            behalf of Chloe, and vowed to sacrifice a he-goat for her <lb/>
            safety. Scarcely could he cease from his tears and in­ <lb/>
            treaties by sun-set, when taking up the green fodder <lb/>
            which he bad beep cutting, he returned to his home, where <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            his presence dispelled Lamon’s grief and filled him with joy. <lb/>
            After taking some refreshment he retired to rest; but his <lb/>
            sleep was not even then without tears. In his slumbers he <lb/>
            poured forth prayers to the Nymphs to bless him with <lb/>
            another vision, and sighed for the return of day, when his <lb/>
            Chloe was to be restored.-Of all nights this appeared to <lb/>
            him the longest.-During its continuance the following <lb/>
            events took place</p>
          <p>When the Methymnæan commander had rowed somewhat <lb/>
            more than a mile, lie wished to afford his men some rest, <lb/>
            wearied as they were with their past exertions. At length <lb/>
            be espied a promontory, which projected into the sea in a <lb/>
            semicircular form, affording a harbour more calm and secure <lb/>
            than even a regular port. Here he anchored his fleet, keep­ <lb/>
            ing his vessels at a distance from the shore, that they might <lb/>
            not be exposed to any attack from the inhabitants, while his <lb/>
            men indulged themselves at their ease and in all security. <lb/>
            The crews having plenty of all manner of provision among <lb/>
            their plunder, eat and drank and gave themselves up to joy, <lb/>
            as if they had been celebrating a festival for victory. The <lb/>
            day was closing; and their merriment was being prolonged <lb/>
            to night, when suddenly all the earth appeared in a blaze; <lb/>
            and the dash of oars was heard, as if a mighty fleet were <lb/>
            approaching.* They called upon their commander to arm <lb/>
            himself: they shouted to each other; some fancied that they <lb/>
            were wounded; others that they saw the bodies of the slain <lb/>
            before their eyes. It appeared like a night engagement <lb/>
            against an invisible enemy.</p>
          <p>A day of greater terror succeeded to the darkness. The <lb/>
            goats belonging to Daphnis, appeared with branches full of <lb/>
            ivy berries on their horns: the rams and ewes, which bad <lb/>
            been taken with Chloe, instead of bleating, howled like <lb/>
            wolves. Their mistress was seen to have a garland of pine- <lb/>
            leaves round her head. The sea also had its marvels. The <figure type="illustration">

              anchors stuck fast in the mud, and could not be drawn up: <lb/>
              when the men dipped their oars in order to row, they were <lb/>
              shattered in pieces. The dolphins leaped from the sea, and <lb/>
              with their tails broke the planks of the vessels. From the <lb/>
              top of the rock behind the promontory the sound of a pipe <lb/>
              was heard: but it did not, like the pipe, delight the ear <lb/>
              with dulcet sounds, but terrified like the harsh blast of a <lb/>
              trumpet. The men of Methymna were confounded: they <lb/>
              seized their arms, and called out to their enemies who were <lb/>
              invisible; they prayed for tho return of night, which might <lb/>
              bring a truce to their terrors.</p>
          <p>To all those who were capable of reflection, it was evident, <lb/>
            that these phantasms and sounds proceeded from Pan, who <lb/>
            must have conceived some cause of indignation against them: <lb/>
            but what the cause could be, they were at a loss to conjec­ <lb/>
            ture, for they had not plundered any thing which was sacred <lb/>
            to the god. About the middle of the day their commander <lb/>
            (not without the intervention of the god) fell into a deep <lb/>
            sleep, when Pan appeared to him and addressed him thus:</p>
          <p>" 0 most abandoned, most impious of men, to what <lb/>
            lengths has your madness driven you! The fields, which are <lb/>
            dear to me, ye have filled with the tumults of war: the herds <lb/>
            and the flocks, which were my peculiar care, ye have taken <lb/>
            as plunder. Ye have dragged a virgin from the altar, whom <lb/>
            Cupid had reserved in order to adorn a Tale of Love. Ye <lb/>
            regarded not the Nymphs, who beheld your deeds, nor even <lb/>
            me the mighty Pau. Never shall ye reach Methymna, <lb/>
            sailing with these spoils, nor shall yourselves escape the <lb/>
            terrors of the pipe which has thus confounded you. Unless <lb/>
            ve immediately give back Chloe to the Nymphs, and restore <lb/>
            her goats and sheep, I will submerge you and ye shall <lb/>
            become food for fishes. Bestir yourselves, therefore, land <lb/>
            both her and them, I will guide your course by sea, and her's <lb/>
            by land."</p>
          <p>ryaxis (for such was the commander's name) awoke from <lb/>
            his dream, and immediately ordered the captain of every <lb/>
            vessel to search among his prisoners for Chloe. They soon <lb/>
            found her, for she was sitting still crowned with pine-leaves, <lb/>
            and brought her before him. Bryaxis regarded the orna­ <lb/>
            ment on her head as a proof and confirmation of what he <lb/>
            had seen in the vision, and without delay took her on board <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            his own vessel,. and conveyed her safe to the shore. No <lb/>
            sooner had she landed than the sound of the pipe was again <lb/>
            heard from the rock: but it was no longer dreadful like the <lb/>
            blast of the war trumpet: on the contrary it was sweet and <lb/>
            pastoral in tone, as when the shepherd is leading out his <lb/>
            flock to feed. The sheep ran down the gangway,t without <lb/>
            their horny hoofs slipping. The goats, used to steep places, <lb/>
            proceeded still more venturesomely. Upon reaching the shore <lb/>
            the flocks formed themselves in a ring around Chloe, like a <lb/>
            company of dancers, skipping and bleating and exhibiting <lb/>
            every symptom of joy; while the sheep and goats and oxen <lb/>
            belonging to the other shepherds remained quiet in the holds <lb/>
            of the vessels, as if knowing that the pipe, which sounded, <lb/>
            was not intended to summon them. While every one was <lb/>
            struck with astonishment, and celebrated the power of Pan, <lb/>
            still stranger sights appeared both by sea and land.</p>
          <p>Before the Trews had time to heave their anchors, the <lb/>
            ships of themselves began to make sail, and a dolphin, which <lb/>
            leaped and played on the waves, swam before the admiral's <lb/>
            ship as guide. On the other hand Chloe's goats and sheep <lb/>
            were led by most ravishing music of the pipe, which con­ <lb/>
            tinued its notes, though the player was invisible: sheep and <lb/>
            goats continued to graze and pace gently onward listening <lb/>
            with delight to the melody.</p>
          <p>It was the time of evening-pasture, when Daphnis from <lb/>
            the summit of a rock espied his Chloe and her flocks. 0 Pan! <lb/>
            O ye Nymphsf ! he shouted in rapture, and hurrying down <lb/>
            into the plain threw himself into Chloe's arms, fainted, and <lb/>
            fell to the ground. The kisses and soothing embraces of <lb/>
            the maiden with some difficulty restored him to his senses, <lb/>
            after which he proceeded to their favourite beech-tree, under <lb/>
            the shade of which he Fiat down, and inquired how Chloe <lb/>
            had escaped from so many enemies. Site related everything <lb/>
            which had happened-the appearance of the ivy around the <lb/>
            goats' horns-the wolfish howling of the sheep-the pine <lb/>
            garland encircling her own temples—the blaze of fire on the <lb/>
            land—the unwonted noise at sea—the two discordant notes <lb/>
            of the pipe-that of war and that of peace-the terrors of <lb/>
            the night-and lastly, how the melody guided her hither, <note type="footnote"> * ì<foreign xml:lang="grc">π αὐτὴς τη̃ς ναυρχιδος</foreign>, literally, in the admiral </note> <figure type="illustration">

              though fields and over plains to which she was a stranger. <lb/>
              Upon hearing this, Daphnis recognized the vision of the <lb/>
              Nymphs, and the influence of Pan, and in his turn, he gave <lb/>
              Chloe an account of all which he had seen and heard. He <lb/>
              informed her how when ready to destroy himself, he had <lb/>
              been preserved through the intervention of the Nymphs.</p>
          <p>He then sent Chloe to summon Dryas and Lamon with <lb/>
            their servants and to desire them to bring every requisite <lb/>
            for a sacrifice, while he in the mean time took the choicest <lb/>
            of his she-goats, crowned it with ivy (just as it had appeared <lb/>
            to the enemy on board of ship) poured milk between its <lb/>
            horns, and sacrificed it to the Nymphs. Then he hung it up <lb/>
            and flayed it, and suspended its skin as an offering to them.</p>
          <p>Chloe now arrived with Lamon and the servants. A fire <lb/>
            was immediately kindled, upon which part of the goat's flesh <lb/>
            was boiled and part of it roasted. Daphnis offered the first <lb/>
            portions to the Nymphs, and poured out to them a libation <lb/>
            of new must; he then piled some leaves into the form <lb/>
            of couches, reclined at his ease upon one of them, and gave <lb/>
            himself up to good cheer and mirth : but at the same time <lb/>
            kept a watchful eye on his sheep for fear a wolf should <lb/>
            effect what the enemy had been foiled in doing. After this <lb/>
            the party sang the praises of the Nymphs in songs, which <lb/>
            had been indited by the shepherds of by-gone days. They <lb/>
            slept in the field that night, and in the morning remembered <lb/>
            Pan. The leader of the goats was selected from the herd; <lb/>
            a chaplet of pine-leaves was bound round his horns, and he <lb/>
            was led to the statue, which stood beneath the pine; when <lb/>
            after pouring over him a libation of wine*, carefully avoid­ <lb/>
            ing all ominous expressions, the victim was slain, suspended, <lb/>
            and flayed. The flesh, part of which was roasted and part <lb/>
            boiled, was spread out upon some dry leaves in the meadow. <lb/>
            The skin with the horns was hung up on the tree hard by <lb/>
            the statue of the god—a pastoral offering to a pastoral <lb/>
            deity. A first portion also of the flesh was offered, and <note type="footnote"> # <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐφημου̃ντες</foreign>. Especial care was taken during a sacrifice, that no <lb/>
            inauspicious or frivolous words were uttered by any of the bystanders ; <lb/>

            libations poured to him from the largest goblet. Chloe <lb/>
            sang; while Daphnis piped.</p>
          <p>Having discharged their religious rites, they were <lb/>
            reclining on the grass and feasting, when Philetas the <lb/>
            herdsman accidentally came by, bringing with him some <lb/>
            garlands, and vine-branches, laden with their clusters, as <lb/>
            offerings to Pan. Tityrus, his youngest son, a golden- <lb/>
            haired, blue-eyed, fair and sportive boy followed him. At <lb/>
            the sight of Philetas, Daphnis and Chloe sprang from their <lb/>
            grassy couch, assisted in crowning Pan, and in suspending <lb/>
            the clusters to the tree, and then made Philetas seat himself <lb/>
            by them, and join in their carousal. Very soon, as old <lb/>
            men do when their clay is moistened,. they began to talk of <lb/>
            their youthful adventures, of the flocks which they had fed, <lb/>
            of incursions of marauders, which they had escaped in the <lb/>
            days when they were young. One prided himself on having <lb/>
            slain a wolf: another boasted, that in piping he was second <lb/>
            to Pan alone.-This was the boast of Philetas.</p>
          <p>Daphnis and Chloe used urgent entreaties that he would <lb/>
            teach them the art, and that he would play on the pipe at <lb/>
            the festival of that deity, who delights in its melody. The <lb/>
            old man complained that nge had shortened his powers of <lb/>
            breath, but complied with their request, and took up the <lb/>
            pipe of Daphnis. It was a pipe too small to do justice to <lb/>
            so great an art; being suited only for a boy. Accordingly <lb/>
            he despatched Tityrus to bring his own pipe from the cot­ <lb/>
            tage, which was rather more than a mile off. The bov threw <lb/>
            aside his cloak,† and darted off like a young fawn. tarn on, <lb/>
            in the mean time, promised to amuse them with the legend <lb/>
            of the Syrinx,‡ (or pipe) which he had heard from a Sicilian <lb/>
            shepherd, who received a he-goat and a pipe as the price of <lb/>
            his song.</p>

            and melodious voice. She fed her flocks, she sported with <lb/>
            the Nymphs, and the sound of her voice was sweet as it is <lb/>
            now. Pan beheld the maiden feeding her flocks, disporting <lb/>
            herself, and singing. He approached her, and endeavoured <figure type="illustration">

              to win her to his will, promising her as an enticement that <lb/>
              all her she-goats should bear two kids at a birth. The <lb/>
              maiden laughed at his suit, and replied that she would never <lb/>
              think of accepting as a lover, one who was neither man nor <lb/>
              goat, but a compound half of each.—Pan was preparing to <lb/>
              offer violence: the maiden fled from him, and when weary <lb/>
              with running, hid herself among the reeds of a lake and <lb/>
              disappeared. Her pursuer in a rage cut the reeds, but <lb/>
              finding no damsel there, and perceiving what had taken place, <lb/>
              he in memory of her formed this instrument . Compacting <lb/>
              with wax unequal reeds in order to shew how the course of <lb/>
              their love had not run smooth..-Thus she, who was once <lb/>
              a beauteous maiden, is now a musical pipe: the instrument <lb/>
              inheriting her name."</p>
          <p>While Philctas was commending Lamon’s legend, which, <lb/>
            he said, was more pleasing than any song, Tityrus appeared <lb/>
            with his father's pipe, a large instrument formed of the largest <lb/>
            reeds, and ornamented with brass over the junctures of the <lb/>
            wax. A person might have imagined it to be the very pipe <lb/>
            whose reeds had been first united by Pan. Philetas rose <lb/>
            up, placed himself upon a seat in an erect posture, and <lb/>
            began to try whether the reeds were in good order: he found <lb/>
            the air pass through them freely, and then with as much <lb/>
            energy as if he had been in the prime of youth, he blew a <lb/>
            note so vigorous and full, that it appeared like a band of <lb/>
            pipers playing in concert. By degrees he moderated the <lb/>
            vehemence of his tones, and turned them into a softer <lb/>
            strain. Ho ran through all the variations of pastoral <lb/>
            melody; he played the tune, which the oxen obey, that <lb/>
            which attracts the goats, that in which the sheep delight. <lb/>
            The notes for the sheep were sweet, those for the oxen <lb/>
            deep, those for the goats were shrill. In short, his single pipe <lb/>
            could express the tones of every pipe which is played upon.</p>
          <p>Those present lay listening in silent delight; when Dryas <lb/>
            rose up, and desired Philetas to strike up the Bacchanalian <lb/>
            tune. Philetas obeyed, and Dryas began t the VINTAGE­ <figure type="illustration">

              DANCE, in which he represented the plucking of the grapes, <lb/>
              the carrying of the baskets,—the treading of the clusters, <lb/>
              the filling of the casks, and the drinking of the new-made <lb/>
              wine. All this Dryas imitated so closely and admirably <lb/>
              in his pantomimic dance, that the spectator might fancy the <lb/>
              wines, the wine-press, and the casks to be actually before <lb/>
              him, and that Dryas was drinking in reality.</p>
          <p>Each of the three old men had now severally distinguished <lb/>
            himself. Dryas, in his delight gave Daphnis and Chloe a <lb/>
            kiss, who immediately sprang from their seats, and began <lb/>
            to dance a ballet representative of Lamon's fable. Daphnis <lb/>
            assumed the character of Pan, and Chloe that of Syrinx. <lb/>
            While he endeavoured to entice her to his embraces, she <lb/>
            smiled in scorn at his attempts . lie pursued her, and <lb/>
            ran upon his tiptoes in imitation of the cloven feet of the <lb/>
            god: while she making a semblance of exhaustion, at last <lb/>
            hid herself in the wood, making it a substitute for reedy lake. <lb/>
            Upon losing sight of her, Daphnis seizing the large pipe of <lb/>
            Philetas, breathed into it a mournful strain as of one who <lb/>
            loves; then a love-sick strain as of one who pleads; lastly and <lb/>
            recalling strain, as of one who seeks her whom he has lost.</p>
          <p>Philetas himself was astonished, and ran and embraced <lb/>
            the youth and kissed him : and with a prayer, that Daphnis <lb/>
            might transmit the pipe to as worthy a successor, bestowed <lb/>
            it on hint as a gift. The youth suspended his own pipe as <lb/>
            an offering to Pan, kissed Chloe with as much ardour as if <lb/>
            she had really been lost and found again, and led his flocks <lb/>
            home by the sound of his new instrument. Chloe also <lb/>
            (as night was coming on) conducted her sheep homeward <lb/>
            to the music of her pipe. The goats kept close by the <lb/>
            sheep, as Daphnis kept close by Chloe. In this manner did <lb/>
            they enjoy each other's company, till night-fall, when they <lb/>
            agreed to meet earlier at the pasture the next morning, an <lb/>
            arrangement which they punctually fulfilled. As soon as <lb/>
            the day dawned, they were in the fields. They paid their <lb/>
            adorations to the Nymphs first, and then to Pan, afterwards <lb/>
            retiring from their devotions to their seat under the shade <lb/>
            of the oak, where they played their accustomed melodies. <lb/>
            They interchanged kisses and embraces, and lay down side­ <lb/>
            by-side, but this was all; then rising, they bethought them <lb/>
            of their meal, at which they partook of milk and wine.</p><pb n="305"/>
            
          <p>Becoming gradually warmed and emboldened by all this <lb/>
            they began to enter into an amorous revelry, and to swear <lb/>
            perpetual affection and fidelity. Daphnis advanced to the <lb/>
            sacred pine, and called Pan to witness, that he would never <lb/>
            live apart from his Chloe—no—not for the space of a single <lb/>
            day. Chloe entered the Grotto, and swore by the Nymphs, <lb/>
            that she would live and die with Daphnis: and in the sim­ <lb/>
            plicity of her heart, upon coming out, she required that <lb/>
            Daphnis should bind himself by a second oath ;“ for," (said <lb/>
            the maiden) “my dear Daphnis, Pan himself, by whom <lb/>
            you swore, is a lover, and yet unfaithful. lie loved <lb/>
            Pitys, he loved Syrinx, and yet he never ceases from pestering <lb/>
            the Dryads with his addresses, or from causing annoyance <lb/>
            to the Epimelian Nymphs, the guardians of our herds. He <lb/>
            who breaks his own vows will hardly punish you, even if <lb/>
            you should attach yourself to more damsels than there are <lb/>
            reeds in this pipe . Come, dearest Daphnis, you must swear <lb/>
            by this herd and by the she-goat, which nursed you, that, <lb/>
            while Chloe is faithful to you, you will never desert her; <lb/>
            on the other hand if Chloe should ever do despite to you, <lb/>
            and to the Nymphs—fly from her—detest her-kill her, <lb/>
            as you would kill a wolf."</p>
          <p>Daphnis, delighted even at her mistrust, which shewed <lb/>
            the warmth of her affection, placed himself in the midst <lb/>
            of his herd, and taking hold of a she-goat with one hand, <lb/>
            and a he-goat with the other, swore to be true to Chloe, <lb/>
            while she was true to him; and that if she should ever prefer <lb/>
            another before him, he would put an end not to her but <lb/>
            to himself.</p>
          <p>Chloe was happy :-for she believed him with all the sim­ <lb/>
            plicity of a girl, and of a shepherdess, and of one who <lb/>
            thought that the sheep and the goats were the fitting and <lb/>
            peculiar deities of those who tended them.</p>

          <p>WHEN the Inhabitants of Mitylene heard or the descent <lb/>
            made by the ten vessels, and had been informed by some <lb/>
            coming from the spot of the plunder which had been carried <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            off, they were of opinion that such an injury on the part of <lb/>
            the Methymnœans was insufferable, and immediately raised <lb/>
            a force of three thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry, <lb/>
            which they put under the command of Hippasus with orders, <lb/>
            that he should lead his men by land, and not embark them <lb/>
            on board of ship, as a voyage in the winter season would be <lb/>
            dangerous.</p>
          <p>The general began his march, but he did not lay waste <lb/>
            the country of the enemy, nor did he plunder the possessions <lb/>
            of the husbandman, or of the shepherd, thinking such petty <lb/>
            warfare suitable to a captain of a banditti, rather than to <lb/>
            the leader of an army. He hastened his march in order <lb/>
            to reach the gates of the city and attack the inhabitants <lb/>
            while they were off their guard. ’When his troops ap­ <lb/>
            proached within eleven miles of the city, a herald came <lb/>
            out to them with proposals for a truce. The Methymnæans <lb/>
            had discovered from the prisoners, that the citizens of Mity­ <lb/>
            lene were ignorant of the beginning of the affray,. and that <lb/>
            the insolence of their own young men had drawn upon them <lb/>
            the vengeance inflicted by the herdsmen and shepherds. <lb/>
            They repented, accordingly, of having acted precipitately <lb/>
            rather than prudently towards a neighbouring city, and were <lb/>
            desirous to restore all their plunder, in order that friendly <lb/>
            intercourse bv sea and land might be restored. Although <lb/>
            Hippasus had full powers given him of acting as he thought <lb/>
            proper, lie ordered the herald to proceed to Mitylene, while <lb/>
            he pitched his camp about a mile from the enemy's city, <lb/>
            and waited for the answer of his fellow-citizens. In two <lb/>
            days a messenger arrived with orders for him to refrain from <lb/>
            any act of hostility, to receive the restored booty, and to <lb/>
            return home; for since the declaration of peace or war rested <lb/>
            on the decision of the people, they considered peace far <lb/>
            preferable.</p>
          <p>Thus did the war between Methymne and Mitylene begin <lb/>
            and end in an equally unexpected manner.</p>
          <p>Winter, however, was more formidable to Daphnis and <lb/>
            Chloe, than war had been. On a sudden heavy falls of snow <lb/>
            blocked up the roads, and shut up the cottagers within <lb/>
            doors. Impetuous torrents rushed down from the moun­ <note type="footnote"> * The reading here followed is that of Villoisun.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ύβίζοντας τοὺς <lb/>

            tains, the ice thickened, the trees* seemed as though their <lb/>
            branches were broken down beneath the weight of snow, <lb/>
            and the whole face of the earth had disappeared except about <lb/>
            the brinks of fountains and the borders of rivers.</p>
          <p>No one led his flocks to pasture, or even ventured to stir <lb/>
            from home; but lighting large fires, at cock-crowing, some <lb/>
            employed themselves in twisting ropes, some in weaving <lb/>
            goats' hair, and some in making snares and nets to catch <lb/>
            birds. At the same time they took care to supply the oxen <lb/>
            in their stalls with chaff, the goats and sheep in their <lb/>
            cotes with leaves, and the hogs in their styes with holm­ <lb/>
            berries and acorns.</p>
          <p>As every one was of necessity confined within-doors,† <lb/>
            most of the labourers and shepherds were glad at having <lb/>
            an interval of release from their wonted labours, and im­ <lb/>
            mediately after their morning-meal lay down, and enjoyed <lb/>
            a lengthy sleep, winter appearing to them more pleasant <lb/>
            than the summer, the autumn, or even the spring. But <lb/>
            Daphnis and Chloe cherished in their memory the pleasures, <lb/>
            of which they were now deprived,—their kisses, their em­ <lb/>
            braces, and their happy meals together. They passed nights <lb/>
            of sleeplessness and sorrow, and looked for the return of <lb/>
            spring as a restoration to life after an interval of death. It <lb/>
            was painful to them, if chance threw in their way a scrip, <lb/>
            from which they had eaten, or a vessel from which they had <lb/>
            drunk, or if they happened to cast their eyes on a pipe, now <lb/>
            thrown aside with neglect, which had once been bestowed <lb/>
            and received as a token of love. Frequent were their prayers <lb/>
            to the Nymphs, and to Pan, to deliver them from their <lb/>
            troubles, and once more to let the sun shine upon them and <note type="footnote"> * “neo jam susteneant onus <lb/>

            their herds, and while thus engaged they also endeavoured <lb/>
            to devise some scheme, by which they might obtain a sight <lb/>
            of one another. Chloe was quite at a loss, and could not <lb/>
            contrive any plan, successfully, for her reputed mother <lb/>
            was always sitting near her, teaching her to card wool <lb/>
            and to turn the spindle, and touching upon the subject of <lb/>
            marriage.</p>
          <p>Daphnis, however, had greater quickness of invention, and <lb/>
            more leisure than the maiden, and hit upon the following <lb/>
            scheme for getting a sight of Chloo. Two lofty myrtle trees <lb/>
            and an ivy grow before Dryas's cottage, and indeed under the <lb/>
            very cottage itself. The ivy grew between the myrtle trees, <lb/>
            throwing out on either side, its sprays like a vine, and <lb/>
            forming an arbour by intermingling its leaves with theirs. <lb/>
            The berries hung down in thick clusters, and were as largo <lb/>
            as grapes. Numbers of winter birds flocked thither from <lb/>
            want of food elsewhere; such as blackbirds, thrushes, wood­ <lb/>
            pigeons, starlings, and a variety of others, which live on <lb/>
            berries. Daphnis filled his scrip with some honeyed cakes, <lb/>
            and quitted his homo under pretence of going to catch some <lb/>
            of these birds. To remove all suspicion of his real design <lb/>
            he carried with him plenty of birdlime and snares. The dis­ <lb/>
            tance was little more than a mile, but the frost and the snow, <lb/>
            which had not yet melted, rendered the road very toilsome. <lb/>
            To LOVE, however, all things are passable—fire, and water, <lb/>
            and even Scythian snows. Having soon arrived at the <lb/>
            cottage, he shook the snow from his legs and feet, set the <lb/>
            snares, spread the birdlime, and seated himself in the arbour <lb/>
            watching the birds, but thinking of Chloe. So many were <lb/>
            very soon caught, that he had abundance of occupation <lb/>
            in collecting them together, killing and plucking them. <lb/>
            In the mean time, not a man, not a maiden, not even a <lb/>
            domestic fowl came out of the cottage: the whole family <lb/>
            were shut up and close around the fire. Daphnis was now <lb/>
            utterly at a loss what to do, and thought that he had come <lb/>
            at an unlucky time. He determined to knock at the door <lb/>
            if he could find any pretext, and began to consider what <lb/>
            would appear most plausible. " What, if I say that I want a <lb/>
            light to kindle our fire? they will reply ‛you have neigh­ <lb/>
            bours within a stone's throw of your cottage.' What, if I <lb/>
            request something to eat P—‛ your scrip is full of victuals.' <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            What, if I ask for some wine ?—‛you have but lately got in <lb/>
            the vintage.’ What, if I exclaim that a wolf has been pursu­ <lb/>
            ing me ?—‛ where are the traces of his feet ?' What, if I teL <lb/>
            them I came to snare birds?—‛ why not go home again, if <lb/>
            you have had sport enough ?' Shall I at once say that I <lb/>
            have come to see Chloe? Ah! who will venture to make <lb/>
            such a bold avowal to the father and mother of the maiden? <lb/>
            My pleas will be all exhausted and I shall be reduced to <lb/>
            silence. Since none of these excuses will pass free from <lb/>
            suspicion, it were better to hold my tongue. It seems <lb/>
            decreed by the Fates that I shall not see my Chloe during <lb/>
            the winter; I must wait with patience until the spring."</p>
          <p>After indulging in some such thoughts as these, he took <lb/>
            up his game, and was preparing to depart, when, as if Love <lb/>
            took pity on him, the following occurrence happened.</p>
          <p>The family within had spread their table: the meat was <lb/>
            portioned out; a slice of bread was placed for each, and the <lb/>
            goblet was ready mixed. One of the sheep-dogs, who had <lb/>
            watched his opportunity, when no person was observing <lb/>
            him, seized a piece of meat, and made his escape. <lb/>
            Dry as (for the stolen meat happened to be his portion) <lb/>
            snatched up a club, and pursued the thief, following him up <lb/>
            like a second dog. Daphnis had thrown the birds over his <lb/>
            shoulder, and was just about hurrying away when Dryas <lb/>
            espied him. At the sight of Daphnis he immediately forgot <lb/>
            both meat and dog, called out after him, " Good morrow, my <lb/>
            son ! " ran to him, embraced him, took him by the hand, and <lb/>
            led him into the house. When the lovers saw each other, <lb/>
            they were very near sinking to the ground ; however, they <lb/>
            continued to support themselves, while they saluted and <lb/>
            embraced: indeed their embrace acted as a stay, and pre­ <lb/>
            vented them from falling.</p>
          <p>Having thus contrary to his expectation obtained an <lb/>
            interview with his Chloe and a kiss, Daphnis drew nearer to <lb/>
            the fire, and sat down: then taking the woodpigeons and <lb/>
            thrushes from his shoulder threw them upon the table, <lb/>
            while he related to the family the weariness which he felt <lb/>
            from so long and tedious a confinement at home, tho cager­ <lb/>
            ness with which he set out in pursuit of some sport, and the <lb/>
            manner in which he caught the birds, some with a snare, <lb/>
            some with birdlime, when they came in search of the myrtle <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            and ivy berries. The family praised his activity, and com­ <lb/>
            pared him to “Apollo the far-darting;" and urged him to <lb/>
            partake of what the dog had fortunately left; desiring Chloe <lb/>
            in the mean time to pour him out wherewithal to drink. <lb/>
            She cheerfully complied and handed the goblet to all the <lb/>
            others first, last of all to Daphnis, pretending to be affronted <lb/>
            with him, for having come thither and intending to go <lb/>
            away without asking to see her: nevertheless, before hold­ <lb/>
            ing the beaker out to him, the sipped. a little from it, and <lb/>
            then presented it; upon which be, although thirsty, drank <lb/>
            as leisurely as possible, in order to prolong his pleasure, by <lb/>
            protracting his draught.</p>
          <p>The table was soon cleared of the fragments of bread and <lb/>
            meat: after which, as they were sitting by the fire, they <lb/>
            began to inquire after Myrtale and Lamon, who were pro­ <lb/>
            nounced fortunate in having such an excellent provider for <lb/>
            their old age. Daphnis was delighted at having these com­ <lb/>
            mendations pronounced upon him in the hearing of Chloe, <lb/>
            and when her parents proceeded to insist upon his remaining <lb/>
            with them till next day, when they intended to sacrifice <lb/>
            to Bacchus, he was very nearly adoring them in lieu of the <lb/>
            god. He immediately produced his store of honeyed cakes <lb/>
            from his scrip, together with the birds, which be had <lb/>
            caught, which they dressed for supper. A second goblet <lb/>
            was mixed; and a second fire was lighted. Night soon came <lb/>
            on, when they partook of a hearty meal; and at its conclu­ <lb/>
            sion, after telling stories, and singing songs, they retired to <lb/>
            rest. Chloe slept with her mother, and Daphnis with Dryas. <lb/>
            Chloe's only pleasure was the thought of seeing Daphnis the <lb/>
            next morning; Daphnis enjoyed a kind of hollow satisfaction, <lb/>
            even from sleeping with Chloe's father, whom he hugged <lb/>
            and kissed, dreaming all the while, that the embraces were <lb/>
            being bestowed upon Chloe.</p>
          <p>When the day broke the cold was intense, and the sharp <lb/>
            north wind was parching up every thing. Dryas and his <lb/>
            family arose, sacrificed a ram of one year old to Bacchus, and <lb/>
            lighted a large fire to boil the meat. Nape nUde the bread, <note type="footnote"> * “ Fac primus rapias illius tacta labellis <lb/>
            Pooula: quaque bibit parte puella, bibe." <lb/>

             <pb n="311"/>
            while Dryas attended to the meat, and, while they were thus <lb/>
            engaged, Daphnis and Cbloe proceeded to the ivy-covered <lb/>
            arbour, where they set snares and spread birdlime, and again <lb/>
            caught no small quantity of birds. Kisses and delightful <lb/>
            converse were continuously interchanged between them.</p>
          <p>" I came hither entirely on your account, Chloe."</p>
          <p>" I know it, my dear Daphnis."</p>
          <p>" On your account it is that these poor blackbirds now <lb/>
            perish; what place have I in your affections ? Do think <lb/>
            of me!"</p>
          <p>" I do think of you, my Daphnis, I swear it by the Nymphs <lb/>
            whom I once invoked in that Grotto, whither wo will repair <lb/>
            again so soon as the snow shall have melted.”</p>
          <p>“The snow lies very thick; I fear that I shall melt away, <lb/>
            before it does."</p>
          <p>" Do not despair, Daphnis, the sun is very warm.”</p>
          <p>" Would that it were as warm as the fire which burns my <lb/>
            heart !”</p>
          <p>" You are in jest: your are deceiving me, Daphnis.”</p>
          <p>" No! I am not; I swear it by the goats, whom nt your <lb/>
            bidding I invoked.”</p>
          <p>Chloe's reply was an echo to what Daphnis said. Nape <lb/>
            now calling them, they hurried into the house with a <lb/>
            much larger supply of game than Daphnis had taken the <lb/>
            day before. First pouring out a libation to Bacchus, from <lb/>
            the goblet, they sat down to their banquet with chaplets of <lb/>
            ivy on their heads. When it was time to part, after loudly <lb/>
            shouting in honour of the god, Daphnis took his leave, <lb/>
            Dryas and his wife having filled his bag with meat and <lb/>
            bread, and insisting upon his carrying the wood-pigeons and <lb/>
            thrushes home to Lamon and Myrtale ; for, as they said, they <lb/>
            should be able to catch as many as they pleased so long as <lb/>
            the cold lasted and the ivy berries did not fail. At length <lb/>
            Daphnis bade them farewell, and at his departure gave each <lb/>
            of them a kiss, but he saluted Chloe last of all, that her kiss <lb/>
            might remain pure and unalloyed upon his lips.</p>
          <p>He freqently found out pretences for paying them fresh <lb/>
            visits; so that the winter did not pass by altogether without <lb/>
            an interchange of love.</p>
          <p>In the opening of spring, when the snow was melted, the <lb/>
            face of the earth again uncovered and the grass beginning <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            to grow ,* the shepherds and herdsmen led forth their flocks <lb/>
            to the pastures, but Daphne and Chloe were earlier than the <lb/>
            others, inasmuch as they were under the guidance of a <lb/>
            mightier shepherd (Love). The first place to which they <lb/>
            hastened, was the grotto of the Nymphs ; the next was the <lb/>
            pine-tree, where stood the statue of Pan; they then proceeded <lb/>
            to the oak, under which, sitting down, they watched their <lb/>
            feeding flocks, and kissed and embraced each other. Wishing <lb/>
            to crown the statues of the deities, they sought for flowers : <lb/>
            these were but just beginning to come out under the mild <lb/>
            influence of the zephyr, and the genial warmth of the sun ; <lb/>
            but they found the violet, the narcissus, and the pimpernel, <lb/>
            and all the other firstlings of the year: with these they <lb/>
            crowned the statues, and then poured out libations of new <lb/>
            milk drawn from the ewes and the she-goats. After this <lb/>
            ceremony they began to tune their pastoral pipes, as <lb/>
            though challenging the nightingales to resume their song : <lb/>
            these answered softly from the thickets, and gradually <lb/>
            became perfect in their plaintive strains, as if recalling <lb/>
            them slowly after so long a silence: t</p>
          <p>The sheep were heard bleating, while the lambs were seen <lb/>
            to frisk about, or stooping under their mothers drew the <lb/>
            teat; the rams pursued and leaped upon those which had <lb/>
            never lambed. The he-goats did the like, contending for <lb/>
            their mates, each making choice of his own, and guarding <lb/>
            her from the approach of a rival.</p>
          <p>All these objects might have kindled love even in hoary <lb/>
            age ; they who were in the bloom of youth, full of vigour, <lb/>
            and long since warmed by desire, were inflamed by such <note type="footnote"> * “ Diffugere nives, redeunt jam gramina campis <lb/>

            sounds, melted at such nights, and longed for something <lb/>
            beyond a kiss and an embrace.</p>
          <p>Especially was this the case with Daphnis. He had <lb/>
            passed the whole winter in the house, and in a state of inac­ <lb/>
            tivity, he therefore was more impetuous than ever in his <lb/>
            desire for kissing and embracing Chloe, and became bolder <lb/>
            and more inquisitive in all love matters. He urged her to <lb/>
            grant him all his wishes ; and proposed that they should lie <lb/>
            side by side, naked, since of the precepts given by Philetas <lb/>
            for curing love, this remained untried. She inquired what <lb/>
            there possibly could be besides kisses, embraces, and re­ <lb/>
            clining side by side; why did he wish that they should <lb/>
            recline together naked ?</p>
          <p>“ I wish," said he " to follow the example of the rams and <lb/>
            ewes; of the male goats and their females.—After their <lb/>
            amorous sport, the females no longer flee, and the males no <lb/>
            longer pursue; but both feed quietly together, as if they <lb/>
            felt a mutual pleasure. There must be some gratification <lb/>
            in what they do; something which cures the sting of love." * <lb/>
            “ But," returned Chloe, “ the postures of the sheep and <lb/>
            goats are very different from ours; the males leap upon the <lb/>
            females from behind; this is out of the question with us; <lb/>
            besides, you wish me to lie beside you naked, whereas they <lb/>
            have a thick covering given them by nature."</p>
          <p>Daphnis admitted the reasonableness of this ; so after <lb/>
            lying by her side, as usual, for a considerable time, ignorant <lb/>
            how to gratify his passions, he got up and actually shed <lb/>
            tears, at being less expert in love than a silly sheep.</p>
          <p>They had a neighbour named Chromis, who farmed some <lb/>
            land of his own. lie was growing old, but his wife, who <lb/>
            came from the city, was young, good looking, and superior <lb/>
            in manners to the common rustics; her name was Lycæ­ <lb/>
            nium. Seeing Daphnis driving his goats past her house, <lb/>
            conducting them to pasture in the morning, and home again <note type="footnote"> * “ Recti illi faciunt, rectæ contra istæ patiuntur alteri, nempe insi­ <lb/>

            in the evening, she was very desirous of enticing him into <lb/>
            love by means of presents.</p>
          <p>Upon one occasion, watching until be was alone, she gave <lb/>
            him a pipe, a honeycomb, and a scrip of deer-skin. She did <lb/>
            not say anything at the time, suspecting his affection for <lb/>
            Chloe, by seeing him always in her company. Hitherto, <lb/>
            however, her knowledge of the fact was founded only upon <lb/>
            having seen nods and laughter exchanged between them. <lb/>
            Not long after, pretending to Chromis in the morning <lb/>
            that she was going to visit a neighbour in the pains of <lb/>
            childbirth, she followed the lovers, and concealed herself in <lb/>
            a thicket, in order to avoid discovery; from thence she saw <lb/>
            and heard everything which passed between them, and was <lb/>
            a witness of the tears shed by Daphnis under his disappoint­ <lb/>
            ment. Commiserating their trouble, and conceiving the <lb/>
            present a good opportunity to promote their wishes, and to <lb/>
            gratify her own desires, sibe had recourse to the following <lb/>
            expedient.</p>
          <p>The next morning, under cover of the same excuse as <lb/>
            on the previous day, she went straight to the oak where <lb/>
            Daphnis and Chloe were sitting together; then admirably <lb/>
            counterfeiting a state of great alarm, she exclaimed, " Come <lb/>
            to ray aid, I entreat you, Daphnis, an eagle has carried off <lb/>
            the finest among my twenty geese; and unable to bear it to <lb/>
            yonder high rock, has fallen with it in the neighbouring low <lb/>
            wood. In the name of Pan and the Nymphs come into <lb/>
            the wood and rescue my goose, I am afraid to enter it by <lb/>
            myself. Do not let file have my number made imperfect; <lb/>
            besides you may perhaps kill the eagle, and will then no <lb/>
            longer be in dread of having your lambs carried away. <lb/>
            Chloe will, in the meantime, mind your flocks, the goats <lb/>
            know her as well as they do you, from your being always in <lb/>
            company.”</p>
          <p>Daphnis, having no suspicions of her motives, got up and <lb/>
            followed Lycænium, who led him as far as possible from <lb/>
            Chloe; upon arriving in the thickest of the wood, near a <lb/>
            fountain, she bid him sit down beside her.—“You are in <lb/>
            love, Daphnis," she said; " the Nymphs informed me of this, <lb/>
            last night; they told me of the tears which you shed yester­ <lb/>
            day, and have commanded me, for the sake of your relief, <lb/>
            to teach you love's mysteries, These are not limited to <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            kisses and embraces, and the doing what is done by the <lb/>
            rams and goats; # they result in much greater pleasure, and <lb/>
            are longer in duration. If, therefore, you wish to be freed <lb/>
            from your pains, and to make trial of the sweets which you <lb/>
            so long for, you must become my willing pupil, and out of <lb/>
            regard to the Nymphs I will be your instructress." Daph­ <lb/>
            nis could scarcely contain himself for joy, but rustic as he <lb/>
            was, a goatherd, young and in love, he threw himself at <lb/>
            Lycænium’s feet, entreating her to teach him with all speed <lb/>
            the art of gratifying his passion for Chloe.—Moreover, as if <lb/>
            about to learn something very mysterious and wonderful, <lb/>
            he promised to reward her pains with a kid, some cheeses <lb/>
            made of the first new milk, and the she-goat herself. Find­ <lb/>
            ing the young shepherd so liberal in his offers, she began <lb/>
            to tutor him. She made him sit close to her, bidding him <lb/>
            kiss and embrace her, and lastly lie down beside her, as was <lb/>
            his wont with Chloe. After this, seeing his amorous ardour, <lb/>
            she received him into her arms, and, aided by nature, led <lb/>
            him to the wished-for consummation.†</p>
          <p>When this amorous lesson was concluded, Daphnis, in his <lb/>
            simplicity, was upon the point of hurrying back to Chloe, <lb/>
            to put in practice what he had learnt, for fear least through <lb/>
            delaying he might forget it. Lycænium however stopped <lb/>
            him, saying,—“ You have something more yet to learn, <lb/>
            Daphnis,—I am a full grown woman, and have felt no <lb/>
            inconvenience from what has taken place; I was instructed <lb/>
            in this art by another man, who received my maidenhead as <lb/>
            his reward;—but Chloe, when she engages in this amorous <lb/>
            contest, will cry out, and shed tears, and suffer incon­ <lb/>
            venience ; however, you must not mind all this; so when <lb/>
            you find her in a compliant humour, bring her to this <lb/>
            wood, where you will be free from all intrusion,-and <lb/>
            remember, that you have had me for your instructress <note type="footnote"> * Saltus hi longo illis dulciores; habent enim longioris temporis <lb/>

            previous to Chloe.* Lycænium, after giving him this advice, <lb/>
            retired to another part of the wood as if still in search of <lb/>
            the lost goose. Daphnis, reflecting upon what she had said, <lb/>
            restrained his former impetuosity,† fearing to be the cause <lb/>
            of any pain and inconvenience to Chloe; and determining <lb/>
            to solace himself with her only in the accustomed man­ <lb/>
            ner, he issued from the wood. Upon his return he found <lb/>
            her weaving a chaplet of violets; so, pretending that he had <lb/>
            delivered the goose from the talons of the eagle, he threw <lb/>
            his arms around her and embraced her, since in this at least <lb/>
            there could be no danger. She placed the chaplet upon his <lb/>
            head, and kissed his hair, which, in her estimation was far <lb/>
            preferable to the violets. Then producing from her scrip a <lb/>
            cake of figs and bread, she gave him some, then snatching <lb/>
            the morsels from his mouth, eat them herself, like the <lb/>
            youngling of a bird.</p>
          <p>While they were at their meal, which, however, consisted <lb/>
            more of kisses than of food, a fishing boat was seen pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding along the coast. There was no wind stirring; a <lb/>
            perfect calm prevailed: so having taken to their oars, the <lb/>
            crew were rowing vigorously, their object being to carry <lb/>
            some newly caught fish to a rich man in the city. They <lb/>
            dipped their oars, doing what sailors usually do to beguile <lb/>
            their toil.‡ The boatswain sung a sea-song, and the rest <note type="footnote"> * “ Jacebit baud secus ac vulnerata, multo manens sanguine.—Ve­ <lb/>

            joined in chorus at stated intervals. When they were in <lb/>
            the open sea, the sound was lost, their voices being dis­ <lb/>
            persed into the air, but when running under a he and <lb/>
            they came into any hollow and crescent-shaped bay, the <lb/>
            sound became much louder, and the song of the boatswain <lb/>
            was distinctly heard on shore. A deep valley here sloped <lb/>
            down from the plain above, which received into it the sound, <lb/>
            as into an instrument of music, and repeated with the most <lb/>
            perfect imitation every note which was uttered. There <lb/>
            could be heard the distinction between the dash of the oars, <lb/>
            and the voices of the sailors; and a very pleasing sound it <lb/>
            was; beginning on the sea, the duration of its echo upon <lb/>
            shore was proportioned to its greater lateness in com­ <lb/>
            mencing.</p>
          <p>Daphnis, understanding the nature of the echo, turned <lb/>
            his attention solely to the sea, and was delighted with <lb/>
            viewing the boat as it glided by the shore quicker than <lb/>
            a bird could fly. At the same time he endeavoured to store <lb/>
            up some of these strains in his memory, that he might <lb/>
            play them on his pipe. Chloe, who had never, till now, <lb/>
            heard what is called an echo, turned first to the sea, and <lb/>
            listened to the boatmen, as they sang, and then looked <lb/>
            round to the woods, in expectation of seeing those, who (as <lb/>
            she thought) were singing in responsive chorus.</p>
          <p>At length the rowers were out of sight, and all was <lb/>
            silent, even in the valley; when Chloe inquired of Daph­ <lb/>
            nis whether there was another sea behind the hill, and <lb/>
            another boat, and other sailors, who all sang the same <lb/>
            strain, and who all left off together. Daphnis sweetly <lb/>
            smiled upon her, and gave her a still sweeter kiss, and <lb/>
            putting the chaplet of violets on her head, proceeded to <lb/>
            relate to her the legendary tale of Echo, upon condition <lb/>
            of receiving ten kisses for his pains.</p>
          <p>“ There are various classes of the Nymphs, my love <lb/>
            the Melians, who dwell among the ash-groves, the Dryads, <lb/>
            who preside over the oaks, and the Elœan, who are guard­ <lb/>
            ians of the lakes. Echo. was the daughter of one of these <lb/>
            Nymphs: as her mother was beautiful, so was she, but as <lb/>
            her father was a mortal, she also was the same. She was <note type="footnote"> * See Ovid, Met. iii. 35G, for the legend of Echo and Narcissus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            brought up by the Nymphs, and was taught by the Muses <lb/>
            to play upon the pipe, the flute, the lyre, and the harp, <lb/>
            in short she was instructed in every species of music; <lb/>
            so that when the maiden arrived at the flower of her <lb/>
            youth, she danced with the Nymphs, and sang with the <lb/>
            Muses. Attached to the state of maidenhood, she shunned <lb/>
            the sight of all males, whether men or gods. This roused <lb/>
            the indignation of Pan; jealous of her skill in music, and <lb/>
            irritated by her refusal of his advances, the god inspired <lb/>
            the shepherds and herdsmen with such frenzy, that they <lb/>
            rushed upon her like so many hounds or wolves, tore her <lb/>
            in pieces, and threw in every direction, her limbs, yet <lb/>
            seeding forth melodious sounds. Earth, in order to gratify <lb/>
            the Nymphs, covered the maiden's limbs, but preserved to <lb/>
            her the gift of song; and, by the will of the Muses, she <lb/>
            still has the power of utterance, and, as when alive, still <lb/>
            imitates all sounds; the voices of the gods-of men—of <lb/>
            instruments—of animals, even of Pan himself when playing <lb/>
            on his pipe. He, when he hears the sound, springs up, <lb/>
            and rushes in pursuit over the mountains, not in order to <lb/>
            bend her to his wishes, but to find out who can be this his <lb/>
            hidden pupil."</p>
          <p>When Daphnis had finished his tale, Chloe, instead of <lb/>
            giving him ten kisses only,* bestowed upon him a thousand; <lb/>
            and Echo repeated every kiss, as if in testimony that Daph­ <lb/>
            nis had not added anything to her history, which was not true.</p>
          <p>The heat of the weather daily increased, since spring <lb/>
            was departing, and summer was approaching. The new <lb/>
            delights, which this season brings, again returned to them. <lb/>
            Daphnis swam in the rivers, and Chloe bathed in the <lb/>
            fountains; he played upon the pipe, vying with the murmur­ <lb/>
            ing pine-trees; she sang, and emulated the nightingales with <lb/>
            her melody: they chased the noisy locusts, they caught the <lb/>
            chirping grasshoppers, they gathered posies, or shook down <lb/>
            the fruit from the trees, and ato it. Sometimes, also, they <lb/>
            lay side by side, covered with a goat-skin; but fearing <lb/>
            lest passion might carry him away, Daphnis would not <lb/>
            often permit her to display all her beauties ; at which she <lb/>
            in her innocence was astonished, but said nothing. <note type="footnote"> * There is a painting, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which represents <lb/>
            Venus as chiding Cupid for learning arithmetic. </note> <pb n="319"/>
            </p>
          <p>During the summer, Chloe had many suitors, who came <lb/>
            to Dryas, and entreated him to bestow his daughter in <lb/>
            marriage. Some brought with them a gift, and some made <lb/>
            great promises. Nape, elated with hope, advised her hus­ <lb/>
            band to marry Chloe forthwith, and not to keep a maiden <lb/>
            of her age any longer at home, lest, while pasturing her <lb/>
            flocks, she should some day lose her virtue, and take to her­ <lb/>
            self a partner upon the strength of a present of fruit or <lb/>
            flowers; * the best course was to secure for her a good <lb/>
            match, and to keep all the presents of her suitors for the <lb/>
            infant son who had been lately born to them.</p>
          <p>Dry as was sometimes almost persuaded by her argu­ <lb/>
            ments, for the gifts promised by each wooer, were far <lb/>
            beyond what a. mere shepherdess had reason to expect; but, <lb/>
            on the other hand, he reflected t that the maiden was far too <lb/>
            good for common lovers, and that, if ever her real parents <lb/>
            should be discovered, she would be the means of making <lb/>
            them rich for life.</p>
          <p>For these reasons he declined giving a decided answer, <lb/>
            and postponed from time to time, meanwhile, receiving <lb/>
            presents of no small value. Chloe, as soon as she knew of <lb/>
            this, was overwhelmed with grief; but for a considerable <lb/>
            time concealed its cause from Daphnis, for fear of giving <lb/>
            him pain. He, however, was earnest and persevering in <lb/>
            his inquiries as to the subject of her sorrow, and evidently <lb/>
            felt more miserable at having the truth concealed from <lb/>
            him, than he would do if he knew it; accordingly she <lb/>
            acquainted him with every circumstance—with the fact of <lb/>
            the suitors being numerous and wealthy, with Nape's <lb/>
            arguments for immediate marriage, with the hesitation of <lb/>
            Dry as in refusing, and his resolution to postpone matters <lb/>
            until the next vintage-season should begin.</p>
          <p>Daphne almost beside himself at hearing her relation, <lb/>
            sat down and wept bitterly, exclaiming, that, were he de­ <lb/>
            prived of Chloe as a companion in the pastures, it would <lb/>
            prove his death, and not his death only, for that his sheep <note type="footnote"> * See Theocritus. Idyll xxvii. </note><note type="footnote"> + " This is the prettiest low-born lass, that ever <lb/>

             <pb n="320"/>
            would die upon losing such a master. After this burst <lb/>
            of sorrow, recovering himself, he resolved to take courage, <lb/>
            bethought him of endeavouring to persuade Chloo's father <lb/>
            to receive him as her suitor, flattering himself that ho <lb/>
            should be far superior to the others, and would be pre­ <lb/>
            ferred before them. There was one obstacle, which gave <lb/>
            him uneasiness—Lamon was not rich: this reflection <lb/>
            alone rendered his hopes of success slender. Nevertheless <lb/>
            he determined to declare himself a suitor, and Chloe <lb/>
            approved of his design.</p>
          <p>He did not venture to declare his intention to Lamon, <lb/>
            but taking courage, communicated his love to Myrtale, and <lb/>
            spoke also of the marriage ; she imparted everything to her <lb/>
            husband at night. Lamon treated her intercession for <lb/>
            Daphnis very harshly, and rebuked his wife for thinking of <lb/>
            marrying to a mere shepherd's daughter, a youth who by <lb/>
            the tokens found upon him, seemed to give promise of a <lb/>
            much higher fortune, and who, should ho ever find his <lb/>
            relatives, would not only procure the freedom of his foster- <lb/>
            father and mother, but also make them master and mistress <lb/>
            of a much larger estate.</p>
          <p>Myrtale, fearing lest the youth, blighted in his hopes of <lb/>
            marrying Chloe, should make an attempt upon his own life, <lb/>
            gave him a different reason for the opposition on her hus­ <lb/>
            band’s part. “ We are poor, my son, and we require a girl <lb/>
            who will bring a portion with her ; they, on the other hand, <lb/>
            arc rich, and expect rich suitors. However, go and persuade <lb/>
            Chloe, and get her to prevail upon her father, not to look <lb/>
            for too great a match, but to let you take her for a wife. <lb/>
            The girl herself, I am sure, dearly loves you, and would <lb/>
            certainly prefer sharing her bed with a handsome youth, <lb/>
            however poor, than with an ugly ape, however rich."</p>
          <p>Myrtale had no expectation that Dryas, who had so <lb/>
            many richer suitors applying to him, would ever agree to <lb/>
            the wishes of Daphnis, and considered herself to have <lb/>
            offered very plausible arguments for disposing of the subject <lb/>
            of the marriage.</p>
          <p>Daphnis could not in justice find fault with what she <lb/>
            said ; but, as needy lovers generally do, he burst into tears; <lb/>
            and again invoked the assistance of the Nymphs.</p>
          <p>As he slept at night, they again appeared to him in the <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            same dress and form, as they had done before, and the eldest <lb/>
            of them thus addressed him.</p>
          <p>" Chloe's marriage is under the superintendence of ano­ <lb/>
            ther deity : as for yourself we will furnish you with gifts <lb/>
            which shall soften Dryas, and win his consent. The boat <lb/>
            belonging to the young men of Methymna, whose vine­ <lb/>
            branch cable your goats devoured, was that same day carried <lb/>
            far out to sea by the violence of the wind: at night the <lb/>
            gale blowing from the sea, it was driven towards the land <lb/>
            and dashed upon some rocks, there it was wrecked and <lb/>
            everything in it lost. A purse of three thousand drachmas. <lb/>
            was thrown ashore, and lies covered with seaweed near a <lb/>
            dead dolphin, the putrid stench of which is so offensive that <lb/>
            no one will approach it but hastens by as fast as he can. <lb/>
            Go, take this money, and offer it to Dryas. It is enough at <lb/>
            present to make you appear not absolutely poor; the time <lb/>
            will come, when you will bo very rich."</p>
          <p>After speaking to this effect, they disappeared, and with <lb/>
            them the darkness of the night; day dawned, and Daphnis <lb/>
            leaping from his bed with joy, drove his goats to pasture <lb/>
            with boisterous eagerness. After kissing Chloe, and paying <lb/>
            his adorations in the grotto, he went down to the sea, <lb/>
            pretending that it was his intention to bathe, and then <lb/>
            walked along the sands close to the beach, seeking the <lb/>
            three thousand drachmas. The search required little <lb/>
            labour: the dolphin lay rotting in his path, and yielding a <lb/>
            “ most ancient and fish-like smell,” which served to guide <lb/>
            him on his way. He immediately approached it, and upon <lb/>
            removing the weeds found the purse full of silver, which he <lb/>
            put into his scrip ; but before quitting the spot he uttered <lb/>
            blessings upon the Nymphs and upon the ocean likewise ; <lb/>
            for although a shepherd he now thought the sea more de­ <lb/>
            lightful than the land, since it contributed to promote hit <lb/>
            marriage with Chloe.</p>
          <p>Having got possession of this sum, he thought himself <lb/>
            not merely richer than his neighbours, but the richest man <lb/>
            upon the earth, and immediately hastened to Chloe, related <lb/>
            his dream to her, shewed her the purse, and desired her to <lb/>
            tend the herds till he came back: then, hurrying with all <note type="footnote"> * &amp;122 18s. 4d. </note> <note type="footnote"> X </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            speed to Dryas, whom he found with Nape busied in beating <lb/>
            out corn upon the threshing floor, he boldly entered upon <lb/>
            the subject of the marriage.</p>
          <p>" Give me Chloe for a wife. I can play well on the pipe; <lb/>
            I can prune vines; I can plant; I can plough; and I can <lb/>
            winnow. To my skill as a herdsman Chloe can bear wit­ <lb/>
            ness : fifty she-goats were given to my charge, and their <lb/>
            number is now doubled. Formerly we used to send our <lb/>
            females to a neighbour's males; but now I have reared <lb/>
            large and handsome he-goats of our own. I am young; <lb/>
            and, as I have been your neighbour, you know me to have a <lb/>
            blameless character. A goat, moreover, nursed me, as a <lb/>
            ewe did Chloe. Being on so many points superior to other <lb/>
            suitors, you will not find me their inferior in my gifts. <lb/>
            they will offer their goats and their sheep, or a yoke of <lb/>
            mangy oxen, or corn not fit to feed even dunghill fowls ! I <lb/>
            will give you three thousand drachmas!—only let no one <lb/>
            know what I have offered—not even Lamon, my father!" <lb/>
            So saying, he presented the money and threw his arms round <lb/>
            the neck of Dryas.</p>
          <p>Dryas and Nape were surprised at the sight of so much <lb/>
            money, and not only promised to give Chloe in marriage, <lb/>
            but also undertook to procure Lamon's consent to the <lb/>
            match. Nape remained with Daphnis, and drove the oxen <lb/>
            round the floor, while by means of the threshing-machine,* <lb/>
            she separated the grains. Dryas, in the meantime, laid by <lb/>
            the money carefully, in the place where the tokens were <lb/>
            stored up, and hastened to Lamon's house upon the novel <lb/>
            errand of asking† a husband for his daughter. He found <lb/>
            Lamon and Myrtale measuring some barley, which had <lb/>
            been just winnowed, and in very bad spirits at finding it <lb/>
            yield little more than the seed which had been put into the <lb/>
            ground, and endeavoured to console them by saying, that <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τριβόλος</foreign>—a corn-drag, consisting of a thick and ponderous <lb/>

             <pb n="323"/>
            this season the complaint was general. He then asked <lb/>
            Daphnis in marriage for Chloe. " Others," said he, “ would <lb/>
            willingly make me handsome presents, I however will accept <lb/>
            nothing from you, but, on the contrary, will give you of my <lb/>
            own substance. The two young people have been brought <lb/>
            up together, and from feeding their flocks in company they <lb/>
            have contracted a mutual fondness which cannot easily be <lb/>
            dissolved, and they are now of sufficient age to consummate <lb/>
            a marriage.”</p>
          <p>These and many more arguments he urged with all the <lb/>
            eloquence of one who had received three thousand drachmas <lb/>
            for his guerdon. Lamon was no longer able to plead his <lb/>
            poverty, since Dryas entertained no objections upon that <lb/>
            head; nor could he object to the age of Daphnis, for he <lb/>
            was by this time a young man; but even now he did not <lb/>
            explain the real cause of his unwillingness, which was, that <lb/>
            Daphnis was of too good birth for such a match.</p>
          <p>After remaining sometime silent he replied as follows. <lb/>
            “ You act justly, Dryas, in preferring your neighbours before <lb/>
            strangers, and in not thinking wealth superior to honest <lb/>
            poverty. May Pan and the Nymphs reward you with their <lb/>
            friendship for this! I myself am eager for the marriage: I <lb/>
            who am halfway on the road to old age, and begin to feel the <lb/>
            want of assistance on my farm, should indeed be crazy, were <lb/>
            I to refuse a connection with your family; this in itself would <lb/>
            be a great advantage, and Cbloe, too, is most desirable on <lb/>
            account of her beauty, youth, and goodness. At the same <lb/>
            time you must consider that I am only a serf on this estate:. <lb/>
            I am owner of nothing here: it is necessary that my master <lb/>
            should be acquainted with the business, and that we should <lb/>
            have his consent. Suppose, then, that we defer the mar­ <lb/>
            riage till the autumn: persons from the city have informed <lb/>
            me, that he intends coming hither at that time. They shall <lb/>
            then be man and wife ; for the present let them love each <lb/>
            other like brother and sister. I will only farther say, friend <lb/>
            Dryas, that you are seeking as son-in-law one who is supe­ <lb/>
            rior to us all." He added no more, but embraced Dryas, <lb/>
            and handed him some drink, it being mid-day and very hot, <note type="footnote"> * Lamon appears to have been the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτροπος</foreign>, or bailiff upon his <lb/>
            master's estate. </note> <note type="footnote"> x2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            and wishing to shew him every mark of kindness, accom­ <lb/>
            panied him part of his way home.</p>
          <p>The last expression of Lamon was not lost upon Dryas, <lb/>
            but as he went along he thought within himself,—“ Who <lb/>
            can Daphnis be? He was suckled by a she-goat, as if <lb/>
            under the providential care of the deities themselves; he is <lb/>
            very handsome, and bears no resemblance to the flat-nosed <lb/>
            Lamon, or the bald-headed Myrtale; he is master, also, <lb/>
            of three thousand drachmas,—few goatherds can call so <lb/>
            many pears their own! Was he exposed by the same person <lb/>
            who exposed Chloe? Did Lamon find him, as I found <lb/>
            her? were tokens left with him like those which I found? <lb/>
            If, 0 Pan, and ye Nymphs, it be so, whensoever he finds <lb/>
            his own relatives, he may throw some light upon the secret <lb/>
            history of Chloe also !”</p>
          <p>Thus he proceeded, thinking and dreaming, until he <lb/>
            reached the threshing-floor. There he found Daphnis on <lb/>
            the tiptoe of expectation to learn his tidings. Dryas re­ <lb/>
            lieved his mind by addressing him as son-in-law; he pro­ <lb/>
            missed him that the nuptials should take place in the <lb/>
            autumn, and gave him his right hand in confirmation that <lb/>
            Chloe should be the wife of no other.</p>
          <p>Swifter than thought, without stopping to eat or drink, <lb/>
            away ran Daphnis to Chloe. He found her engaged in <lb/>
            milking and making cheese, told her the good news of their <lb/>
            approaching wedding, kissed her openly, as though she were <lb/>
            already his wife, and not by stealth as he used to do, and <lb/>
            began to assist her in her work, by milking the goats and <lb/>
            ewes into the pails, setting the cheeses upon the racks,* <lb/>
            and placing the lambs and kids under their dams. When <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταρσοὶ</foreign>—flat wicker baskets for making and stowing away <lb/>

            their labours were concluded, they washed themselves, ate <lb/>
            and drank, and then went out in search of some ripe fruit. <lb/>
            Of this there was abundance, it being the most fruitful <lb/>
            season of the year. There were pears, both wild and cul­ <lb/>
            tivated, and all sorts of apples, some of which were lying on <lb/>
            the ground, and some still hanging upon the brancnes. <lb/>
            Those upon the ground smelt sweeter; those upon the <lb/>
            boughs were brighter in colour; the former were as fragrant <lb/>
            as new wine, the latter shone like gold. One tree had been <lb/>
            entirely stripped; its branches were bare; it had neither <lb/>
            leaves nor fruit, except a single apple, which grew upon the <lb/>
            top of the highest branch. This apple was very large and <lb/>
            beautiful, and its solitary perfume surpassed the united <lb/>
            fragrance of many others. The gatherer had either been <lb/>
            afraid of climbing to the summit of the tree, or he had <lb/>
            Preserved this beautiful fruit for some love-sick shepherd. <lb/>
            Daphnis, as soon as he espied it, began to climb the tree, <lb/>
            giving no heed to Chloe, who endeavoured to prevent him, <lb/>
            and who finding herself disregarded hurried away pettishly <lb/>
            after her herds. Daphnis climbed the tree, succeeded in <lb/>
            seizing the apple, carried it as a present to Chloe, and <lb/>
            presented it to her, with these words :—" Maiden, this fruit <lb/>
            was produced and cherished by the beauteous hours; the <lb/>
            sun matured it with his beams, and fortune has preserved <lb/>
            it; unless blind, I could not leave it either to fall on the <lb/>
            ground, where cattle, as they grazed, might tread on it, or <lb/>
            where the snake might crawl over it, and defile it with his <lb/>
            slime ; or where time might rot it as it lay; still less could <lb/>
            I do this when it had been seen and praised by you. <lb/>
            Venus received an apple as the prize of beauty; the same <lb/>
            prize I adjudge to you. Paris and I are equally fitted to <lb/>
            be umpires: he was a shepherd, I am a goatherd."</p>
          <p>With these words he placed the apple in her bosom, and <lb/>
            she, upon his drawing near, bestowed on him a kiss; so <lb/>
            that Daphnis did not repent of having ventured to climb* <lb/>
            to such a height; for the kiss which he received was more <lb/>
            precious to him than a golden apple. <note type="footnote"> * “ Is not love a Hercules, <lb/>

          <p>On of Lamon's neighbours, who was a fellow serf <lb/>
            under the same lord, called in his way from Mitylene, and <lb/>
            informed him that their master intended coming just before <lb/>
            the vintage, to see whether the incursion of the Methym­ <lb/>
            næans had done any damage to his lands. The summer <lb/>
            was now closing, and autumn approaching very fast; Lamon, <lb/>
            therefore, immediately began to put the house in such <lb/>
            order as might, in every respect, please his master's eyes. <lb/>
            He cleansed the fountains, that the water might be pure; <lb/>
            carried the manure out of the yard, that the smell might <lb/>
            not be offensive; and trimmed his garden, that all its <lb/>
            beauty might be seen.</p>
          <p>His garden was indeed a beautiful one, and laid out in <lb/>
            a princely style. It was situated on high ground, and was <lb/>
            five hundred feet in length, while in breadth it contained <lb/>
            four acres, so that one might have supposed it an exten­ <lb/>
            sive plain. In it were all kinds of trees,-the apple, the <lb/>
            myrtle, the pear, the pomegranate, the fig, the olive, which <lb/>
            grew here in perfection. On one side of this garden was a <lb/>
            lofty vine, whose branches, laden with blackening grapes, <lb/>
            were suspended above the apple and pear trees, as if vying <lb/>
            with them in the show of fruit. Such were the cultivated <lb/>
            trees. There were also cypresses, laurels, planes, and <lb/>
            pines, over which an ivy instead of a vine stretched out <lb/>
            her branches, with berries in size and colour resembling <lb/>
            grapes.</p>
          <p>The fruit-trees occupied the interior space. Those <lb/>
            which did not bear fruit were ranged on the outside, <lb/>
            serving the purpose of an artificial fence; and the whole <lb/>
            was inclosed by a slight hedge. All were placed in a <lb/>
            strict and regular order,. so that their trunks were <lb/>
            perfectly distinct one from the other, but at a certain <lb/>
            height their branches met, and intermingled their leaves <lb/>
            with a regularity which, though the work of nature, ap­ <lb/>
            peared to be the effect of art. Here were also beds of <note type="footnote"> *..“ . Neo secus omnes in unguem, <lb/>
            Arboribus positis eecto via limite quadret.”—Virg. G. ii. 278. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            various flowers, some of which were cultivated plants, and <lb/>
            some the spontaneous production of the soil. The rose <lb/>
            bushes,* hyacinths, and lilies had been planted by the hand <lb/>
            of man, the violets, the narcissus, and the pimpernel sprang <lb/>
            naturally from the ground. There was shade for summer, <lb/>
            flowers for spring, fruits for autumn, and for all seasons of <lb/>
            the year enjoyment.</p>
          <p>From this garden was to be had a fine view of the plains <lb/>
            with the herds and flocks which grazed upon them ; as well <lb/>
            as of the sea, and of the ships, as they were sailing along, <lb/>
            so that the prospect was no small portion of the beauty of <lb/>
            the place. Exactly in the middle there was a temple and <lb/>
            an altar, dedicated to Bacchus. An ivy encircled the altar, <lb/>
            and a vine extended its branches round the temple; on the <lb/>
            interior the events in the history of the god were repre­ <lb/>
            sented. The delivery of Semele, Ariadne sleeping, Lycurgus <lb/>
            fettered, Pentheus torn in pieces,! the victories over the <lb/>
            Indians, and the metamorphosis of the Tyrrhenian sailors. <lb/>
            On all sides were Satyrs and Bacchantes dancing. Nor <lb/>
            was Pan omitted; he was represented sitting upon a rock, <lb/>
            and playing upon his pipe an air intended equally to regu. <lb/>
            late the motions of the men as they trod the grapes, and of <lb/>
            the women as they danced.</p>
          <p>Such was the garden, which Lamon was busy in get­ <lb/>
            ting into order, cutting away dead wood, and raising <lb/>
            the branches of the vines. He crowned the statue of <lb/>
            Bacchus with flowers, he conducted water from the foun­ <lb/>
            tain discovered by Daphnis, for the flowers, which was used <lb/>
            exclusively for them, and was called Daphnis's Fountain. <lb/>
            Lamon also charged the youth to get his goats into as good <lb/>
            condition as possible, since their master would certainly visit <lb/>
            and examine them after his long absence from the farm. <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch, speaks of the practice of setting off the beauties [we <lb/>
            may also add, the fragrance] of roses and violets, by planting them <lb/>
            side by side with leeks and onions. The originator of this fashion <lb/>
            went upon the principle, no doubt, of <lb/>
            “ Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulcL" </note><note type="footnote"> t ...." .. Oriens tibi victim, adusque <lb/>

            Corpora.”—Ovid. Met. iv. 20, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            Upon this head Daphnis felt confident that he should be <lb/>
            praised; for the herd, which be had received in charge, was <lb/>
            increased twofold: not one of them had been seized by a <lb/>
            wolf, and they were already fatter than sheep. Wishing <lb/>
            to do everything which might render his master favourable <lb/>
            to his marriage, he exerted all his care and activity, driving <lb/>
            them to pasture very early, and returning very late, leading <lb/>
            them to the water twice every day, and choosing for them <lb/>
            the richest pastures. He also took care to provide fresh <lb/>
            bowls,. many new milk-pails, and larger cheese-racks. <lb/>
            Such was his attention to his goats, that he even oiled their <lb/>
            horns, and curried their hair, and they might have been <lb/>
            supposed to be the sacred herd of Pan. Chloe shared in <lb/>
            all his toil, neglecting her own flock, that sho might be of <lb/>
            greater assistance to him, which caused Daphnis to attribute <lb/>
            the beauty of his herd entirely to her.</p>
          <p>While occupied in this manner, a second messenger <lb/>
            came from the city, with orders for them to get in their <lb/>
            vintage as soon as possible; he said he should remain there <lb/>
            until they had made some of the new wine, after which he <lb/>
            should return to Mitylene, and bring their master, at the <lb/>
            end of the vintage season. Lainon and his family received <lb/>
            Eudromus, the runner (for his name was derived from his <lb/>
            employment) with a hearty welcome, and immediately began <lb/>
            to strip the vines, to put the grapes in the vats, and the <lb/>
            must in the casks; reserving some of the finest clusters <lb/>
            with their branches, in order that those also who came out <lb/>
            of the city might form some idea of the vintage, and its <lb/>
            pleasures.</p>
          <p>Before Eudromus departed, Daphnis made him various <lb/>
            presents, and in addition such as are usually given by a <lb/>
            goatherd, such as some well-made cheeses, a young kid, a <lb/>
            white shaggy goat-skin for him to wear when running <lb/>
            on errands in the winter, and many things besides. He <lb/>
            was greatly pleased with Daphnis and embraced him, pro­ <lb/>
            mising to speak favourably of him to his master: with these <figure type="illustration">

              friendly feelings he set out. Daphnis and Chloe were in a <lb/>
              state of great anxiety. She felt no small fear when she <lb/>
              reflected that a youth hitherto accustomed to see only his <lb/>
              goats, the mountains, his fellow-labourers in the fields, and <lb/>
              herself, was for the first time soon to behold his master, whom <lb/>
              he had but recently known even by name. She was anxious <lb/>
              to know how he would conduct himself in the pre­ <lb/>
              sence of his betters; her mind was also filled with agitation <lb/>
              respecting their marriage, fearing lest all their expected <lb/>
              happiness might prove but a dream. Frequently did she <lb/>
              and Daphnis kiss, and frequently did they cling in embraces <lb/>
              as close as though they grew together;. yet their kisses <lb/>
              were alloyed by fear, and their embraces partook of sadness, <lb/>
              as if afraid of the actual presence of their master, or as if <lb/>
              endeavouring to avoid his eyes.</p>
          <p>The following addition to their present troubles likewise <lb/>
            took place.</p>
          <p>There was a certain Lampis, a herdsman of overweening <lb/>
            disposition; he also had been asking Chloe in marriage of <lb/>
            Drvas, and had made many handsome presents to promote <lb/>
            his chance of success. Being well aware, that if the master <lb/>
            of the estate should give his consent, Daphnis would obtain <lb/>
            her for his bride, he resolved to plan some scheme for setting <lb/>
            Lamon's family at variance with their master; and knowing <lb/>
            that the latter was particularly fond of a garden, he deter­ <lb/>
            mined to injure it and destroy its beauty. He was aware <lb/>
            that should he venture to cut down the trees, the noise <lb/>
            would betray him, he determined therefore to vent his rage <lb/>
            against the flowers, so waiting till it was dark, he climbed <lb/>
            over the hedge, and like a wild-boar, rooted up some, <lb/>
            broke others, and trampled upon every flower. Having <lb/>
            done this, he went away unobserved. When Lamon came <lb/>
            the next morning he was about to water his flowers with <lb/>
            the streams which had been conducted from the fountain, <lb/>
            but seeing the whole spot laid waste, and the damage of <lb/>
            such a kind as some determined enemy or spiteful thief <lb/>
            would have committed, he rent his clothes, and called <lb/>
            loudly upon the gods, so that Myrtaie threw down what <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig69.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> " She rose ..... and threw </note><note type="footnote"> Herself upon his breast and there she grew.”—Byron. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="330"/>
              she had in her hands, and ran out; while Daphnis, who was <lb/>
              driving his herds to pasture, hurried back; and when they <lb/>
              saw what had taken place, they uttered a loud shriek, and <lb/>
              burst into tears.</p>
          <p>It was in vain to lament the loss of their flowers, but <lb/>
            they wept from dread of their master's anger; and had any <lb/>
            stranger passed by be would have wept also, for the whole <lb/>
            garden was dismantled: nothing remained but trampled clay. <lb/>
            The few flowers which here and there had escaped destruction <lb/>
            showed by their brilliant hues how beautiful the garden <lb/>
            must have been when in perfection. N umbers of bees rested <lb/>
            upon them, and with incessant buzzing seemed to lament <lb/>
            their fate. Lamon, in his consternation, thus broke forth: <lb/>
            "Alas! for my rose bushes, how are they broken! Alas! <lb/>
            for my violets, how are they trodden under foot! Alas! for <lb/>
            my narcissuses and hyacinths, which some mischievous vil­ <lb/>
            lain has rooted up ! The spring will return, but they will <lb/>
            not put forth their buds! The summer will come, but <lb/>
            they will not be in their full bloom! The autumn will arrive, <lb/>
            but they will crown no one with garlands! And you, my <lb/>
            protector, Bacchus, did not you deign to pity the flowers, <lb/>
            among which you dwell, which daily you behold, and <lb/>
            with which I have so often crowned your brows ? How <lb/>
            can I show this garden to my lord ? When he sees it, what <lb/>
            will be his feelings ? He will hang his old servant, like a <lb/>
            second Marsyas, on one of those pines :-and perhaps he <lb/>
            will hang Daphnis, attributing the destruction of it to his <lb/>
            goats!"</p>
          <p>They ceased weeping for the flowers, and now wept for <lb/>
            themselves. Chloe shed tears at the idea of Daphnis being <lb/>
            hanged, and prayed that their master might never come. <lb/>
            She passed days of wretchedness, fancying she saw Daphnis <lb/>
            already suffering under the scourge.</p>
          <p>Night was approaching when Eudromus returned, and <lb/>
            informed them that their master would be with them in three <lb/>
            days' time, but that his son would arrive next morning. <lb/>
            They now began to deliberate what was to be done respect­ <lb/>
            ing the misfortune which had happened, and took Eudro­ <lb/>
            mus into their councils. Feeling a friendship for Daphnis, <lb/>
            he advised them to relate the whole affair to their young <lb/>
            master on his first arrival; he was his own foster-brother, <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            on which account he had no small interest with him, and <lb/>
            he promised to assist them in the matter.</p>
          <p>On the following day they did as he had recommended. <lb/>
            Astylus came on horseback: a fawning parasite, who always <lb/>
            accompanied him, rode by his side. The former was but be­ <lb/>
            ginning to be bearded, but the chin of Gnatho had long since <lb/>
            felt the razor's edge. Lamon, together with Myrtale and <lb/>
            Daphnis, came out to meet them, and falling at his young <lb/>
            master's feet, besought him to have mercy upon an unfor­ <lb/>
            tunate old man, and to avert his father's anger from one <lb/>
            who was not to blame in any respect; at the same time <lb/>
            relating to him all particulars. A stylus listened with great <lb/>
            commiseration, and when he came to the garden, and saw <lb/>
            the havoc which had been committed, he promised to plead <lb/>
            their excuse with his father by laying the fault on his own <lb/>
            horses, which, he would say, had been tethered there, but <lb/>
            having become restive, had broken loose, and had trampled <lb/>
            down, and destroyed the flowers.</p>
          <p>Lamon and Myrtale invoked upon him every blessing. <lb/>
            Daphnis, moreover, brought him as presents some kids, <lb/>
            some cheese, some birds with their young, some vine- <lb/>
            branches covered with grapes, and some apples still hanging <lb/>
            on their boughs. Among his other gifts he presented some <lb/>
            fragrant Lesbian wine, very choice in flavour.</p>
          <p>Astylus expressed himself pleased with the offerings of <lb/>
            Daphnis, and immediately betook himself to hare hunting, <lb/>
            as was natural in a young man abounding in wealth, nursed <lb/>
            in luxury, and who had come into the country merely for <lb/>
            some change in his amusements.</p>
          <p>Gnatho* being a fellow whose whole science consisted in <lb/>
            eating and drinking to excess, and who was nothing, in fact, <lb/>
            but a compound of gluttony, drunkenness, and sensuality ,t <lb/>
            had narrowly watched Daphnis as he was offering his pre­ <note type="footnote"> * Compare the admirable picture of Gnatho's prototype in the <lb/>

              Bents. He was naturally fond of male beauty, and never <lb/>
              having seen any one so handsome, even in town, he deter­ <lb/>
              mined to make an attempt upon Daphnis, thinking easily to <lb/>
              gain over a mere shepherd youth. Having formed this <lb/>
              determination, instead of going to hunt with Astylus, he <lb/>
              proceeded to the spot where Daphnis was feeding his flock, <lb/>
              under pretence of looking at the goats, but in reality to gaze <lb/>
              upon their master. In order to gain his goodwill, he began <lb/>
              by praising the appearance of the animals, and requested <lb/>
              him to play a pastoral tune upon his pipe, adding, that by <lb/>
              his influence he could soon obtain his freedom. Having in <lb/>
              this manner put him at his ease, he watched his oppor­ <lb/>
              tunity, and when Daphnis was driving home his herd at <lb/>
              night, he ran up and kissed him, and then went on to make <lb/>
              proposals to him.* For some time the youth did not <lb/>
              understand his meaning, but when at last he did, he laid <lb/>
              him prostrate with a blow; for he was in liquor, and hardly <lb/>
              able to stand; and then left him sprawling, in need not of <lb/>
              a boy whose beauty he might admire, but of a man to pick <lb/>
              him up and lead him home. For the time to come Daphnis <lb/>
              would hold no more communication with him, but con­ <lb/>
              stantly changed the place of pasturage for his goats, avoid­ <lb/>
              ing him, but keeping close to Chloe. Nor, to say the <lb/>
              truth, was Gnatho very eager to renew his acquaintance, <lb/>
              having found by personal experience that he was not only <lb/>
              handsome in countenance but stalwart in arm ; nevertheless <lb/>
              lie determined to watch for an opportunity of speaking to <lb/>
              A stylus about him, and flattered himself that he should <lb/>
              easily obtain him as a gift from a young man who was <lb/>
              always ready to give largely, and upon all occasions.</p>
          <p>Just then he could not carry out his plans, for Diony­ <lb/>
            sophanes and Clearista arrived; and no small was the stir <lb/>
            caused by their train of male and female servants, and their <lb/>
            sumpter horses. Dionysophanes was of middle age,t but <lb/>
            tall and handsome; and one who would not suffer by com­ <note type="footnote"> * “ Deinde, ut more caprarum, hircis sui copiam facientium, sibi <lb/>

              parison even with far younger men. In riches he had not <lb/>
              many equals, in virtues he had none. On the first day of <lb/>
              his arrival he sacrificed to the deities who preside over <lb/>
              the country,-to Ceres, to Bacchus, to Pan, and to the <lb/>
              Nymphs, and caused to be prepared one common bowl <lb/>
              for all present.* During the following day he inspected <lb/>
              Lamon's labours, and when he saw the fields well ploughed, <lb/>
              the flourishing condition of the vines, and the beauty of the <lb/>
              garden (for Astylus had taken the blame about the flowers <lb/>
              on himself), he was very much delighted, praised Lamon <lb/>
              highly, and promised to give him his freedom. After going <lb/>
              over the farm, he went to see the herds, and him who tended <lb/>
              them.</p>
          <p>Chloe fled to the woods: she was ashamed and frightened <lb/>
            at the thought of appearing before so many strangers. <lb/>
            Daphnis, however, stood still: he had on a shaggy goat- <lb/>
            skin, a new scrip was suspended from his shoulder; in one <lb/>
            band he held some fresh cheeses, and with the other, two <lb/>
            sucking kids. If ever Apollo tended the herds of Laomedon, <lb/>
            his appearance must have been like that of Daphnis now. <lb/>
            He did not say a word, but covered with blushes, hung <lb/>
            down his head, and presented his offerings.</p>
          <p>" This, Master (said Lamon), is the young man who has <lb/>
            taken care of your goats. Fifty female, and two male goats <lb/>
            were the number which I received from you: this youth has <lb/>
            increased the former to a hundred, and the latter to ten. <lb/>
            Observe how sound are their horns, how fat and long-haired <lb/>
            they are in body. He has even made them musical; for <lb/>
            all their movements are regulated by the pipe."</p>
          <p>Clearista, who was present, and heard what was said, <lb/>
            expressed a wish to see a proof of what he asserted, and <lb/>
            desired Daphnis to pipe to his goats in his usual manner, <lb/>
            promising him for his pains a tunic, a cloak, and a pair of <lb/>
            sandals. Daphnis disposed the company in a semi-circle; <lb/>
            then standing under the shade of a beech-tree, he took his <lb/>
            pipe from his scrip, and breathed into it very gently. The <lb/>
            goats stood still, merely lifting up their heads. Next he <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρητη̃ρας στήσασθαι</foreign>. To set up bowls an a sign of feasting.—See <lb/>

            played the pasture-tune,. upon which they all put down <lb/>
            their heads, and began to graze. Now he produced some <lb/>
            notes, soft and sweet in tone:—at once all his herd lay down. <lb/>
            After this he piped in a sharp key, and they ran off to the <lb/>
            wood, as if a wolf were in sight. Within a short interval ho <lb/>
            played the recall, and immediately issuing from their covert, <lb/>
            they ran to his very feet. Few domestic servants will be seen <lb/>
            to obey their master so readily: all the company were aston­ <lb/>
            ished at his skill, but more particularly Clearista, who <lb/>
            reiterated her promise of giving a reward to the handsome <lb/>
            goatherd, who had shown such skill in music. The party, <lb/>
            returning to the farm, went to dinner, and sent Daphnis a <lb/>
            portion from their own table.</p>
          <p>Daphnis shared the dainties with Chloe, and was delighted <lb/>
            with the flavour of city cookery, and felt very sanguine of <lb/>
            obtaining his master's consent and so of succeeding in his <lb/>
            marriage.</p>
          <p>Gnatho, still more captivated by this display of Daphnis's <lb/>
            skill, and reckless of life unless he could effect his purpose, <lb/>
            watched for Astylus as he was walking in the garden, and <lb/>
            leading him to the temple of Bacchus, began to kiss his <lb/>
            feet and hands.</p>
          <p>Upon Astylus inquiring why he did this, urging him to <lb/>
            speak out, and promising to grant his request, he replied, " It <lb/>
            is all over with your old friend Gnatho; I who once cared <lb/>
            only for the table; I who used to swear that nothing was <lb/>
            better than generous old wine, and that your city cooks <lb/>
            were better than all the comely youths of Mitylene,—now <lb/>
            can find nothing handsome excepting Daphnis. I no longer <lb/>
            relish, nor even taste the choice dishes which are daily <lb/>
            prepared in such abundance, flesh, fish, and pastry; but <lb/>
            would willingly be transformed into a goat and browse on <lb/>
            grass and leaves, if only I could listen to the pipe of Daph­ <lb/>
            nis, and be under his charge. Shew yourself then, my . <lb/>
            preserver, and enable me to triumph in my suit; if you <lb/>
            refuse, I swear by Bacchus, that I will seize a dagger, and <lb/>
            after eating until I can eat no longer, will stab myself <lb/>
            before the door of Daphnis, and then you will no longer be <lb/>
            able to call me your sweet Gnatty,t as you are used to <figure type="illustration">

              to do." The good-natured young man, who was no stranger <lb/>
              to the power of love, moved by his blandishments and <lb/>
              tears, promised to ask Daphnis of his father, under pretence <lb/>
              of requiring him for a slave, but in reality to be the favourite <lb/>
              of Gnatho. Then wishing to put him in good spirits he <lb/>
              jokingly asked whether he was not ashamed of taking a fancy <lb/>
              to a son of Lamon, a common goatherd; at the same time <lb/>
              mimicking a feeling of disgust at rank and goatish smells.</p>
          <p>Gnatho, who was well schooled in the love-tales of my­ <lb/>
            thology, which he had heard at the tables of luxurious <lb/>
            profligates, began to discourse very learnedly of the matters <lb/>
            relating to himself and Daphnis.—" Lovers, my master, are <lb/>
            not over nice; wheresoever they see beauty, they own its <lb/>
            influence and succumb to it; some have fallen in love with a <lb/>
            tree, some with a river, others with a wild beast,-now who <lb/>
            would not commiserate a lover who stood in dread of the <lb/>
            object of his love ? I, however, am captivated by one who <lb/>
            though a slave in his condition, is worthy of being a freeman <lb/>
            as regards his beauty.</p>
          <p>"His hair* is like the hyacinth, and his eyes sparkle under <lb/>
            his eye brows like gems set in a golden ring, his face is <lb/>
            suffused with a rosy hue of health, his mouth displays teeth <lb/>
            as white as ivory. Who would not wish to snatch a kiss <lb/>
            from such a mouth ? In taking a fancy to a shepherd I do but <lb/>

            Ganymede was a shepherd and was snatched away by Jupi­ <lb/>

            obey him as though they were in love with him; and let us <lb/>
            be thankful to the eagles for leaving such an impersonation <lb/>
            of beauty upon earth." Astylus laughed heartily at hearing <lb/>
            him talk thus, and saying that love made folks great orators, <lb/>
            promised to take an opportunity of mentioning the subject <lb/>
            of Daphnis to his father. Eudromus overheard their con­ <lb/>
            versation, and immediately gave information of it to <lb/>
            Daphnis and Lamon. He loved the young man because of <lb/>
            his amiable disposition, and could not bear to think that so <lb/>
            much beauty and worth should be subjected to Gnatho's <lb/>
            drunken humours. Daphnis in his alarm determined either <lb/>
            to fly from the country, taking Chloe with him, or to destroy <lb/>
            himself and Chloe at the same time.</p>
          <p>Lamon upon his part called Myrtale out of the house, and <lb/>
            exclaimed, " 0 my dear wife, we are undone. It is time <lb/>
            for us to discover what we have so long concealed. Our <lb/>
            goats and all belonging to us will it is true now be deserted; <lb/>
            but I swear by Pan, and the Nymphs, that even supposing <lb/>
            I am myself to be left like an old ox in the stall (as the <lb/>
            saying is), I will no longer keep the history of Daphnis a <lb/>
            secret. I will tell how and where I found him exposed, I <lb/>
            will explain how he was nursed, and will shew the tokens, <lb/>
            which were placed with him. That rascally Gnatho shall <lb/>
            know, to what manner of youth he, vile as he is, has taken a <lb/>
            liking!-Take care to have everything in readiness! "</p>
          <p>Having formed this resolution, they went into the house <lb/>
            again. Astylus, in the mean time, proceeding to his father, <lb/>
            when he happened to be disengaged, begged his permission <lb/>
            to take Daphnis home with them on their return, alleging, <lb/>
            that so beautiful a youth was too good for his present rustic <lb/>
            situation, and would very soon under Gnatho's care acquire <lb/>
            the polish of city manners. His father willingly complied <lb/>
            with his request, and sending for Lamon and Myrtale, com­ <lb/>
            municated to them as good news, that Daphnis would <lb/>
            henceforth wait upon Astylus instead of tending goats, at <lb/>
            the same time promising them two goatherds to supply his <lb/>
            place. It was then, as the attendants were crowding round, <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            and rejoicing to hear that they were to have among them so <lb/>
            handsome a fellow-slave, that Lamon, having requested <lb/>
            leave to speak, thus addressed his master. "Be pleased, <lb/>
            master, to listen to an old man and hear the truth. I swear <lb/>
            by Pan and the Nymphs, that I will not utter anything <lb/>
            which is false.—I am not the father of Daphnis, nor was <lb/>
            Myrtale so fortunate as to be his mother. The parents <lb/>
            of this youth, whoever they were, exposed him in his <lb/>
            infancy; perhaps, because, they bad already more children <lb/>
            than they knew how to maintain. I found him lying on <lb/>
            the earth, and one of my she-goats nursing him. When <lb/>
            she died, I buried her in the border of my garden, feeling <lb/>
            a regard for her, inasmuch as she had done a mother's duty. <lb/>
            I confess having found various tokens with the infant, <lb/>
            which I still preserve; for they prove him to be born to a <lb/>
            higher station than that which he now fills with me. I am <lb/>
            not so high-minded as to slight the offer of his being an <lb/>
            attendant on Astylus—an excellent servant to a virtuous <lb/>
            and excellent master: but I cannot bear the idea of his <lb/>
            being a sport for the drunken hours of Gnatho, who would <lb/>
            fain take him to Mitylene, that he may be abused."</p>
          <p>Lamon at the conclusion of this speech burst into tears. <lb/>
            Gnatho began to bluster, and threatened to strike him, but <lb/>
            Dionysophanes sternly frowning, ordered him to be silent; <lb/>
            and again interrogating Lamon, urged him to tell the <lb/>
            truth, and not to invent a tale merely to keep his son <lb/>
            at home.—When Lamon continued unshaken in his asser­ <lb/>
            tions, called upon the gods to be his witnesses, and pro­ <lb/>
            fessed his readiness to submit to torture, should be be <lb/>
            uttering a falsehood; his master, in the presence of Clea­ <lb/>
            rista, who sat by him, began to test the probability of the <lb/>
            tale, as follows. " What motive can Lamon have to tell <lb/>
            a falsehood, when two goatherds are offered him in lieu of <lb/>
            one? How could a plain rustic possibly invent such a <lb/>
            tale ?—Besides, is it not altogether unlikely that such an <lb/>
            old man and such a plain old woman can be the parents of <lb/>
            so handsome a son."</p>
          <p>He determined to rest no longer upon mere conjectures, <lb/>
            but to examine the tokens, and to see whether they bespoke <lb/>
            an illustrious birth. Myrtale had gone to fetch them, for <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            they were preserved in an old bag. Dionysophanes was the <lb/>
            first to examine them, and when he beheld the purple mantle, <lb/>
            the golden clasp, and little sword with the ivory hilt, he <lb/>
            exclaimed, Lord Jupiter! and called to Clearista to come <lb/>
            and look at them.- When Clearista beheld them, she <lb/>
            uttered a loud shriek, and cried out, " Ye friendly Fates, <lb/>
            are not these the very things, which we exposed with our <lb/>
            little one, when we sent Sophrosyne to leave him in this <lb/>
            part of the country! they are none other, they are the very <lb/>
            same, my husband! the child is ours. Daphnis is your son, <lb/>
            and he has been tending his own father's flock."</p>
          <p>Before she had done speaking, and while Dionysophanes <lb/>
            was kissing the tokens and shedding tears of joy, Asty­ <lb/>
            lus, who now understood that Daphnis was his brother, <lb/>
            threw off his cloak, and ran through the garden to give him <lb/>
            the first salute. When Daphnis saw Astylus running <lb/>
            towards him, followed by many others, and heard them <lb/>
            calling out his own name, he thought they were coming to <lb/>
            seize him and carry him off by violence. Accordingly he <lb/>
            threw down his scrip, and his pipe, and ran towards the <lb/>
            sea with the determined resolution to throw himself into it <lb/>
            from the top of a high rock: and perhaps (strange to say!) <lb/>
            his being found would have proved the occasion of his being <lb/>
            lost for ever, had not Astylus perceiving the occasion of <lb/>
            his alarm, called out, " Stop, stop, Daphnis, I am your <lb/>
            brother: and they, who have hitherto been your masters, <lb/>
            are now your parents. Lamon has just now given us tho <lb/>
            whole account of the she-goat, and has shewn us the tokens, <lb/>
            which were found with you! look back! see! with what <lb/>
            cheerful and smiling faces they are coming towards you! <lb/>
            Brother, let me have the first kiss. I swear by the Nymphs, <lb/>
            I am not deceiving you."</p>
          <p>Not without hesitation was Daphnis induced after this <lb/>
            solemn assertion to pause, and wait for Astylus, whom he <lb/>
            received with a kiss. While they were embracing, his <lb/>
            father and mother with Lamon and Myrtale and all the men <lb/>
            and maid servants came thronging up, threw their arms <lb/>
            round him, and kissed him with tears of joy. Daphnis <lb/>
            affectionately saluted his father and mother before the rest, <lb/>
            and as though he had long known them, clasped them to <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            his breast, and would not disengage himself from their <lb/>
            embrace: — so soon does natural affection assert her <lb/>
            rights.</p>
          <p>For a time even Chloe was almost forgotten. After <lb/>
            returning to the farm, and putting on a costly dress, ho <lb/>
            fiat down by his real father, who spoke to the following <lb/>
            effect.</p>
          <p>" My children, I married when very young; and in a short <lb/>
            space of time became as I considered myself a very fortunate <lb/>
            father. First a son was born to me, next a daughter, <lb/>
            and then you, my Astylus. I thought my family now large <lb/>
            enough, for which reason I exposed Daphnis, the boy who <lb/>
            was born in addition to the others, placing with him these <lb/>
            ornaments, not as tokens, but to serve as funeral weeds.- <lb/>
            Fortune had different plans in view.—My eldest son and <lb/>
            daughter died of the same disease in one day: but the pro­ <lb/>
            vidence of the gods has preserved you, Daphnis, that we <lb/>
            might have an additional stay in our old age.—Do not bear <lb/>
            ill will towards me, from the remembrance of my having <lb/>
            exposed you; for I did not do so with a willing mind, nor <lb/>
            do you, Astylus, feel grieved that you will now have a part <lb/>
            only, instead of the whole of my estate; for to a wise man <lb/>
            no wealth is more valuable than a brother. Love each <lb/>
            other;—and as for wealth you shall be able to vie even with <lb/>
            princes. I shall leave to you extensive lands, a number of <lb/>
            dexterous servants, stores of gold and silver, and whatever <lb/>
            else forms the possession of the prosperous. Only this par­ <lb/>
            ticular estate I reserve for Daphnis, with Lamon and Myr­ <lb/>
            tale, and the goats which he himself has tended."</p>
          <p>Before he had finished speaking, Daphnis sprang from his <lb/>
            seat, and said, " Father, you very seasonably remind me of <lb/>
            these matters. I will go and lead my goats to water, they <lb/>
            must now be thirsty, and are no doubt waiting to hear my <lb/>
            pipe, while I am sitting here. Every one laughed at hearing <lb/>
            the master so willing to be still the goatherd. One of the <lb/>
            servants was sent in place of Daphnis to tend the herd; <lb/>
            while he and the rest of the company, often sacrificing to <lb/>
            JOVE THE PRESERVER, sat down together to a banquet <lb/>
            Gnatho was the only one who did not come to the enter­ <lb/>
            tainment; for being under great alarm, he remained all day <lb/>
            and night in the temple of Bacchus, as a suppliant. <note type="footnote">z 2 </note> <pb n="340"/>
            </p>
          <p>The report that Dionysophanes had found his son, <lb/>
            and that Daphnis the goatherd was now master of the <lb/>
            estate, having soon spread abroad, early the next morning <lb/>
            numbers flocked to the cottage from various parts with <lb/>
            congratulations to the youth and gifts to the father.— <lb/>
            Dryas the foster-father of Chloe was among the first who <lb/>
            arrived.</p>
          <p>Dionysophanes kept them all, after sharing of his joy, <lb/>
            to partake of an entertainment. Store of wine was pro­ <lb/>
            vided, abundance of wheaten bread, wild fowl, sucking pigs, <lb/>
            and sweets of various kinds, and many victims were sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed to the country's deities. Daphnis collected all his <lb/>
            pastoral equipments, and distributed them in separate offer­ <lb/>
            ings to the gods. To Bacchus he presented his scrip, and <lb/>
            coat of skin. To Pan his pipe and transverse-flute. To the <lb/>
            Nymphs his crook, and the milkpails, which he had made <lb/>
            with his own hands. The happiness arising from our <lb/>
            wonted condition is however so much greater than that <lb/>
            which springs from unexpected good fortune, that he could <lb/>
            not refrain from tears when parting with each offering. He <lb/>
            could not suspend his milkpails in the grotto without once <lb/>
            more milking into them : nor his coat of skin without once <lb/>
            more putting it on: nor his pipe without once more play­ <lb/>
            ing on it. He kissed each of them in turn ; he talked to his <lb/>
            goats and called them by their names; he drank from the <lb/>
            fountain because he had so often done so in company with <lb/>
            Chloe.—Still he did not yet venture to declare his love, but <lb/>
            waited for a favourable opportunity.</p>
          <p>While Daphnis was engaged in these religious ceremonies, <lb/>
            the following circumstances befel Chloe. She was sitting <lb/>
            weeping and watching her flock, and exclaiming (as was <lb/>
            natural) "Daphnis has forgotten me. He is dreaming of <lb/>
            some wealthy match. To what purpose did I make him <lb/>
            swear by his goats instead of by the Nymphs ? he has de­ <lb/>
            serted the former as well as me ; nor even when sacrificing <lb/>
            to the Nymphs and to Pan, has he had any desire to see his <lb/>
            Cbloe. Perhaps among his mother's waiting women, he has <lb/>
            seen some girl preferable to me. May he be happy I As <lb/>
            for me I shall not survive it.</p>
          <p>While she was giving utterance to these thoughts, Lam pis <lb/>
            the herdsman with a band of rustics suddenly came up and <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            seized her. He conceived that Daphnis would no longer <lb/>
            marry her, and that Dryas would be well content to have <lb/>
            him as a son-in-law. While she was being borne off with <lb/>
            tears and shrieks, some one who had witnessed the trans­ <lb/>
            action, hastened to inform Nape: Nape informed Dryas, <lb/>
            and Dryas communicated it to Daphnis. Distracted at the <lb/>
            intelligence, afraid to explain the circumstance to his father, <lb/>
            and unable to restrain his own emotions, he betook himself <lb/>
            to the outer garden-walk and there vented his grief:­</p>
          <p>" What an unhappy discovery of parentage, is mine! how <lb/>
            much better would it have been for me still to tend my <lb/>
            herds! How much happier was I, when a slave! then I <lb/>
            could behold my Chloe!—but now, Lampis has carried <lb/>
            her away; this very night, perhaps, she will be his wife! <lb/>
            In the mean time I am here, drinking and feasting, and <lb/>
            have to no purpose sworn by Pan, by my goats, and by the <lb/>
            Nymphs."</p>
          <p>These words were overheard by Gnatho, who was lurking <lb/>
            in the garden; he considered it a good opportunity for <lb/>
            effecting a reconciliation with Daphnis. Assembling some <lb/>
            youths, who waited upon A stylus, he pursued Dryas, whom <lb/>
            he desired to conduct them to the place where Lampis dwelt. <lb/>
            They overtook him just as he was dragging Chloe into his <lb/>
            house, rescued her from him, and gave the country-fellows, <lb/>
            his companions, a sound drubbing. He was very desirous <lb/>
            also to seize and bind Lampis, and bring him back like a <lb/>
            prisoner of war, but the fellow was too much for him and <lb/>
            ran away.</p>
          <p>Having accomplished this exploit, he returned just as night <lb/>
            was coming on. Dionysophanes had already retired to <lb/>
            rest; but finding Daphnis still up and weeping in the garden, <lb/>
            presented Chloe to him, and gave him an account of the <lb/>
            whole adventure, beseeching him to bear no ill-will, but to <lb/>
            retain him in his service, in which he would prove himself <lb/>
            of use, and not to banish him from his father's table, which <lb/>
            would deprive him of his bread. When Daphnis saw Chloe, <lb/>
            and once more had her in his possession, he forgave Gnatho, <lb/>
            because of his good deed, and began to apologize to the <lb/>
            maiden for his neglect.</p>
          <p>Upon holding a consultation, Daphnis at first resolved to <lb/>
            marry Chloe privately, and to keep her in concealment, <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            making no one but her own mother acquainted with the <lb/>
            matter; Dryas would not concur in this plan, he was for <lb/>
            communicating every thing to Daphnis's father, and himself <lb/>
            undertook the task of obtaining his consent. Accordingly, <lb/>
            taking the token with him in his scrip, he went the next day <lb/>
            to Dionysophanes and Clearista, who were sitting in the <lb/>
            garden, in company with Astylus and Daphnis; silence <lb/>
            ensued upon his appearance, when he addressed them <lb/>
            thus :­</p>
          <p>" The same necessity, which influenced Lamon, now urges <lb/>
            me to publish circumstances, which hitherto have remained <lb/>
            secret. I am not Chloe's father; nor was she in the first <lb/>
            instance brought up by me. Other persons were her parents, <lb/>
            and when lying in the grotto of the Nymphs, a ewe became <lb/>
            her nurse. I saw this myself, to my astonishment, and <lb/>
            under the power of this feeling, I adopted her. Her beauty <lb/>
            confirms what I say ; for she does not resemble either me or <lb/>
            my wife. These tokens, which I likewise found with her, <lb/>
            prove the truth of my assertion, for they are too valuable to <lb/>
            belong to any shepherd. Examine them, endeavour to find <lb/>
            out the maiden's relatives, and perhaps she will prove worthy <lb/>
            of your son."</p>
          <p>This last expression was not thrown out undesignedly by <lb/>
            Dryas: nor was it heard heedlessly by Dionysophanes, who <lb/>
            turning his eyes upon Daphnis, and observing him turn pale, <lb/>
            while a tear stole down his cheeks, easily discovered the <lb/>
            youth's love. Moved more by regard for his own child than <lb/>
            by any concern for the unknown maiden, he weighed the <lb/>
            words of Dryas with great attention. After viewing the <lb/>
            tokens produced before him, tho gilt sandals, the anklets, <lb/>
            and the head-dress, he called Chloe to him, and bid her take <lb/>
            courage, for she had already got a husband, and most probably <lb/>
            would soon discover her real father and mother. Clearista <lb/>
            now took her, and dressed her as became the intended wife <lb/>
            of her son. Dionysophanes, in the mean time, retired apart <lb/>
            with Daphnis, and inquired whether she was still a virgin; <lb/>
            and upon his declaring that nothing had passed between <lb/>
            them, beyond kisses and vows: pleased with their mutual <lb/>
            oaths of fidelity, he made them join the banquet.</p>
          <p>Now might it be seen what beauty is when set off by the <lb/>
            accessories of ornament. Chloe when richly dressed, with <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            her hair braided, and her face resplendent from the bath, <lb/>
            appeared to all so much more beautiful than before, that <lb/>
            Daphnis himself could hardly recognize her. Any spec­ <lb/>
            tator, even without knowing anything about the tokens, <lb/>
            would have sworn that Dryas could not be the father of so <lb/>
            fair a maiden. Nevertheless he was invited to the feast, <lb/>
            where he and Nape, with Lamon and Myrtale for their <lb/>
            companions, reclined on a separate couch.</p>
          <p>On the following day victims were again sacrificed to tho <lb/>
            gods; bowls were prepared, and Chloe suspended her pas­ <lb/>
            toral equipments-her pipe, her scrip, her cloak of goat in, <lb/>
            and her milkpails. She also mingled wine with the waters <lb/>
            of the fountain in the grotto, because she had been suckled <lb/>
            near it, and had so often bathed there, then she crowned <lb/>
            with flowers the ewe's grave, which Dryas pointed out to her. <lb/>
            She, too, piped once more to her flock, and having done so, <lb/>
            prayed the Nymphs that her parents might prove worthy <lb/>
            of the union of Daphnis and herself.</p>
          <p>When the party had had enough of their rural festivities, <lb/>
            they determined upon returning to the city, in order to try <lb/>
            and discover Chloe's parents, and no longer to defer the <lb/>
            marriage. By break of day the next morning they were <lb/>
            prepared for their journey. Before their departure they <lb/>
            made Dryas a present of another three thousand drachmas; <lb/>
            with liberty to reap half the corn, and gather half the grapes <lb/>
            annually for his own use ; they likewise gave him the goats, <lb/>
            goatherds, four yoke of oxen, and some winter garments; <lb/>
            his wife also was presented with her freedom.</p>
          <p>After this they took the road to Mitylene, travelling in <lb/>
            grand style with horses and carriages. They arrived at the <lb/>
            city by night, and so for the time escaped the notice of tho <lb/>
            citizens; but early the next day the doors were surrounded <lb/>
            by multitudes of men and women. The men congratulated <lb/>
            Dionysophanes on having found his son, the more particularly <lb/>
            when they saw his beauty. The women gave Clearista joy <lb/>
            at bringing with her not only her son, but likewise an <lb/>
            intended bride. Chloe excited the admiration even of the <lb/>
            women, displaying as she did, charms which could not be <lb/>
            surpassed. The whole city was in a bustle on account of <lb/>
            the youth and the maiden, predicting already that the mar­ <lb/>
            riage would be a happy one, and wishing that the parents <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            of the maiden might prove to be of a rank worthy of her <lb/>
            beauty. Many of the richest ladies prayed the gods that <lb/>
            they might be reputed to be the mothers of so much love­ <lb/>
            liness.</p>
          <p>Dionysophanes, fatigued with excess of anxious thought, <lb/>
            fell into a deep sleep, during which he saw the following <lb/>
            vision. The Nymphs appeared to be requesting the god <lb/>
            of love at length to grant them his consent to the cele­ <lb/>
            bration of the marriage. Slackening the string of his bow, <lb/>
            and placing it by the side of his quiver, he addressed Diony­ <lb/>
            sophanes, bidding him to invite those of highest rank of <lb/>
            Mitylene to a banquet, and when he had filled the last <lb/>
            goblet, to exhibit the tokens before each of them, and then <lb/>
            to commence the hymeneal song. After what he had seen <lb/>
            and heard, Dionysophanes arose in the morning, and ordered <lb/>
            a magnificent feast to be prepared, in which all the delicacies <lb/>
            which the sea, the earth, the lakes, and even the rivers could <lb/>
            produce, were to be collected together. All the chiefs of <lb/>
            Mitylene were his guests. When night was come, and when <lb/>
            the goblet was filled from which to pour out the libation* <lb/>
            to Mercury, a slave brought forward the ornaments in a <lb/>
            silver vase, and holding them in his right hand carried them <lb/>
            round, and displayed them to all the visitors. No one <lb/>
            acknowledged them, till Megacles, who, on account of his <lb/>
            age, was honoured with the highest couch, recognising <lb/>
            them, cried out with a loud and animated voice,-,, What <lb/>
            do I see! what has been the fate of my daughter! is she <lb/>
            indeed alive ? or did some shepherd find these things, and <lb/>
            carry them away. Tell me, I pray, Dionysophanes, where <lb/>
            did you meet with these tokens of my child ? Now that <lb/>
            you have found your son, do not enviously begrudge me the <lb/>
            discovery of my daughter."</p>
          <p>Dionysophanes requested him first of all to give them an <lb/>
            account of the exposure of his daughter; and Megacles in <lb/>
            the same loud and earnest tone replied,—" Formerly my <lb/>
            income was very narrow, for I had expended my fortune in <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig73.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="345"/>
              equipping choruses and fitting out galleys.* While myaffairs <lb/>
              were in this condition I bad a daughter born. Loath to bring <lb/>
              her up to the miseries; of poverty, and knowing that there <lb/>
              are many who are willing to become even reputed parents,! <lb/>
              I dressed her in these very tokens, and exposed her. She <lb/>
              was laid in the grotto of the Nymphs, and committed to <lb/>
              their protection. Since that time wealth began to pour in <lb/>
              upon me every day, when I had no heir to enjoy it, for 1 <lb/>
              was never so fortunate as to become the father even of <lb/>
              another daughter; but, as if wishing to make a mock of <lb/>
              me, the gods are continually sending dreams by night, <lb/>
              signifying, forsooth, that a ewe will make me father."</p>
          <p>Upon this Dionysophanes called out in a yet louder tone <lb/>
            than Megacles, and springing from his couch led in Chloe <lb/>
            sumptuously dressed, exclaiming,—" This is the child whom <lb/>
            you exposed. This maiden, through the providence of the <lb/>
            gods, was suckled by a sheep, and preserved for you; as <lb/>
            Daphnis was reared by a goat, and saved for me. Take the <lb/>
            tokens, and your daughter; take her, and bestow her as a <lb/>
            bride on Daphnis. Both were exposed; both have been <lb/>
            again found by us, their parents; both have been under <lb/>
            the peculiar care of Pan, of the Nymphs, and of the God <lb/>
            of Love."</p>
          <p>Megacles at once assented, clasped Chloe to his bosom, <lb/>
            and sent for his wife Rhode. They slept at the house that <lb/>
            night, for Daphnis had sworn by the gods that he would <lb/>
            not part with Chloe even to her own father.</p>
          <p>The next morning they all agreed to return to the country: <lb/>
            this was done at the entreaty of Daphnis and Chloe, who <lb/>
            were weary of their sojourn in the city; and had formed a <lb/>
            scheme for celebrating their nuptials in a pastoral manner.</p>
          <p>Upon their arrival at Lamon's cottage, they introduced <lb/>
            Dryas to Megacles, and Nape was made known to Rhode, <lb/>
            after which the preparations were made for the festival on <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εις χορηγίας</foreign>, cal <foreign xml:lang="grc">τριραρχίας έξεδαπάνησα</foreign>. The business of <lb/>
            the Choregus, or chorus master, was to defray the expenses of the <lb/>
            scenical representations, and those of the solemn festivals; the <lb/>
            Trierarch had to fit out a ship of war, the state providing only the vessel <lb/>
            and the crew. Both offices involved of course very heavy expenses. </note><note type="footnote"> t ..." ..Stat Fortuna improba noctu, <lb/>

             <pb n="346"/>
            a splendid scale. Chloe was devoted to the guardianship <lb/>
            of the Nymphs by her father. He suspended the tokens, <lb/>
            among various other things, as offerings to them; and <lb/>
            increased the six thousand drachmas, which Dry as now <lb/>
            possessed, to ten thousand.</p>
          <p>As the day was very fine, Dionysophanes caused couches <lb/>
            of green leaves to be spread inside the grotto, and all tho <lb/>
            villagers were invited and sumptuously regaled. There <lb/>
            were present Lam on and Myrtale, Dryas and Nape, Dorco's <lb/>
            kinsmen, and Philetas with his sons Chromis and Lycæ­ <lb/>
            nium ; even Lampis, who had been forgiven, was among the <lb/>
            guests. All the amusements were, of course, as among <lb/>
            such merrymakers. of a rustic and pastoral kind. Reaping- <lb/>
            songs were sung; and the jokes of the vintage-season were <lb/>
            repeated. Philetas played on the pipe, and Lampis on the <lb/>
            flute, while Lamon and Dryas danced. Chloe and Daphnis <lb/>
            passed the time in kissing. The goats came and grazed <lb/>
            near them, as if they also were partakers of the festival. <lb/>
            This was not very agreeable to the dainty city folks; <lb/>
            Daphnis, however, called several of them by name, gave <lb/>
            them some leaves, which they eat out of his hand, while he <lb/>
            held them by the horns, and kissed them.</p>
          <p>Not only now, but during the remainder of their days, <lb/>
            Daphnis and Chloe led a pastoral life, worshipping as their <lb/>
            deities the Nymphs, Pan, and the God of Love. Their <lb/>
            flocks of goats and sheep were numerous, and their favourite <lb/>
            food consisted of the fruits of autumn, and milk. They <lb/>
            bad their first-born, a boy, suckled by a goat; their second, <lb/>
            a girl, was brought up by a ewe; the former was named <lb/>
            Philopœmen,* the latter Agele.† In this manner of life, <lb/>
            and in this spot, they lived to a good old age. They <lb/>
            adorned the grotto of the Nymphs; erected statues; raised <lb/>
            an altar to Cupid the Shepherd; and instead of a pine <lb/>
            reared a ternple for the habitation of Pan, and dedicated it to <lb/>
            Pan the Warrior; these names, however, were given, and <lb/>
            these things done, in after years. At the time we are <lb/>
            now speaking of, when night arrived, all the guests con­ <lb/>
            ducted them to the bridal chamber, some playing on the <lb/>
            pipe, some on the flute, some holding large torches; and <lb/>
            upon arriving at the door, they raised their voices in harsh <note type="footnote"> * A lover of the flock. </note> <note type="footnote"> t A lover of the herd. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="347"/>
            and rugged tones, which Bounded more like a concert of fel­ <lb/>
            lows breaking up the ground with mattocks than a chorus of <lb/>
            human beings singing the nuptial hymn.* Daphnis and <lb/>
            Chloe, on their part, went to bed in nature's own adorn­ <lb/>
            ment, where they kissed and embraced each other, and <lb/>
            were as wakeful as the very owls. Daphnis carried into <lb/>
            practice the instructions of his preceptress Lycænium, and <lb/>
            Chloe learnt, for the first time in her life, that all their <lb/>
            doings in the woods had been but so much child's play. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>SIDON is situated upon the coast of the Assyrian sea ; it <lb/>
            is the mother- city of the Phœnicians, and its inhabitants <lb/>
            were the founders of Thebes. It has a harbour of capacious <lb/>
            extent, which gradually admits within it the waters of the <lb/>
            sea; it is double, because, to the right, a passage has been <lb/>
            dug into an inner basin, which likewise admits the sea; in <lb/>
            this manner the first harbour becomes the entrance to a <lb/>
            second, which affords a secure haven to vessels during sum­ <lb/>
            mer, while in winter they can ride at anchor safely in the <lb/>
            former. Upon arriving here after encountering a severe <lb/>
            storm, I made thank-offerings† on account of my preserva­ <lb/>
            tion, to the goddess of the Phœnicians, called by the Sido­ <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μήτηρ φοινίκων ὴ πόλις. θηζαιων ό δῆμος πατί</foreign>p. The It mother­ <lb/>
            city," because of the many colonies which it sent out: on the founda­ <lb/>
            tion of Thebes, Pliny, B. v, c. 19, says: " Sidon, artifex vitri, Thebarum <lb/>
            Bœotiarum parens." We find in the Scriptures, that Tyre and Sidon <lb/>
            were famous for works in gold, embroidery, &amp;c., and whatsoever <lb/>
            regarded magnificence and luxury,-See Isaiah xxiii.—Ezek. xxvii. <lb/>
            xxviii. The Phœnicians were, in very early times, celebrated for mer­ <lb/>
            chandise of every description; and their country was justly considered <lb/>
            the emporium of the East. They were the earliest navigators, and <lb/>
            their skill in ship-building may be inferred from 1 Kings, v. 6.— <lb/>

            nians, Astarte. 0 As I was wandering about the city, <lb/>
            surveying the votive offerings in the temples, I saw a paint­ <lb/>
            ing containing a view both of sea and land. Europa† <lb/>
            formed the subject, and the scene was laid partly on the <lb/>
            Phoenician sea, partly on the coast of Sidon. In a meadow <lb/>
            was seen a band of maidens; a bull was swimming in the <lb/>
            sea, directing his course towards Crete, and having a fair <lb/>
            damsel seated upon his back. The meadow was diversified <lb/>
            with flowers intermixed with trees and shrubs; the trees <lb/>
            were near to one another, and their branches ‡ and leaves <lb/>
            united so closely overhead, as to form a cover for the flowers <lb/>
            below. The artist had shewn great skill in managing the <lb/>
            shade; for the sun-rays were seen dispersedly breaking <lb/>
            through the overarching roof of leaves, and lighting up the <lb/>
            meadow, which, situated as I have said, beneath a leafy <lb/>
            screen, was surrounded on all sides by a hedge. Under the <lb/>
            trees, beds of flowers were laid out, in which bloomed the <lb/>
            narcissus, the rose, and the myrtle. Bubbling up from the <lb/>
            ground, a stream flowed through the midst of this enamelled <lb/>
            meadow, watering the flowers and shrubs ; and a gardener <lb/>
            was represented with his pickaxe opening a channel for its <lb/>
            course. The maidens above mentioned were placed by the <lb/>
            painter, in a part of the meadow bordering upon the sea. <lb/>
            Their countenances wore a mingled expression of joy and <lb/>
            fear; they had chaplets upon their heads, their hair fell <lb/>
            dishevelled about their shoulders; their legs were entirely <lb/>
            bare-for a cincture raised their garments above the knee­ <lb/>
            and their feet were unsandalled ; their cheeks were pale and <lb/>
            contracted through alarm ; their eyes were directed towards <lb/>
            the sea; their lips were slightly opened as if about to give <lb/>
            vent to their terror in cries ; their hands were stretched out <lb/>
            towards the bull; they were represented upon the verge of <lb/>

              eager to hasten after the bull, but at the same time fearful <lb/>
              of encountering the waves. The colour of the sea was two­ <lb/>
              fold: towards the land it had a ruddy hue ;* farther out it <lb/>
              was dark blue; foam also, and rocks and waves were repre­ <lb/>
              sented ; the rocks projecting from the shore, and whitened <lb/>
              with foam, caused by the crests of the waves breaking upon <lb/>
              their rugged surface.</p>
          <p>In the midst of the sea, the bull was represented swim­ <lb/>
            ming, the waves rising in mountains from the motion of his <lb/>
            legs. The maiden was seated upon his back, not astride, <lb/>
            but sideways; she grasped his horn with her left hand, as a <lb/>
            charioteer would hold the reins; and the bull inclined his <lb/>
            head in that direction, as if guided by her hand.</p>
          <p>She was dressed in a white tunic as far as her middle, the <lb/>
            rest of her body was clothed in a purple robe; the whole <lb/>
            dress, however, was so transparent t as to disclose the beau­ <lb/>
            ties of her person. You could discern the deep-seated <lb/>
            navel, the well proportioned ‡ stomach, the narrow waist, <lb/>
            gradually widening until it reached the chest, the gently <lb/>
            budding breasts. §—These, as well as the tunic, were con­ <lb/>
            fined by a cincture, and from its transparency, the tunic be­ <lb/>
            came, so to speak, a mirror to reflect her person. Both her <lb/>
            hands were extended, one towards the horn, the other <lb/>
            towards the tail; and with either of them she held an ex­ <lb/>
            tremity of the veil which was expanded above her shoulders, <lb/>
            and which appeared in every part inflated by the artist's <lb/>
            " painted wind." ||</p>
          <p>Thus seated upon the bull, the maiden resembled a vessel <note type="footnote"> * “Mare purpureum.”—Virg. G. 4, 373. </note><note type="footnote"> t In Ode xxviii, on his mistress, Anacreon says,— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              leaped, Loves sported round the bull; you might have sworn <lb/>
              that they moved “ instinct with life.” Cupid, in person, was <lb/>
              drawing on the bull; Cupid, in guise of a little child, was <lb/>
              spreading his wings, bearing his quiver, holding his torch, and <lb/>
              turning towards Jove, was archly laughing as if in mockery <lb/>
              of him, who, on his account had become a bull.</p>
          <p>I admired every part of this painting, but my attention <lb/>
            was more especially rivetted upon Cupid leading forward the <lb/>
            bull; and I exclaimed, How wonderfully docs a mere child <lb/>
            lord it over heaven and earth and sea ! ‡</p>
          <p>Upon this, a young man, who happened to be standing near, <lb/>
            said, " I can speak from experience of the power of Love, <lb/>
            having suffered so severely from his caprices.”—“ Pray <lb/>
            said I, “ what are the ills which you have suffered ? To <lb/>
            speak the truth, your countenance betokens you to be not <lb/>
            unacquainted with the mysteries of this deity.”—“ You are <lb/>
            stirring like a whole swarm of words," replied he, " mystery <lb/>
            will sound like a fable.”—“In the name of Jupiter and <lb/>
            Love himself, my good fellow," rejoined I, " do not hesitate <lb/>
            to gratify my curiosity, however fabulous may seem your <lb/>
            story."</p>
          <p>After this, taking him by the hand, I led him to a neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring grove, thickly planted with plane trees, through <lb/>
            which flowed a stream of water, cold and transparent as that <lb/>
            which proceeds from newly melted snow. § Having placed <lb/>

              agreeable and exactly suited for a love story." Upon this, <lb/>
              be began as follows :-</p>
          <p>I am a native of Phœnicia, was born at Tyre, and am <lb/>
            named Clitopho; my father's name is Hippias; Sostratus <lb/>
            is the name of his brother by the father's side-for the two <lb/>
            had different mothers-the latter having a Byzantian, the <lb/>
            former a Tyrian lady for his mother. Sostratus always <lb/>
            resided at Byzantium, having inherited large property in <lb/>
            that city from his mother; lilY father lived at Tyre. I never <lb/>
            saw my mother, she having died during my Infancy : after <lb/>
            her decease, my father married a second wife, by whom ho <lb/>
            had a daughter named Calligone, whom he designed to unite <lb/>
            to me in marriage.* The will of the Fates, however, more <lb/>
            powerful than that of men, had in store for me a different <lb/>
            wife. Now, the Deity is often wont to reveal the future to <lb/>
            mortals, in dreams by night; not in order that they may <lb/>
            ward off suffering (for it is impossible to defeat destiny t ), <lb/>
            but that they may bear more lightly their load of evils. <lb/>
            Calamity, when it comes suddenly and in a “whole battalion," <lb/>
            paralyses, and, as it were, overwhelms the soul by its unex­ <lb/>
            pectedness, whereas when anticipated and dwelt upon by <lb/>
            the mind, the edge of grief becomes blunted. It was when <lb/>
            I had reached the age of nineteen, and when my father was <lb/>
            preparing to have my marriage celebrated, the following <lb/>
            year, that the drama of my fate began. During my sleep, <lb/>
            methought I had coalesced with, and grown into, the person <lb/>
            of a maiden, as far as the middle, and that from thence up­ <lb/>
            ward we formed two bodies. A tall and terrible-looking <lb/>
            woman, savage in aspect, with blood-shot eyes, inflamed <lb/>
            cheeks, and snaky hair, stood over us. In her right hand <lb/>
            she held a scimitar, in her left, a torch. Angrily raising <lb/>
            her falchion, she let it fall exactly upon the loins where was <lb/>
            the juncture of our bodies, and severed the maiden from <lb/>
            me. Leaping up in terror, I mentioned the dream to no <note type="footnote"> * Proximity by blood or consanguinity was not, with some few <lb/>
            exceptions, a bar to marriage in any part of Greece; direct lineal <lb/>
            descent was. Thus brothers were permitted to marry with sisters <lb/>
            even, if not born from the same mother, as Cimon did with Elpenice. <lb/>

              one, but foreboded evil in my own mind. Meanwhile, a <lb/>
              messenger arrived from Byzantium, bringing a letter from <lb/>
              my father's brother; it contained the following words:­</p>
          <p>" Sostratus to his brother Hippias, sends greeting,</p>
          <p>" My daughter Leucippe, and my wife Panthea, are on <lb/>
            their way to you, for war has broken out between the Thra­ <lb/>
            cians and Byzantians; till it is concluded, keep under your <lb/>
            protection those dearest objects of my affection. Farewell."</p>
          <p>No sooner had my father read the letter than, rising <lb/>
            from his seat, he hurried down to the harbour; and not long <lb/>
            after returned, followed by a number of male and female <lb/>
            slaves, whom Sostratus had sent with his wife and daughter. <lb/>
            Among them was a tall lady, richly dressed: while looking <lb/>
            at her, I remarked at her left hand, a maiden, the beauty of <lb/>
            whose countenance at once dazzled my eyes—she resembled <lb/>
            the Europa, whom, in the picture I had seen sitting upon <lb/>
            the bull. Her sparkling # eyes had a pleasing expression, <lb/>
            her hair was golden-hued, short and curling, her eyebrows <lb/>
            were jet black, her cheeks were fair, save that in the middle <lb/>
            they had a tinge bordering upon purple, like that with which <lb/>
            the Lydian women stain the ivory; t her mouth was like <lb/>
            the rose when it begins to bud. No sooner did I see her <lb/>
            than my fate was sealed-for beauty ‡ inflicts a wound <lb/>
            sharper than any arrow, finding a passage to the soul <lb/>
            through the eyes, for it is the eye which makes a way for the <lb/>
            wounds of love. I was overwhelmed by conflicting feelings; <lb/>
            admiration, astonishment, agitation, shame, assurance: I <lb/>
            admired her figure, I was astonished at her beauty; my heart <lb/>
            palpitated, I gazed upon her with assurance, yet I was <figure type="illustration">

              ashamed at the idea of being remarked. I endeavoured to <lb/>
              withdraw my eyes from the maiden; they however were un­ <lb/>
              willing to obey, and, following the fascination of her counte­ <lb/>
              nance, in the end completely gained the day.</p>
          <p>Upon the arrival of the visitors, my father assigned a part <lb/>
            of the house for their use, and then ordered the supper to <lb/>
            be prepared. At the appointed time we reclined by twos <lb/>
            on couches, for such was my father'is order. He and I were <lb/>
            in the centre, the two elder ladies occupied the right-hand <lb/>
            couch, the maidens were to the left. Upon bearing the <lb/>
            proposed arrangement I was very near embracing my father, <lb/>
            for thus placing the maiden within my view. As to what I <lb/>
            ate, on my faith I cannot tell you, for I was like a man eat­ <lb/>
            ing in a dream ; all I know is, that leaning upon my elbow, <lb/>
            and bending forwards, my whole attention was given to steal­ <lb/>
            ing furtive glances at her—this was the sum total of my sup­ <lb/>
            per. When the meal was ended, a slave came in with the lyre; <lb/>
            he first ran over the strings with his fingers, then sounded <lb/>
            a few chords in an under tone, and afterwards taking the <lb/>
            plectrum, began to play, accompanying the sounds with his <lb/>
            voice. The subject of his strain was * Apollo in his irrita­ <lb/>
            tion pursuing the flying Daphne, and upon the point of <lb/>
            seizing her, how she was transformed into a laurel, and how <lb/>
            the god crowns himself with its leaves. The song had the <lb/>
            effect of adding fuel to my flame, for amatory strains t act <lb/>
            as a powerful incentive to desire: and however inclined a <lb/>
            person may be to chastity, example serves as a stimulant to <lb/>
            imitation, more especially when the example is supplied by <lb/>
            one in superior ‡. station; for the feeling of shame which <lb/>
            was a check upon doing wrong becomes changed into as­ <lb/>
            surance by the rank of the offender.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, I thus reasoned with myself—“ See, Apollo <lb/>
            falls in love, he is not ashamed of his weakness, he pursues <lb/>
            the fair one! and art thou a laggard and the slave of shame <note type="footnote"> * Ovid. Met. L 452. <lb/>

            and ill-timed continence P Art thou, forsooth, superior to a <lb/>
            god P ”* In the evening the ladies retired to rest first, and <lb/>
            afterwards we ourselves. The others had confined the <lb/>
            pleasures of the table to their stomachs, t I, for my part, <lb/>
            carried away the banquet in my eyes; I had taken my fill of <lb/>
            the maiden's sweet looks, and, from the effect of merely <lb/>
            gazing upon her, I rose from table intoxicated with love. <lb/>
            Upon entering my accustomed chamber, sleep was out of <lb/>
            the question. It is the law of nature that diseases and <lb/>
            bodily wounds always become exasperated at night; when <lb/>
            we are taking our rest their strength increases, and the pain <lb/>
            becomes more acute, for the circumstance of the body being <lb/>
            in repose affords leisure for the malady to do its work. <lb/>
            By the same rule, the wounds of the soul are much more <lb/>
            painful while the body is lying motionless ; in the day, both <lb/>
            the eyes and ears are occupied by a multiplicity of objects; <lb/>
            thus, the soul has not leisure to feel pain, and so the vio­ <lb/>
            lence of the disease is for a time mitigated; but let the <lb/>
            body be fettered by inactivity, and then the soul retains all <lb/>
            its susceptibility, and becomes tempest-tossed by trouble; <lb/>
            the feelings which were asleep then awaken. The mourner <lb/>
            feels his grief, the anxious his solicitude, he who is in peril <lb/>
            his terrors, the lover his inward flame.</p>
          <p>Towards morning Love took compassion upon me, and <lb/>
            granted me some short repose ; but not even then would the <lb/>
            maiden be absent from my mind; Leucippe ‡ was in all .my <lb/>
            dreams, I conversed with her, I played with her, I supped <lb/>
            with her, I touched her fair body ; in short, I obtained more <lb/>
            favours then than in the day-time, for I kissed her, and the <lb/>
            kiss was really given. Accordingly, when the slave awoke <lb/>
            me, I cursed § him for coming so unseasonably, and for dis­ <note type="footnote"> * “ Egone homuncio id non facerem ! ”—Ter. Eunuchus. </note><note type="footnote"> t “ Quæ ad beatam vitam pertinent ventre metiri.”—Cic. de Nat <lb/>

              sipating so sweet a dream; getting up, however, I went our <lb/>
              of my part of the house, and walked in front of the apart­ <lb/>
              ment where the maiden was; with my head hanging down <lb/>
              over a book, I pretended to be reading, but whenever ] <lb/>
              came opposite her door I cast sidelong glances, and after <lb/>
              taking a few turns, and drinking in fresh draughts of love <lb/>
              I returned desperately smitten; three whole days did I con­ <lb/>
              tinue burning with this inward fire.</p>
          <p>I had a cousin named Clinias, who had lost both his <lb/>
            parents ; he was two years older than myself, and an adept <lb/>
            in matters of love. He had a male favourite, for whom his <lb/>
            affection was so strong, that when he had one day purchased <lb/>
            a horse, and the other admired it, he immediately presented <lb/>
            him with the animal. I was always joking him for having <lb/>
            so much leisure as to fall in love, and for being a slave to <lb/>
            tender passions; be used to laugh and reply with a shake of <lb/>
            the head, " Depend upon it the day of slavery is in store for <lb/>
            you." Well, proceeding to his house, I saluted him, and <lb/>
            sitting down, said, " Clinias, I am paying the penalty of my <lb/>
            former gibes I am at last myself the slave of love !” Upon <lb/>
            hearing this, he clapped his hands and laughed outright; <lb/>
            then rising and kissing my face, which bore traces of a <lb/>
            lover's wakefulness, " There is no doubt of your being in <lb/>
            love," said he, " for your eyes declare it."</p>
          <p>While he was yet speaking, Charicles, his favourite, <lb/>
            comes in hurriedly and in great perturbation, exclaiming, <lb/>
            " My fate is sealed, Clinias !” With a tremulous voice, and <lb/>
            sighing as deeply as though his own life hung t upon that <lb/>
            of the youth, Clinias replied, " Speak out, your silence will <lb/>
            be my death ; say what grief assails you—with what adver­ <lb/>
            sary have you to contend Charicles rejoined,—“ My father <lb/>

            she comely, a female * would be repulsive to my taste, and <lb/>
            she becomes doubly so, if ugly. My father, however, looks <lb/>

            that I, such is my ill fate, am made the victim of this <lb/>
            woman's money; I am sold to be her husband."† Clinias <lb/>
            turned pale upon hearing this announcement, and strongly <lb/>
            urged the youth to decline the match, bitterly inveighing <lb/>
            against the race of womankind. " Your father, forsooth, <lb/>
            would have you marry! pray what crime have you commit­ <lb/>
            ted, that you should be given over to such bondage ? Do <lb/>
            you not remember the words of Jove ? <lb/>
            ' Son of Iapetus, o'er-subtle, go, <lb/>
            And glory in thy artful theft below ; <lb/>
            Now of the fire you boast by stealth retrieval, <lb/>
            And triumph in almighty Jove deceiv'd ; <lb/>
            But thou too late shalt find the triumph vain, <lb/>
            And read thy folly in succeeding pain ; <lb/>
            Posterity the sad effect shall know, <lb/>
            When in pursuit of joy they grasp their woe.' ‡ <lb/>
            Woman is a ' bitter sweet ;'§ in her nature she is akin to <lb/>
            the Sirens, for they too, slay their victims with a dulcet <lb/>
            voice; the very " pomp and circumstance" of marriage <lb/>
            shews the magnitude of the evil; there is the din || of pipes, <lb/>
            the knocking at the doors, the bearing about of torches. <lb/>
            With all this noise and tumult, who will not exclaim,' Un­ <lb/>

            man ordered off to war. Were you unacquainted with <lb/>

              riage, there is this evil, it saps the vigour: do not, Charicles, <lb/>
              I pray, expose yourself to this; give not the beauteous rose <lb/>
              to be plucked by the ill-favoured rustic's hand."</p>
          <p>" Leave this matter," replied Charicles, " to the care of <lb/>
            the gods and of myself; the marriage will not take place <lb/>
            for some days yet; much may be done in a single night, <lb/>
            and we will deliberate at our leisure. Meanwhile, I will go <lb/>
            and take a ride, for since the day you gave me that fine <lb/>
            horse, I have never made use of your kind present." With <lb/>
            these words he left the house, little imagining that this his <lb/>
            first ride was to be his last. After he was gone, I related <lb/>
            every particular to Clinias, describing how my passion <lb/>
            began; the arrival, the supper, the beauty of the maiden. <lb/>
            Feeling, at last, how absurdly I was beginning to talk, I <lb/>
            exclaimed, " Clinias, I can no longer endure this misery. <lb/>
            Love has assailed me with such violence as to drive sleep <lb/>
            from my eyes; I see no object but Leucippe; no one can <lb/>
            suffer like myself, for the source of my trouble dwells with <lb/>
            me under the same roof."</p>
          <p>" What folly it is," replied Clinias, "for you who are so <lb/>
            fortunate in love to talk after this fashion! You have no <lb/>
            need to go to another person's doors; you do not require a <lb/>
            go-between; fortune gives the loved object into your hands, <lb/>
            brings her into your very house, and there sets her down.- <lb/>
            Other lovers are well content with catching a glimpse of <lb/>
            the maiden for whom they sigh, and to gratify their eyes is <lb/>
            with them no small good fortune; they consider themselves <lb/>
            most favoured, indeed, if they can now and then exchange a <lb/>
            word with their mistress. But what is your case ? You <lb/>
            continually see her, you continually hear her voice, you <lb/>
            sup with her, you drink with her; and yet, fortunate that <lb/>
            you are, you are complaining! You are guilty of base <lb/>
            ingratitude towards love, and without the slightest cause. <lb/>
            Do you not know that seeing the object whom you love <lb/>
            gives far deeper pleasure than enjoying her?† And why <lb/>
            so? Because the eyes, when encountering each other, <note type="footnote"> * of Semper conservam domi <lb/>

            receive bodily impressions, as in a looking-glass, and the <lb/>
            reflection of beauty glancing into the soul,* begets union <lb/>
            even in separation, and affords a pleasure not much inferior <lb/>
            to corporeal intercourse, which, after all, is hollow and <lb/>
            unsatisfying.! I augur, moreover, that you will soon obtain <lb/>
            the object of your wishes, for to be always in the society of <lb/>
            the loved one, exerts a most persuasive power; the eye is a <lb/>
            wondrous vehicle of love,‡ and constant intercourse is most <lb/>
            influential in begetting kindly feelings. Habit and the <lb/>
            company of each other will tame savage beasts. How much <lb/>
            more will they act upon a woman's heart. Parity of age <lb/>
            also has great weight with a maiden, and the animal passion <lb/>
            which is felt in the flower of youth, added to the conscious­ <lb/>
            ness of being loved, very frequently call forth a return of <lb/>
            tender feeling. Every maiden wishes to be thought beau­ <lb/>
            tiful, and exults in being loved; and approves the testimony <lb/>
            borne by the lover to her beauty; because, if no one love <lb/>
            her, she believes herself devoid of any personal charms. <lb/>
            This one piece of advice I give you, make her feel certain <lb/>
            that she is beloved, and she will soon follow your example in <lb/>
            returning your affection.'</p>
          <p>" And how," asked I, " is this sage oracle of yours to be <lb/>
            accomplished ? Put me in the right way; you are more <lb/>
            experienced than myself; you have been longer initiated in <lb/>
            the mysteries of love.. What am I to do ? What am I to <lb/>
            say P How am I to obtain her for whom I sigh ? For my <lb/>
            part I am ignorant how to set about the work."</p>
          <p>" There is small need," replied Clinias, " to learn these <lb/>
            matters from the mouths of others. Love is a self-taught <lb/>
            master of his craft.§ No one teaches new-born babes <lb/>
            where to find their food; they have already learnt by in­ <lb/>
            tuition, and know that a table has been spread for them by <lb/>
            nature in their mothers' breasts. In like manner, the youth <lb/>
            who for the first time is pregnant with love, needs no <lb/>

              come on, and your hour have arrived, and though it be for <lb/>
              the first time, you will not miscarry, but will be safely <lb/>
              brought to bed, midwifed by the god himself. I will, how­ <lb/>
              ever, give you a few common-place hints relating to matters <lb/>
              which require general observance. Say nothing to the <lb/>
              maiden directly bearing upon love; prosecute the wished-for <lb/>
              consummation quietly. Youths and maidens are alike sen­ <lb/>
              sible of shame, and however much they may long for sexual <lb/>
              enjoyment, they do not like to hear it talked of; they <lb/>
              consider the disgrace of the matter to be altogether in the <lb/>
              words. Matrons take pleasure even in the words. A <lb/>
              maiden will show no objection to acts of dalliance upon her <lb/>
              lover's part, but will express her willingness by signs and <lb/>
              gestures; yet if you come directly to the point, and put the <lb/>
              question to her, your very voice will alarm her ears; she <lb/>
              will be suffused with blushes; she will turn away from your <lb/>
              proposals; she will think an insult has been done her; and <lb/>
              however willing to comply with your desires, she will be <lb/>
              restrained by shame; for the pleasurable sensations excited <lb/>
              by your words will make her consider herself to be sub­ <lb/>
              mitting to the act. But when by other means you have <lb/>
              brought her to a compliant mood, so that you can approach <lb/>
              her with some degree of freedom, be as wise and guarded. <lb/>
              as though you were celebrating the mysteries ;* gently ap­ <lb/>
              proach and kiss her: a kiss given by a lover to a willing <lb/>
              mistress is a silent way of asking for her favours; and the <lb/>
              same given to the fair one who is coy, is a supplication to <lb/>
              relent. Even when maidens are themselves ready to com­ <lb/>
              ply, they often like some appearance of force to be em­ <lb/>
              ployed,† for the plea of seeming necessity will remove the <lb/>
              shame of voluntary compliance upon their part. Do not be <lb/>
              discouraged if she repulses your advance,‡ but mark the <note type="footnote"> *The festivals called Mysteries took place at night, or in secret, <lb/>

              yielding, act still with proper caution, least after all you <lb/>

          <p>" You have given me storet of good advice," said I, " and <lb/>
            may everything turn out successfully; nevertheless I sadly <lb/>
            fear that success will prove the beginning of even greater <lb/>
            calamity, by making me more desperately in love. What <lb/>
            am I to do if my malady increase r I cannot marry, for I <lb/>
            am already engaged to another maiden ; my father, too, is <lb/>
            very urgent with me to conclude the match, and he asks <lb/>
            nothing but what is fair and reasonable. He does not <lb/>
            barter me away like Charicles for gold; he does not wish <lb/>
            me to marry either a foreigner or an ugly girl; he gives me <lb/>
            his own daughter, a maiden of rare beauty, had I not seen <lb/>
            Leucippe; but now I am blind to all other charms except­ <lb/>
            ing hers, in short, I have eyes for her alone. I am placed <lb/>
            midway between two contending parties; Love on one side, <lb/>
            my father on the other; the latter wields his paternal <lb/>
            authority, the former shakes his burning torch; how am I . <lb/>
            to decide the cause ? Stern necessity and natural affection <lb/>
            are opposed. Father, I wish to give a verdict for you, but <lb/>
            I have an adversary too strong for me; he tortures and <lb/>
            overawes the judge,‡ he stands beside me with his shafts; <lb/>

          <p>While we were thus discussing the subject of the god of <lb/>
            Love, a slave of Charicles suddenly rushed in bearing his <lb/>

            dashed wildly on.. Taking the bit between his teeth, with <lb/>
            neck thrown up and tossing mane, maddened with fright, <lb/>
            he flew through the air.t Such was his speed, that his <lb/>
            hind feet seemed endeavouring to overtake and pass the <lb/>
            fore feet in the race; and owing to this rivalry of speed <lb/>
            between the legs, the animal's back rose and fell as does a <lb/>
            ship when tossing upon the billows. Oscillating from the <lb/>
            effect of these wave-like movements,‡ the wretched Chari­ <lb/>
            cles was tossed up and down like a ball upon the horse's <lb/>
            back, now thrown back upon his croup, now pitched forward <lb/>
            upon his neck. At length overmastered by the storm,§ and <lb/>
            unable to recover possession of the reins, he gave himself <lb/>
            up to this whirlwind of speed, and was at Fortune's mercy. <lb/>
            The horse still in full career, turned from the public road, <note type="footnote"> * " And, starting to each accent, sprang <lb/>

            tree. Cbaricles was shot from off his back as from an <lb/>
            engine, and his face encountering the boughs, was lacerated <lb/>
            with a wound from every jagged point. Entangled by the <lb/>
            reins, he was unable to release his body, but was dragged <lb/>
            along upon the road to death; for the horse, yet more <lb/>

            moments speechless through bewilderment, then awakening <lb/>
            from his trance of grief, he uttered a piercing cry, and was <lb/>
            rushing out to meet the corpse, I following and doing my <lb/>
            best to comfort him. At this instant the body of Charicles <lb/>
            was borne into the house, a wretched and pitiable sight, for <lb/>
            he was one mass of wounds,! so that none of the bystanders <lb/>
            could restrain their tears. His father led the strains of <lb/>
            lamentation, and cried out, " My son, in how different a <lb/>

            death has taken away the soul, but leaves in the body the <lb/>
            semblance of the individual: in thy case, fate has destroyed <lb/>
            both, and, to me, thou hast died a double death, in soul and <lb/>
            body, so utterly has even the shadow of thy likeness <lb/>
            perished! Thy soul has fled, and I find thee no more, even <lb/>
            in body! Oh, my son, when shall be now thy bridal day P <lb/>
            When, ill-starred horseman and unwedded bridegroom, <lb/>
            when shall be the joyous nuptial festivities? The tomb <lb/>
            will be thy bridal bed, death thy partner, a dirge thy <lb/>
            nuptial song, wailing thy strains of joy !* I thought, my <lb/>
            son, to have kindled for thee a very different flame, but <lb/>
            cruel fate has extinguished both it and thee, and in its <lb/>
            stead lights up the funeral torch. Oh, luckless torch <lb/>
            bearing, where death presides and takes the place of mar­ <lb/>

          <p>Thus bitterly did the father bewail the loss of his son, <lb/>
            and Clinias vied with him in the expression of his grief, <lb/>
            breaking forth into soliloquy. " I have been the death of <lb/>
            him who was master of my affection! Why was I so ill­ <lb/>
            advised as to present him with such a gift! Could I not have <lb/>
            given him a golden beaker, out of which, when pouring a <lb/>
            libation, he might have drunk, and so have derived pleasure <lb/>
            from the gift ? Instead of doing this, wretch that I was, I <lb/>
            bestowed upon this beauteous youth a savage brute, and <lb/>
            moreover decked out the beast with a pectoral and frontlet <lb/>
            and silver trappings.† Yes, Charicles, I decked out your <lb/>
            murderer with gold! Thou beast, of all others most evil, <lb/>
            ruthless, ungrateful, and insensible to beauty, thou host <lb/>
            actually been the death of him who fondled thee, who wiped <lb/>
            away thy sweat, promised thee many a feed, and praised the <lb/>
            swiftness of thy pace! Instead of glorying in being the <lb/>
            bearer of so fair a youth, thou hast ungratefully dashed his <lb/>
            beauty to the earth! Woe is me, for having bought this <lb/>
            homicide, who has turned out to be thy murderer!"</p>
          <p>No sooner were the funeral obsequies over, than I hastened <lb/>
            to the maiden, who was in the pleasance belonging to the <note type="footnote"> * In Heliodorus, B. i. Theagenes and Charicles express their grief <lb/>

            house. It consisted of a grovo, which afforded a delightful <lb/>
            object to the eyes; around it ran a wall, each of the four <lb/>
            sides of which had a colonnade supported upon pillars, the <lb/>
            central space being planted with trees, whose branches were <lb/>
            so closely interwoven, that the fruits and foliage inter­ <lb/>
            mingled in friendly union.* Close to some of the larger <lb/>
            trees grew the ivy and the convolvulus; the latter hanging <lb/>
            from the plane-trees, clustered round it, with its delicate <lb/>
            foliage; the former twining round the pine, lovingly em­ <lb/>
            braced its trunk, so that the tree became the prop of the <lb/>
            ivy, and the ivy furnished a crown for the tree. On <lb/>
            either side were seen luxuriant vines, supported upon <lb/>
            reeds; these were now in blossom, and hanging down from <lb/>
            the intervening spaces were the ringlets of the plant;t <lb/>
            while the upper leaves, agitated by the breeze and inter- <lb/>
            penetrated by the rays of the sun, caused a quivering <lb/>
            gleam to fall upon the ground, which partially lighted <lb/>
            up its shade. Flowers also displayed the beauty of <lb/>
            their various hues. The narcissus, the rose, and violet, <lb/>
            mingling together, imparted a purple colour to the earth; <lb/>
            the calyx of both these flowers was alike in its general <lb/>
            shape, and served them for a cup; the expanded rose-leaves <lb/>
            were red and violet above, milky white below, and the nar­ <lb/>
            cissus was altogether of the latter hue; the violet had no <lb/>
            calyx, and its colour resembled that of the sea when under <lb/>
            the influence of a calm. In the midst of the flowers bubbled <lb/>
            a fountain, whoso waters received into a square basin, <lb/>
            the work of art, served the flowers for their mirror, and gave <lb/>
            a double appearance to the grove, by adding the reflection <lb/>
            to the reality. Neither were there wanting birds: some of <lb/>
            a domestic kind, reared by the care of man, were feeding in <lb/>
            the grove; while others, enjoying their liberty of wing, flew <lb/>
            and disported themselves among the branches. The song­ <lb/>
            sters were grasshoppers‡ and swallows,§ of which the one <note type="footnote"> * See the description of the garden in the 3rd Book of Longus. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              celebrated the rising of Aurora, the other the banquet of <lb/>
              Tereus. Those of a domestic kind were the peacock, the <lb/>
              swan, and the parrot; the swan was feeding near the foun­ <lb/>
              tain; a cage suspended from a tree contained the parrot; <lb/>
              the peacock drew after him his splendid train; nor was it <lb/>
              easy to decide which surpassed the other in beauty, the <lb/>
              tints of the flowers themselves, or the hues of his flower­ <lb/>
              like feathers.</p>
          <p>Leucippe happened at this time to be walking with Clio, <lb/>
            and stopped opposite the peacock who was just then spread­ <lb/>
            ing his train, and displaying the gorgeous semicircle of his <lb/>
            feathers.. Wishing to produce amorous sensations in her <lb/>
            mind, I addressed myself to the slave Satyrus,† making <lb/>
            the peacock the subject of our discourse. “ The bird," I <lb/>
            said, “ does not do this without design ; he is of an amorous <lb/>
            nature, and always bedecks himself in this manner when he <lb/>
            wishes to attract his favourite mate. Do you see," I added, <lb/>
            (pointing in the direction) " the female, near the plane tree <lb/>
            yonder ? It is to her that he is now displaying the <lb/>
            ‛ enamelled meadow’ of his plumes, and this meadow of his <lb/>
            is assuredly more beautiful than any mead in nature, each <lb/>
            plume has in it a spot of gold, and the gold is encircled by <lb/>
            a purple ring, and so in every plume there is seen an eye. ’ <lb/>
            Satyrus readily comprehended the drift of my discourse, and <lb/>
            in order to give me scope for continuing the subject, he <lb/>
            asked " whether Love could possibly possess such power as to <lb/>
            transmit his warmth even unto the winged tribes? ” “Yes," <lb/>
            I replied, not only unto them-for there is no marvel in this, <lb/>
            since he himself is winged-but also into reptiles and wild <note type="footnote"> and REsch. Ag. 1017, nevertheless is introduced by Moschus, in his <lb/>

            beasts and plants; nay, in my opinion oven unto atones. <lb/>
            The magnet, for instance loves the iron, and upon the first <lb/>
            eight and touch draws that metal towards it, as if containing <lb/>
            within itself the fire of love. Is there not in this, a mani­ <lb/>
            fest embrace between the amorous stone and the iron the <lb/>
            object of its affection ? Philosophers, moreover, tell, con­ <lb/>
            cerning plants, what I should deem an idle tale were it not <lb/>
            confirmed by the experience of husbandmen. They main­ <lb/>
            tain that one plant becomes enamoured of another, and that <lb/>
            the palm is most sensible of the tender passion ; there are, <lb/>
            you must know, male. and female palms; supposing the <lb/>
            female is planted at a distance from it, the male droops and <lb/>
            withers; the husbandman upon seeing this, easily under­ <lb/>
            stands the nature of the malady, and ascending an eminence <lb/>
            he observes in what direction the tree inclines—which is <lb/>
            always towards the beloved object; having ascertained this <lb/>
            point, he employs the following remedy : taking a shoot <lb/>
            from the female he inserts it into the very heart of the <lb/>
            male; this immediately revives it, and bestows new life <lb/>
            upon its sinking frame, so that it recovers its pristine <lb/>
            vigour; and this arises from delight in embracing its <lb/>
            beloved ; such are the loves of the plants.†</p>
          <p>" The same holds true concerning streams and rivers also; <lb/>
            for we hear of the loves of the river Alpheus and the Sici­ <lb/>
            lian fountain Arethusa .‡ This river takes its course through <lb/>
            the sea as through a plain, and the sea instead of impreg­ <lb/>
            nating it with its saltness, divides and so affords a passage <lb/>
            for the river, performing the part of bridesman,§ by con­ <lb/>
            ducting it to Arethusa; when, therefore, at the Olympic <lb/>

              river, it immediately bears them to its beloved, these being <lb/>
              its nuptial gifts.* A yet stranger mystery of Love is seen <lb/>
              in reptiles, not merely in those of like race, but of different <lb/>
              kind. The viper t conceives a violent passion for the lam­ <lb/>
              prey, which though in form a serpent, is to all intents and <lb/>
              purposes a fish. When these reptiles wish to copulate, the <lb/>
              viper goes down to the shore and hisses in the direction of <lb/>
              the sea, which is a signal to the lamprey; s'he understands <lb/>
              the sound, and issues from the water, but does not imme­ <lb/>
              diately hasten to her lover, knowing that he carries deadly <lb/>
              poison in his teeth, but gliding up a rock, there waits until <lb/>
              he has cleansed his mouth. After looking at one another <lb/>
              for a space, the loving viper vomits forth the poison so <lb/>
              dreaded by his mistress, and she upon perceiving this, <lb/>
              descends and entwines him in her embrace, no longer <lb/>
              dreading his amorous bite."</p>
          <p>During my discourse, I kept observing Leucippe to see <lb/>
            how she took these amatory topics, and she gave indi­ <lb/>
            cations that they were not displeasing to her. The dazzling <lb/>
            beauty of the peacock which I just now mentioned seemed <lb/>
            to me far inferior to her attractions; indeed the beauty of <lb/>
            her countenance might vie with the flowers of the meadow; <lb/>
            the narcissus was resplendent in her general complexion, <lb/>
            the rose blushed upon her check, the dark hue of tho violet <lb/>
            sparkled in her eyes, her ringlets curled more closely than <lb/>
            do the clusters of the ivy ;—her face, therefore, was a reflex <lb/>
            of the meadows.‡ Shortly after this, she left the pleasance, <lb/>
            it being time for her to practise upon the harp. Though <lb/>
            absent she appeared to me still present, for her form and <lb/>
            features remained impressed upon my eyes.</p>
          <p>Satyrus and I congratulated each other upon our mutual <lb/>
            performances. I for the subjects I had chosen, he for having <lb/>
            given me the opportunity of discussing them. Supper time <lb/>

            reality because I could not bear her to be out of my <lb/>
            sight, for however short a space. The first subject of her <lb/>
            song was, the engagement between the lion and the boar, <lb/>
            described by Homer;* afterwards she chose a tenderer <lb/>
            theme, the praises of the rose.</p>
          <p>Divested of its poetic ornaments,! the purport of the <lb/>
            strain was this: Had Jove wished to impose a monarch <lb/>
            upon the flowers, this honor would have been given to the <lb/>
            rose, ‡ as being the ornament of the earth, the boast of <lb/>
            shrubs, the eye of flowers, imparting a blush to the mea­ <lb/>
            dows and dazzling with its beauty. The rose breathes of <lb/>
            love, conciliates Venus, glories in its fragrant leaves, exults <lb/>
            in its tender stalks, which are gladdened by the Zephyr. <lb/>
            Such was the matter of the song. For my part, I seemed <lb/>
            to behold a rose upon her lips, as though the calyx of the <lb/>
            flower had been converted into the form of the human <lb/>
            mouth. She had scarcely ended when the supper hour <lb/>
            arrived. It was then the time of celebrating the Festival of <lb/>

              esteem to be their god, quoting a legend of Cadmus which <lb/>
              attributes to the feast the following origin: -Once upon a <lb/>
              time, mortals had no such thing as wine, neither the black <lb/>
              and fragrant kind, nor the Biblian, nor the Maronæan,* <lb/>
              nor the Chian, nor the Icarian; all these they maintain <lb/>
              came originally from Tyre, their inventor being a Tyrian. <lb/>
              A certain hospitable neatherd (resembling the Athenian <lb/>
              Icarius, who is the subject of a very similar story) gave <lb/>
              occasion to the legend which I am about to relate. Bacchus <lb/>
              happened to come to the cottage of this countryman, who <lb/>
              set before him whatsoever the earth and the labours of his <lb/>
              oxen had produced. Wine, as I observed, was then unknown, <lb/>
              like the oxen, therefore, their beverage was water.</p>
          <p>Bacchus thanked him for his friendly treatment and pre­ <lb/>
            sented to him a "loving cup," t which was filled with wine. <lb/>
            Having taken a hearty draught, and becoming very jovial <lb/>
            from its effects, he said :—“ Whence, stranger, did you pro­ <lb/>
            cure this purple water, this delicious blood ? It is quite <lb/>
            different from that which flows along the ground; for that <lb/>
            descends into the vitals, and affords cold comfort at the <lb/>
            best; whereas this, even before entering the mouth, rejoices <lb/>
            the nostrils, and though cold to the touch, leaps down into <lb/>
            the stomach and begets a pleasurable warmth.” ‡ To this <lb/>
            Bacchus replied, " This is the water of an autumnal fruit, <lb/>
            this is the blood of the grape,”§ and so saying, he conducted <lb/>
            the neatherd to a vine, and squeezing a bunch of grapes <lb/>
            said, “ here is the water, and this is the <unclear>fountain</unclear> from <lb/>
            whence it flows.” Such is the account which the Tvrians <lb/>
            give as to the origin of wine. <note type="footnote"> * The wine of most early celebrity was that which the minister of <lb/>
            Apollo, Maron, who dwelt upon the skirts of Thracian Ismarus gave <lb/>
            to Ulysses. It was red and honey-sweet ; so precious, that it was <lb/>
            unknown to all in the mansion save the wife of the priest and one <lb/>
            trusty housekeeper; so strong, that a single cup was mixed with <lb/>
            twenty of water; so fragrant, that even when thus diluted it diffused <lb/>
            a divine and most tempting perfume. </note><note type="footnote"> See Odyss. ix. 203.; Diet. of Greek and Roman Antiq. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              </p>
          <p>It was, as I before said, the festival of this deity which <lb/>
            was being celebrated. My father anxious to do everything <lb/>
            handsomely, had made grand preparations for the supper, <lb/>
            and there was set in honor of the go , a magnificent goblet <lb/>
            of crystal,* in the beauty of its workmanship second only <lb/>
            to that of the Chian Glaucus.t Vines seemingly growing <lb/>
            from within encircled it, and their clusters hung down all <lb/>
            around ; as long as the goblet remained empty each grape <lb/>
            appeared unripe and green; but no sooner was the wine <lb/>
            poured in than each grape began to redden, and assumed <lb/>
            the hue of ripeness; and among them was represented Bac­ <lb/>
            chus himself as dresser of the vineyard. As the feast went <lb/>
            on, and the good wine did its office, I began to cast bold <lb/>
            lawless glances at Leucippe; for Love and Bacchus are two <lb/>
            very potent deities, they take possession of the soul ‡ and <lb/>
            so inflame it that it forgets every restraint of modesty; the <lb/>
            one kindles in it a flame, and the other supplies fuel for the <lb/>
            fire, for wine may truly be called the meat and drink of <lb/>
            love. The maiden also became gradually emboldened so as <lb/>
            to gaze at me more fixedly. In this manner, ten days <lb/>
            passed on without anything beyond glances being inter­ <lb/>
            changed between us.</p>
          <p>At length I imparted the whole affair to Satyrus, request­ <lb/>
            ing his assistance; he replied, " I knew it all before you <lb/>
            told me, but was unwilling that you should be aware of the <lb/>
            fact, supposing it your wish to remain unobserved; for very <lb/>

            covered his passion, and considers himself to have received <lb/>
            an insult from him. However," continued he, " fortune has <lb/>
            provided for our contingences,* for Clio, Leucippe's chamber­ <lb/>
            maid, has an understanding with me, and admits me as her <lb/>
            lover. I will gradually buy her over to give us her assist­ <lb/>
            ance in this affair; but you, on your part, must not be con­ <lb/>
            tent with making trial of the maiden merely by glances; <lb/>
            you must speak to her and say something to the point, <lb/>
            then take a farther step by touching her hand, squeezing <lb/>
            her fingers, and fetching a deep sigh; if she permits this <lb/>
            willingly, then salute her as the mistress of your affections, <lb/>
            and imprint a kiss upon her neck." " By Pallas, you counsel <lb/>
            wisely," was my reply, " but I fear me, I shall prove but a <lb/>
            craven wrestler in the school of love."</p>
          <p>" The god of love," said he, " has no notion of craven- <lb/>
            heartedness ; do you not see in what warlike guise be is <lb/>
            equipped ? He bears a bow, a quiver, arrows, and a lighted <lb/>
            torch, emblems all of them, of manhood and of daring. <lb/>
            Filled, then, as land are with the influence of such a god, <lb/>
            are you a coward and do you tremble ? Beware of shewing <lb/>
            yourself merely a counterfeit in love. I will make an open­ <lb/>
            ing by calling away Clio, as soon as an opportunity occurs <lb/>
            for your having a private conversation with Leucippe." <lb/>
            With these words he left the room; excited by what he <lb/>
            had said, I was no sooner alone, then I used every endea­ <lb/>
            vour to collect my courage for the approaching interview. <lb/>
            " Coward," said I, " how long wilt thou continue silent P <lb/>
            Thou, the soldier of such a warlike ‛ god, and yet a craven.' <lb/>
            Dost thou intend to wait until the maiden comes to thee <lb/>
            of her own accord ? " Afterwards I proceeded, " and yet <lb/>
            fool that thou art, why not come to thy senses ? Why not <lb/>
            bestow thy love upon a lawful object ? Thou hast another <lb/>
            maiden in this house; one possessed of beauty. Be con­ <lb/>
            tent with loving her, and gazing upon her; her it is per­ <lb/>
            mitted thee to take to wife." My purpose was almost fixed; <lb/>
            when from the bottom of my heart Love spoke in reply and <lb/>
            said; " Rash man, darest thou to set thyself in array and to <lb/>
            war with me—me, who have wings to fly, arrows to wound, <lb/>
            and a torch to burn ? How, prythee, wilt thou escape ? If <lb/>
            thou wardest off my shafts, how wilt thou avert my fire P <figure type="illustration">

              and even supposing thy chastity should quench the flame, <lb/>
              still I can overtake thee with my wings.” *</p>
          <p>While engaged in this soliloquy, the maiden unexpectedly <lb/>
            made her appearance ; I turned pale, and the next moment <lb/>
            became crimson; she was quite alone, not even Clio accom­ <lb/>
            panied her; in a very confused manner, and not knowing <lb/>
            what else to say, I addressed her with the words, " Good <lb/>
            morrow, fair mistress;” sweetly smiling, she shewed by her <lb/>
            countenance that she comprehended the drift of my salu­ <lb/>
            tation, and said, “ Do you call me your mistress ?" " Indeed I <lb/>
            do, for one of the gods has told me to be your slave, as Her­ <lb/>
            cules was sold to Omphale." “ Sold, if I remember, by <lb/>
            Mercury,” rejoined she, " and Jove employed him in the <lb/>
            business;" this she said with an arch smile ? " What non­ <lb/>
            sense," rejoined I, " to trifle so, and talk of Mercury when <lb/>
            all the while you understood my meaning." t While one <lb/>
            pleasantry led on to another and so prolonged our conver­ <lb/>
            sation, fortune came to my assistance.</p>
          <p>About noon on the preceding day, Leucippe had been <lb/>
            playing on the harp and Clio was sitting beside her. I <lb/>
            was walking up and down, when suddenly a bee flying in, <lb/>
            stung Clio's hand; she immediately shrieked out, upon <lb/>
            which the maiden, hastily rising from her seat and laying <lb/>
            aside the harp, examined the wound, bidding her to be <lb/>
            under no anxiety, for that she could relieve the pain by <lb/>
            simply uttering two magic words, having been instructed <lb/>
            by an Egyptian how to cure the stings inflicted by bees <lb/>
            and wasps; she then proceeded to utter the words of mean- <figure type="illustration">

              tation, and Clio, in a few moments declared the pain to <lb/>
              be relieved. This, as I intimated, took place on the day <lb/>
              before. On the present occasion it chanced, that a bee <lb/>
              or wasp flew buzzing round my face, when all at once the <lb/>
              idea seized me of feigning myself to have been stung ;* I <lb/>
              did so, putting my hand to my face, and pretending to be in <lb/>
              pain. The maiden came up to me, removed my hand and <lb/>
              enquired where I had been stung; upon my lips, dearest, <lb/>
              was my reply, why do you not charm away the pain ? Ap­ <lb/>
              proaching my face, she placed her mouth almost close to <lb/>
              mine, in order to work the charm, at the same time mur­ <lb/>
              muring certain words, and ever and anon touching my <lb/>
              lips. All this time I kept stealing silent kisses, so that <lb/>
              from the maiden alternately opening and closing her lips <lb/>
              while uttering the charm, the incantation became changed <lb/>
              into one continuous kiss. At last putting my arms around <lb/>
              her, I saluted her lips more ardently ; upon which drawing <lb/>
              back she exclaimed, “ What are you about ? Are you, too, <lb/>
              turned enchanter ?" " I am only kissing the charm which <lb/>
              has removed my pain." She took my meaning and smiled, <lb/>
              which gave me a fresh supply of courage.</p>

            wound at the same time I embraced her more closely and <lb/>
            kissed her with still greater freedom; nor, though making <lb/>

            when lips mingle they dart pleasure through the veins, and <lb/>
            make even the lovers’ souls join in the embrace. Never <lb/>
            before did I feel delight comparable to this; and then for <lb/>

            imitating me, and drinking as I bad done, which, as you may <lb/>
            imagine, vastly increased my happiness. This was repeated <lb/>
            a third and fourth time; in short, we passed the rest of the <lb/>
            time in drinking kisses to one another.</p>
          <p>When supper was ended, Satyrus approaching me said, <lb/>
            " Now is the time to show your mettle; the maiden's <lb/>
            mother, as you are aware, is unwell, and has retired to rest <lb/>
            alone. She herself before going to bed will take a few <lb/>
            turns as usual in the garden, attended by no one but Clio, <lb/>
            whom I will undertake to get out of the way. We then <lb/>
            separated, and remained on the watch, he for Clio, I for <lb/>
            Leucippe. Everything turned out as we had wished ; Clio <lb/>
            was got rid of, and Leucippe remained walking by herself. <lb/>
            I waited till the daylight had faded away,* and then <lb/>
            approached her, emboldened by my former success, like a <lb/>
            soldier already victorious, who therefore scorns the perils of <lb/>
            war. The arms in which I trusted were wine, love, hope, <lb/>
            and solitude; so, without saying a word, and as if every­ <lb/>
            thing had been preconcerted, I took her in my arms, and <lb/>
            covered her with kisses. When about to proceed to other <lb/>
            familiarities, a noise was heard behind us, at which we started <lb/>
            asunder in alarm. She betook herself to her chamber, and <lb/>
            I remained there in great dudgeon at having lost so capital <lb/>
            an opportunity, and execrating the noise which had been <lb/>
            the cause.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Satyrus came up with a laughing countenance. <lb/>
            He had witnessed everything, having concealed himselt <lb/>
            under a tree to guard against our surprise ; and it was be, <lb/>
            who seeing some one approach, had made the noise.</p>
          <p>In the course of a few days, my father made preparations <lb/>
            for concluding my marriage sooner than had been originally <lb/>
            intended. He had been much alarmed by various dreams; <lb/>
            be thought he was celebrating the nuptial rites, and after <lb/>
            the torches had been kindled the light was suddenly extin­ <lb/>
            guished. This made him more anxious to conclude the <lb/>
            matter, and we were now within a day of the one formally <lb/>
            appointed for the ceremony. The wedding clothes and <lb/>
            jewels were already purchased; there was a necklace com­ <note type="footnote"> * The original is highly poetical:—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲπιτήηυς οὖν ὅτε τοῡ φωτος <lb/>

            posed of various gems, and a splendid purple robe edged <lb/>
            with a gold border. The gems vied with each other in <lb/>
            beauty; among them was a hyacinth,* which resembled a <lb/>
            rose, only that it was a stone, and an amethyst almost as <lb/>
            lustrous as gold itself. In the middle of this necklace were <lb/>
            three precious stones, arranged together and curiously <lb/>
            blended in their hues; the lowest one was black, the middle <lb/>
            white, but with a darkish tinge, the upper one shading <lb/>
            off into a ruddy colour. They were set in a rim of gold, <lb/>
            and might be said to bear resemblance to an eye†. The <lb/>
            purple of the dress was of no ordinary dye, but of the kind <lb/>
            which the Tyrians fable to have been discovered by the <lb/>
            shepherd's dog, and with which they are wont to represent <lb/>
            the robe of Venus‡ to be tinged. There was a time when <lb/>
            this purple dye was as yet unknown, but remained concealed <lb/>
            in the hollow of a little shell fish. A shepherd meeting <lb/>
            with one of these hoped to obtain the fish which was inside; <lb/>
            foiled by the hardness of the shell, after bestowing a hearty <lb/>
            curse upon his booty, he threw it into the sea as so much <lb/>
            worthless rubbish. His dog lighted upon this windfall,§ <lb/>
            and broke open the shell with his teeth, in doing which his <lb/>
            mouth and lips became stained with the brilliant dye, or <lb/>
            as we may call it, blood. The shepherd upon seeing this <lb/>
            supposed it the effect of a wound; so taking the dog down <lb/>
            to the sea he washed his mouth, upon which the imaginary <lb/>
            blood assumed a still more brilliant hue, and upon proceed­ <lb/>
            ing to touch it, his hand became of a purple colour. The <lb/>
            shepherd now guessed what was the nature of the shell fish, <lb/>
            and that it was impregnated with a dye of surpassing beauty; <lb/>
            so taking some wool he placed it in the aperture, determined <lb/>
            to dive into the mysteries of the shell; and it became of a <lb/>
            colour similar to that upon the dog's mouth. By this <note type="footnote"> * In B. v. of the Ethiopics, Heliodorus says of the Spanish and <lb/>

            means he obtained a knowledge of what we call purple; and <lb/>
            after breaking open its fortified receptacle with the help of <lb/>
            a stone, he arrived at the treasure-house of dye. To return, <lb/>
            however, to my story. My father was performing the <lb/>
            preliminary rites,* the marriage being fixed, as I have said, <lb/>
            for the following day. I was in despair, and was devising <lb/>
            some pretext for deferring it. While in this state of per­ <lb/>
            plexity, a great tumult was heard to proceed from the men's <lb/>
            quarter of the house. It appeared that as my father was <lb/>
            offering up a sacrifice; an eaglet swooping from on high <lb/>
            seized the victim, and in spite of every endeavour to scare <lb/>
            him away, bore off his prey. As this was declared to fore­ <lb/>
            bode no good, the marriage was postponed for another day. <lb/>
            My father proceeded to consult the seers and soothsayers <lb/>
            upon the meaning of the portent; they were of opinion that <lb/>
            he should offer a sacrifice to hospitable Jove at midnight <lb/>
            upon the sea-shore, since the bird had flown in that <lb/>
            direction. Sure enough he had winged his flight thither, <lb/>
            and appeared no more. For my part, I extolled the eagle <lb/>
            to the skies, and declared that he was justly styled the <lb/>
            king‡ of birds. No long time elapsed before the meaning of <lb/>
            the prodigy became revealed. There was a certain young <lb/>
            man, a native of Byzantium, by name Callisthenes; he was <lb/>
            an orphan and possessed of wealth, profligate in his life and <lb/>
            extravagant in nis expenditure, Having heard that Sostra­ <lb/>
            tus had a handsome daughter, he was anxious to obtain her <lb/>
            hand and became enamoured upon hearsay, for he had never <lb/>
            seen her.§ The force of passion upon the licentious is often <lb/>
            so strong that their ears lead them into love, and report has <lb/>
            the same effect upon their minds which sight has upon others.</p>
          <p>Before the breaking out of the war against the Byzantians, <lb/>
            the young man introduced himself to Sostratus, and asked <lb/>
            the hand of his daughter in marriage. Sostratus, however, <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">προτέλεια γάμων</foreign>. These consisted of sacrifices and offerings <lb/>
            made to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ γαήλιοι</foreign>, or divinities who presided over marriage; <lb/>

            strongly objecting to his irregular way of life, rejected his <lb/>
            application. Callisthenes was very indignant at this repulse ; <lb/>
            he considered himself slighted;—besides, he was in love, <lb/>
            and fancy pictured to his mind those charms which he had <lb/>
            never seen. Dissembling his displeasure, he meditated how <lb/>
            he might -revenge himself on Sostratus, and at the same <lb/>
            time gratify his own desires; nor was he without hope of <lb/>
            success, there being a law of the Byzautians which enacted, <lb/>
            that if any one should carry off a maiden he should be <lb/>
            exempt from punishment upon making her his wife of <lb/>
            this law he determined to avail himself, and waited only <lb/>
            till a seasonable opportunity should offer. Although the <lb/>
            war had now broken out, and the maiden had come to us <lb/>
            for security, he did not abandon his design, in the execution <lb/>
            of which the following circumstance assisted, as the Byzan­ <lb/>
            tians had received an oracle to this effect:— <lb/>
            " With plant-born name there lives an island race, <lb/>
            Whose land an isthmus to the shore doth brace; <lb/>
            Vulcan consorts there with the blue-eyed maid, <lb/>
            And there to Hercules be offerings paid." +</p>
          <p>While all were in doubt what place was intended by these <lb/>
            enigmatic words, Sostratus (who was one of the commanders) <lb/>
            thus delivered his opinion :—" We must send to Tyre, ana <lb/>
            offer up a sacrifice to Hercules ;‡ the expressions of the <lb/>
            oracle clearly point to that city. The plant-derived name,' <lb/>
            shews that the island of the Phœnicians is intended, the <lb/>
            phœnix (or palm), being a plant; both sea and land lay claim <lb/>
            to it: the latter joins it to the continent, the former washes <lb/>
            it on either side ; thus it is seated in the one element, but <lb/>
            without abandoning the other, to which it is united by its <lb/>
            narrow isthmus or neck of land; moreover, it is not founded <note type="footnote"> * Jacobs observes that this law of Byzantium is purely the invention <lb/>
            of Tatius; one resembling it existed at Athens. </note><figure type="illustration">

              in the sea, but both under it and under the isthmus, the <lb/>
              waters have free course; thus there is seen the singular <lb/>
              spectacle of a city in the sea, and of an island upon shore. <lb/>
              The mention made of ‘ Vulcan consorting with the blue. <lb/>
              eyed maid,' alludes to the olive and the fire, which are <lb/>
              found there in close proximity: for, in a sacred precinct <lb/>
              surrounded by a wall, olive trees are seen to flourisn, while <lb/>
              fire issuing from their roots burns among the branches, and <lb/>
              with its ashes benefits the tree; hence there exists a mutual <lb/>
              friendship, and Minerva shuns not Vulcan." Upon this <lb/>
              Chærophon, who shared the command with Sostratus in the <lb/>
              war, his senior in ago and a native of Tyre, extolled him <lb/>
              highly for his excellent interpretation of the oracle. " It is <lb/>
              not only fire, however," said he, " which claims our wonder; <lb/>
              the water also deserves its share. I myself have seen the <lb/>
              following marvels :-there is a fountain in Sicily whose waters <lb/>
              are mingled with fire; the flame is seen to leap up from <lb/>
              underneath, yet if you touch the water it will be found as <lb/>
              cold as snow, so that neither is the fire extinguished by the <lb/>
              water, nor the water ignited by the flame, but a mutual <lb/>
              truce subsists between the elements*. There is also a river <lb/>
              in Spain, not differing from others in appearance, but if you <lb/>
              wish to hear it become vocal, you have but to wait and <lb/>
              listen; for when a gentle breeze sweeps over its surface <lb/>
              there is heard a sound as if from strings, the wind being the <lb/>
              plectrum, the river itself the lyre.† I may likewise men­ <lb/>
              ion a lake in Lybia, resembling in its nature the Indian <lb/>
              soil.‡ The Lybian maidens are well acquainted with its <lb/>
              secrets and with the riches which, stored below its waters, <lb/>
              are mingled with the mud, for it is, in fact, a fount of gold. <lb/>
              Plunging a long pole smeared with pitch into the lake, they <lb/>
              lay open its recesses ; this pole is to the gold what the hook <lb/>
              is to the fish, serving as a bait. The grains of gold alone <note type="footnote"> * " The fire had power in the water, forgetting his own virtue; and <lb/>

          <p>After relating these marvels, Chærephon, with the consent <lb/>
            of the state, proceeded to dispatch the victims and other <lb/>
            offerings to Tyre. Callistbenes contrived to be among the <lb/>
            number of the sacred functionaries.* and soon arriving at <lb/>
            that city, he found out my father's residence, and matured <lb/>
            his schemes against the females, who, as will presently <lb/>
            be shown, went out to view the sacrificial show, which was <lb/>
            in the highest degree sumptuous ; there was a vast quantity <lb/>
            of different kinds of incense used, such as cassia, frankin­ <lb/>
            cense, and crocus ; there was also a great display of flowers, <lb/>
            the narcissus, the rose, and the myrtle; the fragrance of the <lb/>
            flowers vied with the perfumes of the incense; the breeze <lb/>
            wafted them aloft, mingled their odours in the air, producing <lb/>
            n gale of sweets. The victims were many in number and <lb/>
            of various kinds; the most remarkable among them, how­ <lb/>
            ever, were the oxen from the Nile, animals which excel <lb/>
            not only in stature but in colours. They arc altogether of <lb/>
            very large size, with brawny necks, broad backs, and ample <lb/>
            bellies ;t their horns are not depressed, like those of the <lb/>
            Sicilian ox, nor ill-shaped like the Cyprian, but project <lb/>
            upward from the forehead of this animal with a gentle <lb/>
            curve; the interval between them at their tips and at the <lb/>
            roots being equal, so that they bear a resemblance to the <lb/>
            moon when at the full; their colour is that which Homer <lb/>
            so much praises in the Thracian horses.‡ The bull stalks <lb/>
            along with lofty crest, as if to show that he is the monarch <lb/>

            My sister, therefore, and Leucippe's mother were the only <lb/>

            knew by sight the wife of Sostratus, seeing my Mister in her <lb/>
            company mistook her for Leucippe, of whom he had no <lb/>

            out making any inquiries, he points her out to a trusty <lb/>
            attendant of his, commanding him to engage some pirates <lb/>
            to effect her seizure, and arranging the manner of proceed­ <lb/>
            ing, for a high festival* was at hand when, as he under­ <lb/>
            stood, all the maidens would go down to the shore for the <lb/>
            purpose of performing their ablutions. After giving these <lb/>
            directions, and having discharged the duties of his function†, <lb/>
            he withdrew. He had previously, I may remark, provided <lb/>
            a vessel of his own, in case an opportunity should offer for <lb/>
            carrying his schemes into effect.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the rest of the sacred functionaries had em­ <lb/>
            barked and sailed away; he, however, went on board his <lb/>
            vessel, and continued to lie a little off shore, both in order <lb/>
            that lie might appear to be taking his departure like the <lb/>
            others, and also lest, being so near Tyre, any danger should <lb/>
            happen to himself in consequence of carrying off the maiden. <lb/>

            lower Zeno, who was to execute his plan. This man was <lb/>
            able-bodied, and accustomed to a buccaneering life; he <lb/>
            soon, therefore, succeeded in gathering together some pirates <lb/>
            from the above-named village, and then sailed for Tyre. <lb/>
            Near this city there is an islet with a harbour, (the Tyrians <lb/>
            call it the tomb of Rhodope); here the craft was stationed <lb/>
            watching for the prey. Before the arrival of the high <lb/>
            festival, however, which Callisthenes awaited, the omen of <lb/>
            the eagle and the interpretation of the soothsayers were <lb/>
            fulfilled. On the day preceding, we made preparations for <lb/>
            the sacrifice to Jove, and late in the evening went down to <lb/>
            the shore; none of our motions escaped Zeno, who cau­ <lb/>
            tiously followed us. When in the act of performing our <lb/>
            ablutions, he made the preconcerted signal, upon which the <figure type="illustration">

              boat made rapidly for the land, manned by ten young fel­ <lb/>
              lows; eight others were secretly in readiness on shore, <lb/>
              dressed in women'is clothes and with shaven chins; each <lb/>
              had a sword concealed under his dress, and the better to <lb/>
              avoid any suspicion, they had brought some victims with <lb/>
              them as for sacrifice, so that we took them to be women. <lb/>
              No sooner had we reached the pile than, raising a sudden <lb/>
              shout, they rushed upon us, and put out our torches; we fled <lb/>
              disorderly and in alarm, upon which they drew their swords, <lb/>
              and seizing my sister, put her into the boat, and then <lb/>
              embarking rowed off with the speed of an eagle. Some <lb/>
              who had fled at the first onset saw nothing of what after­ <lb/>
              wards occurred; others who had witnessed everything cried <lb/>
              out, " The pirates have carried off Calligone."</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the boat was far out at sea, and upon nearing <lb/>
            Sarepta made a signal which when Callisthenes recognised, <lb/>
            he put out to meet it, and taking the maiden on board his <lb/>
            own vessel, at once sailed away. I breathed again upon <lb/>
            ending my marriage thus unexpectedly broken off, never­ <lb/>
            theless I was sorry for the calamity which had befallen my <lb/>
            sister. A few days after this occurrence, I said to Leu­ <lb/>
            cippe, "How long, my dearest, are we to confine ourselves <lb/>
            to kisses ? they are pleasant enough as preludes, let us now <lb/>
            add to them something more substantial: suppose we <lb/>
            exchange mutual pledges of fidelity, for only let Venus <lb/>
            initiate. us in her mysteries and then we need fear the <lb/>
            power of no other deity."</p>
          <p>By constantly repeating my solicitations, I at length per­ <lb/>
            suaded the maiden to receive me into her own chamber, <lb/>
            Clio lending us her assistance. I will describe the situation <lb/>
            of her room : a large space in one part of the mansion con­ <lb/>
            tained two chambers on the right hand and as many on the <lb/>
            left; a narrow passage, closed at the entrance by a door, <lb/>
            gave access to them.t Those at the farther end were occu­ <lb/>
            pied by the maiden and her mother, and were opposite <lb/>
            each other; of the two remaining ones, that next to Leu­ <lb/>
            cippe belonged to Clio, the other was a store-room. Leu­ <figure type="illustration">

              cippe's mother was always in the habit of attending her to <lb/>
              bed; upon which occasions she not only locked the door <lb/>
              inside, but bad it secured by a slave on the outside, the <lb/>
              keys being handed to her through an opening; these she <lb/>
              kept until the morning, when calling the man she passed <lb/>
              them back to him that he might unlock the door.</p>
          <p>Satyrus contrived to have a set of keys made like them, <lb/>
            and finding upon trial that they would answer, he with the <lb/>
            consent of the maiden gained over Clio, who was to offer no <lb/>
            impediment. Such was the plan which we devised. There <lb/>
            was a slave belonging to the household, called Conops, a <lb/>
            prying, talkative, lecherous fellow, in short everything that <lb/>
            was bad. The man watched our proceedings very narrowly, <lb/>
            and suspecting our intentions, used to keep open the door <lb/>
            of his dormitory until late at night, so that it was no easy <lb/>
            matter to escape his observation. Satyrus wishing to make <lb/>
            a friend of him, often talked and joked with him, and <lb/>
            laughing in allusion to his name would call him <lb/>
            Gnat. The fellow seeing through the artifice of Satyrus <lb/>
            pretended to return the joke, but, in doing so, exhibited his <lb/>
            own ill-natured disposition. " As you are so fond," said <lb/>
            he, " of punning upon my name, I will tell you a story <lb/>
            about the gnat. The lion often complained to Prometheus <lb/>
            that although he had formed him a large and handsome <lb/>
            beast, had armed his jaws with teeth, and his feet with <lb/>
            claws, and had made him more powerful than the other <lb/>
            animals, still, notwithstanding all these advantages, he <lb/>
            stood in fear of the dunghill cock.- "Why dost thou <lb/>
            without cause accuse me P" replied Prometheus; " I have <lb/>
            given thee every gift which it was in my power to bestow, <lb/>
            it is thine own faint hcartedness which is in fault." The <lb/>
            lion wept and bemoaned his condition, cursing his own <lb/>
            want of courage, and in the end made up his mind to die. <lb/>
            While in this frame of mind he happened to meet the ele­ <lb/>
            phant, with whom, after wishing him good morning, he <lb/>
            entered into conversation. Seeing him continually flap his <lb/>
            ears, " What ails you," he asked—" why are your cars never <lb/>
            for a moment still ?" The elephant, about whose head a <lb/>
            gnat was at that moment flying, replied, " If the buzzing <note type="footnote"> * This fact is asserted by Ælian, B. vi. 22, and B. xiv. P. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            Insect which I see, was to get into my ear, the result would <lb/>
            be my death." Upon this the lion made the following <lb/>
            reflection. " Why should I (such as I am, and so much <lb/>
            more fortunate than the elephant,) think of dying ? It is­ <lb/>
            better to stand in awe of a cock than to dread a scurvy <lb/>
            guat."</p>
          <p>" You see," said Conops, " what power the gnat pos­ <lb/>
            sesses, since he can terrify the elephant." Satyrus who <lb/>
            saw into the malicious meaning of his words, replied with <lb/>
            a smile, " I will now relate to you the story of the gnat and <lb/>
            the lion, which I heard from a certain sage; as for your <lb/>
            tale about the elephant, you are welcome to make what you <lb/>
            can out of it. The braggart gnat said one day to the lion, <lb/>
            'So you think to lord it over me as you do over other <lb/>
            creatures. I should like to know why? You are not <lb/>
            handsomer than I am, nor yet bolder, nor yet more powerful; <lb/>
            in what respect are you superior to me ? In valour ?—You <lb/>
            tear with your claws and bite with your teeth, it is true; <lb/>
            so does every woman when she quarrels and as to your <lb/>
            size and beauty, you have indeed an ample chest and broad <lb/>
            shoulders, and a whole forest of hair about your neck, but <lb/>
            you little think how unsightly are your hinder parts. On <lb/>
            the other hand, my greatness is commensurate with the air <lb/>
            and with the power of my wings; the flowers of the meadow <lb/>
            constitute my comeliness, they serve me in lieu of garments, <lb/>
            with which, when weary with flying, I invest myself; neither <lb/>
            is my valour any laughing matter; I am the very imper­ <lb/>
            sonation of a warlike instrument; I blow a blast t when I go <lb/>
            to battle, and it is my mouth which serves for trumpet and <lb/>
            for weapon, so that I am at once, a musician and an archer; <note type="footnote"> * " Oh !" sobb'd Antonia, " I could tear their eyes out."—Byron. </note><note type="footnote"> † In case the reader wishes to understand the philosophy of the <lb/>

            moreover I am my own bow and arrow; my wings poised <lb/>
            in air shoot me forward, and lighting down, I inflict a <lb/>
            wound as with a shaft; whosoever feels it cries out and <lb/>
            forthwith tries to find his enemy: I, however, though pre­ <lb/>
            sent, am at the same time absent; I fly and I stand my <lb/>
            ground, and with my wings circle round the adversary, and <lb/>
            laugh to see him dance with pain. But why should I <lb/>
            waste more words ?—let us at once join battle.' Saying <lb/>
            this, he falls upon the lion, attacking his eyes and every <lb/>
            other part which was unprotected by hair; at the same <lb/>
            time wheeling round him and blowing his trumpet. The <lb/>
            lion was in a fury, turning himself in every direction and <lb/>
            vainly snapping at the air; his wrath afforded additional <lb/>
            sport to the gnat, who made an onslaught on his very <lb/>
            mouth. Immediately he turned to the side where he was <lb/>
            aggrieved, when his antagonist, like a skilful wrestler, twist­ <lb/>
            ing and twirling his body escaped clean through the lion's <lb/>
            teeth, which were heard to rattle against each other in the <lb/>
            vain attempt to seize him. By this time the lion was <lb/>
            thoroughly tired by thus fighting with the air, and stood <lb/>
            still, exhausted by his own efforts; upon which the gnat, <lb/>
            sailing round his mane sounded a triumphant strain of <lb/>
            victory; but stimulated by his excess of vanity he took <lb/>
            a wider range, and all at once fell into a spider's web. <lb/>
            When no hope of escape appeared, he sorrowfully said,' Fool <lb/>
            that I am, I entered the lists against a lion, and behold I <lb/>
            am caught in the meshes of a spider!' " Having finished <lb/>
            his story, Satyrus said, with a sarcastic laugh, " Be on your <lb/>
            guard, and beware of spiders." Not many days had passed <lb/>
            when Satyrus knowing what a belly-slave Conops was, pur­ <lb/>
            chased a powerful soporific draught and then invited him <lb/>
            to supper.. Suspicious of some trick, he at first declined, <lb/>
            but afterwards, over persuaded by his most excellent adviser <lb/>
            —appetite,† he complied. After supper, when he was on <lb/>
            the point of going away, Satyrus poured the potion into <note type="footnote"> * " Fallitur et multo custodis cura Lyæo ; <lb/>

              his last draught, he drank it off, and had just time to <lb/>
              reach his dormitory, when he fell on his bed in a deep sleep. <lb/>
              Upon this, Satyrus hurried to me and said, " Conops is fast <lb/>
              asleep, now is the time to prove yourself as valorous as <lb/>
              Ulysses * we instantly proceeded to the door which coni. <lb/>
              ducted to Leucippe's chamber; there he left me, and Clio <lb/>
              stealthily admitted me, trembling with joy and fear; the <lb/>
              dread of danger disturbed my hopes, but the hope of suc­ <lb/>
              cess qualified the dread, and so hope became the source of <lb/>
              fear, and pain the cause of pleasure.</p>
          <p>Just as I had entered the maiden's room, her mother's <lb/>
            sleep had been disturbed by a fearful dream; a robber <lb/>
            armed with a naked sword, seized and carried off her <lb/>
            daughter, after which, laying her upon the ground, he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to rip her up, beginning at her private parts. Terri­ <lb/>
            fled by the vision, her mother started up and hurried to her <lb/>
            daughter's apartment, which as I before said was close at <lb/>
            hand. I had but just got into bed and hearing the doors <lb/>
            open, had scarcely time to leap out before she was at her <lb/>
            daughter's side. Aware of my danger I made a bolt through <lb/>
            the opened door, and ran with all my might, till trembling <lb/>
            from head to foot I met Satyrus, when we both made our <lb/>
            way in the dark and retreated each to his own room. Leu­ <lb/>
            cippe's mother fainted, but upon recovering the first thing <lb/>
            she did was to box Clio's ears, then tearing her own hair, <lb/>
            she broke forth into lamentation. " Oh Leucippe," she <lb/>
            said, "you have blighted all my hopes. And you Sos­ <lb/>
            tratus, who are fighting at Byzantium to protect the honour <lb/>
            of other people's wives and daughters, you little think how <lb/>
            some enemy has been warring against your house, and has <lb/>
            defiled your own daughter's honour. Oh, Leucippe, I <lb/>
            never thought to see you wedded after such a fashion as <lb/>
            this ! Would that you had remained at Byzantium! Would <lb/>
            that you had suffered violence from the chances of war, and <lb/>
            that some Thracian had been your ravisher! In such a <lb/>
            case the violence would have excused the shame, whereas <note type="footnote"> * The allusion is to Ulysses preparing to put out the eye of the <lb/>
            Cyclops. </note><note type="footnote"> “the gods infused <lb/>

            now, you are at the same time wretched and disgraced. <lb/>
            The vision of the night did but mock my mind, the reali­ <lb/>
            ties of the dream were hidden from me, for of a truth, <lb/>
            yours has been a more fearful ripping up, and your wound <lb/>
            more fatal than any inflicted by the sword; and the worst <lb/>
            is, that I am ignorant who is your ravisher. I do not even <lb/>
            know what is his condition! for aught I can tell, he may <lb/>
            be some wretched slave.* ” When the maiden felt assured <lb/>
            of my escape, she took courage and said : " Mother, there <lb/>
            is no occasion for you to attack my chastity, nothing has <lb/>
            been done to me deserving of your reproaches; nor do I <lb/>
            know whether the intruder was a god, a demigod, or a mortal <lb/>
            ravisher;† all I know is that I was heartily frightened and <lb/>
            lay still, quite unable to cry out through fear; for fear, as <lb/>
            you know, acts as a padlock upon the tongue: this, however, <lb/>
            you may be assured of, no one has robbed me of my vir­ <lb/>
            ginity." Notwithstanding these assurances of her daughter, <lb/>
            Panthea gave way to a fresh paroxysm of grief. Mean­ <lb/>
            while Satyros and I were deliberating on the best course <lb/>
            to be pursued; and we determined to make our escape <lb/>
            out of the house before morning should arrive, when Clio <lb/>
            would be put to the torture and be compelled to reveal <lb/>
            everything.</p>
          <p>This plan wo at once carried into execution, and telling <lb/>
            the porter that we were going out to visit our mistresses, we <lb/>
            went straight to Clinias: it was midnight, and we had <lb/>
            some trouble in gaining admission : Clinias who slept in an <lb/>
            upper room heard our voices in discussion with his porter, <lb/>
            and hurried down in alarm, while we could see at a short <lb/>
            distance Clio running towards us, for sibe too it appeared <lb/>
            had determined to make her escape. Almost in the same <lb/>
            moment therefore Clinias heard our story, and we the nar­ <lb/>

              detailed account and stated our determination of leaving the <lb/>
              city. " I will accompany you," said Clio, " for if I remain <lb/>
              behind till morning, death (the sweetest of torments, since it <lb/>
              ends them) will be my lot." Clinias took my hand and leading <lb/>
              me aside, he said,“ It appears to me most advisable to get <lb/>
              this wench out of the way at once, and after waiting a few <lb/>
              days we can depart ourselves, if still of the same mind. <lb/>
              According to your account the maiden's mother does not <lb/>
              know who it was whom she surprised, nor will there be <lb/>
              any one to furnish evidence since Clio is removed. Nay, <lb/>
              we may perhaps persuade the maiden herself to share our <lb/>
              flight; I will accompany you at all events."</p>

            we continued to deliberate upon the course best to be pur­ <lb/>
            sued. At last we resolved to make trial of Leucippe's incli­ <lb/>
            nation, and, should she be willing, to carry her off: in case <lb/>
            of her rejecting our proposal, we determined to remain for <lb/>
            the present and to await the course of events. The short <lb/>
            remainder of the night was passed in sleep, and at daylight <lb/>
            we returned home. Panthea had no sooner risen in the <lb/>
            morning, than she had preparations made for putting Clio <lb/>
            to the torture but when summoned she could no where <lb/>
            be found. Upon this, returning to her daughter, " Will <lb/>
            you still persist,” said she,“ in concealing the particulars <lb/>
            of this pretty plot ? Now, I find that Clio also has run <lb/>
            off.” Still more reassured by the intelligence, Leucippe <lb/>
            replied, “What more would you have me tell you ? What <lb/>
            stronger testimony of the truth would you have me pro­ <lb/>
            duce ? If there is any way of proving a maid'is virginity, you <lb/>
            arc welcome to prove mine." " Aye," said Panthea, " and <lb/>
            by so doing to add to the troubles of our family by bring­ <lb/>
            ing in witnesses to its disgrace;" upon saying which, she <lb/>
            hastily quitted the apartment. Leucippe left to herself, <lb/>
            and with her mother's words still ringing in her ears, was <note type="footnote"> * The evidence of slaves was always taken with torture, and their <lb/>
            testimony was not otherwise received. For an animated picture of the <lb/>

            distracted by conflicting and various emotions ;* she was <lb/>
            deeply pained at having been discovered. Her mother's <lb/>
            reproaches filled her with shame; she felt angry at having <lb/>
            her word doubted. Now these feelings are like three bil­ <lb/>
            lows which disturb the soul's tranquillity: shame making <lb/>
            an entrance through the eyes unfits them for their natural <lb/>
            office; pain preys upon the mind and extinguishes its <lb/>
            ardour; while the voice of anger baying round the heart <lb/>
            overpowers reason with its wrathful foam.† The tongue is <lb/>
            the parent of these different feelings ; bending its bow and <lb/>
            aiming its arrow at the mark, it inflicts its several wounds <lb/>
            upon the soul with the wordy shaft of railing it produces <lb/>
            anger, with that of well founded accusation, begets pain, <lb/>
            with that of reproof, causes shame; the peculiarity of all <lb/>
            these arrows is, that they inflict deep but bloodless wounds, <lb/>
            and there is available against their effects one remedy <lb/>
            alone, which is, to turn against tho assailant his own wea­ <lb/>
            pons. Speech, the weapon of the tongue, must be repelled <lb/>
            by a weapon of like nature, for then the feeling of anger <lb/>
            will become calmed and the sensations of shamo and an­ <lb/>
            noyance will be appeased; but if dread of a superior hinder <lb/>
            the employment of such succours, the very fact of silence <lb/>
            makes these wounds to rankle the more deeply, and unless <lb/>
            these mental waves, raised by the power of speech, can cast <lb/>
            up their foam, they will but swell and toss the more.§</p>
          <p>What I have been saying will picture the condition of <lb/>
            Leucippe's mind, who felt ready to sink under her troubles; <lb/>

              Satyrus to her, in order to make overtures of flight. Antici­ <lb/>
              pating him in her words, she exclaimed:—“In the name of the <lb/>

              power, and take me whither you will; for if you go away <lb/>
              and leave me here, the noose suspended by my own hands <lb/>
              shall be my death." When I was informed of her expres­ <lb/>
              sions, it freed me from a world of anxiety; and in the course <lb/>
              of two or three days, when my father was absent from home, <lb/>
              we made preparations for our flight. use had still re­ <lb/>
              maining some of the potion which he had used so success­ <lb/>
              fully upon Conops. While waiting at supper he poured <lb/>
              out a little into the last cup, which he presented to Panthea; <lb/>
              almost immediately after drinking it, she retired to her own <lb/>
              room, and fell fast asleep. Leucippe had now another <lb/>
              chambermaid, with whom Satyrus was on familiar terms; <lb/>
              having given her likewise a portion of the draught, he pro­ <lb/>
              ceeded to a third party, the porter, who was soon lying <lb/>
              under the influence of the same soporific potion.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Clinias was awaiting us at the door with a <lb/>
            carriage which he bad in readiness, and while all were yet <lb/>
            asleep, between nine and ten at night, we cautiously left <lb/>
            the house, Satyrus leading Leucippe by the hand: Conops, <lb/>
            as I may remark, who used to watch our movements, being <lb/>
            fortunately absent, having been dispatched on an errand by <lb/>
            his mistress. On getting out, we immediately entered the <lb/>
            carriage, six in number, Leucippe, I and Satyrus, together <lb/>
            with Clinias and two servants. We drove off in the direc­ <lb/>
            tion of Sidon, where we arrived about midnight, and with­ <lb/>
            out delay continued our journey to Berytus, in hopes of <lb/>
            finding some vessel in the harbour; nor were we disap­ <lb/>
            pointed, for on going to the port we found a ship on the <lb/>
            point of sailing: out even inquiring whither she was <lb/>
            bound, we got our baggage on board, and embarked a little <lb/>
            before dawn. It was then wo learnt that the vessel was <lb/>
            bound for the celebrated city of Alexandria, situated on the <lb/>
            Nile.</p>
          <p>The sight of the sea delighted me while as yet we were <lb/>
            in the smooth water of the harbour; soon, however, upon <lb/>
            the wind becoming favourable, loud tumult prevailed <lb/>
            throughout the vessel; the sailors hurried to and fro, the <lb/>
            master issued his commands, ropes were bent, the sail-yard <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            was brought round before the wind, the sail was unfurled, <lb/>
            we weighed anchor,* the ship began to move, the port was <lb/>
            left behind, and the coast, as if itself in motion, seemed <lb/>
            gradually to be retiring from us ;t the Pæan was chanted, <lb/>
            and many prayers were addressed to the guardian deities <lb/>
            for a prosperous voyage. Meanwhile the wind freshened <lb/>
            and filled the sail, and the vessel speeded on her course.</p>
          <p>There was a young man on board, in the same cabin‡ <lb/>
            with ourselves, when dinner time was come he politely <lb/>
            invited us to partake of his meal. Satyrus was just then <lb/>
            bringing out our provisions; so putting all into a common <lb/>
            stock, we shared our dinner and our conversation. I began <lb/>
            by saying, " Pray where do you come from, and by what <lb/>
            name are we to address you ?" " My name," he replied, <lb/>
            “ is Menelaus, and I am a native of Ægypt; and now may <lb/>
            I inquire who you are ?" " I am called Clitopho, and my <lb/>
            companion Clinias; our country is Phœnicia.” " And <lb/>
            what," he rejoined, "is the motive of your voyage?” " If <lb/>
            you will relate your own story first, you shall then hear <lb/>
            ours." Menelaus assented, and began as follows:­ <lb/>

              of the chase. I did everything in my power to restrain him <lb/>
              from this pursuit, but without success. Finding I could <lb/>
              not prevail with him, I myself accompanied him.</p>
          <p>“ One day we were out hunting, and for a time every. <lb/>
            thing went on successfully so long as harmless animals <lb/>
            were alone the objects of our sport. At length a wild boar <lb/>
            was roused; the youth pursued the brute, who faced about, <lb/>
            and ran furiously to attack him; still the youth kept his <lb/>
            ground, notwithstanding that I repeatedly called out:­ <lb/>
            ' Wheel round your horse; the beast is too powerful for <lb/>
            you.' The boar continuing its career, and coming up, they <lb/>
            closed in combat. Terrified lest the beast should wound <lb/>
            the horse, and so bring down his rider, I launched my javelin <lb/>
            without taking sufficient aim, and the youth crossing its <lb/>
            course, received the stroke..</p>
          <p>" Picture to yourself the feelings of my mind. If I <lb/>
            retained life at that moment, it was like a living death ; and <lb/>
            whnt was most lamentable of all, the wretched youth, who <lb/>
            still breathed, extending his arms, embraced me, and so far <lb/>
            from hating his destroyer, he expired still grasping my <lb/>
            homicidal hand. On account of this lamentable occur­ <lb/>
            rence his parents took legal proceedings against me; nor <lb/>
            was I unwilling to stand my trial; indeed I offered no <lb/>
            defence, considering myself fully deserving to suffer death. <lb/>
            The judge, out of compassion, condemned me to three years' <lb/>
            banishment, and that period having now expired, I am on <lb/>
            my return home.”</p>
          <p>This narrative reminded Clinias of the unhappy death of <lb/>
            Charicles, and he shed tears, which though in appearance <lb/>
            they flowed for another's grief, were, in reality, drawn forth <lb/>
            by his own sorrows.† " Are you weeping on my account," <note type="footnote"> * Tatius appears to have had In his mind the story of the death <lb/>

            asked Menelaus, “ or has any similar disaster befallen you ?” <lb/>
            Upon this Clinias, with many sighs, detailed the circum­ <lb/>
            stances of Charicles and the horse; and I likewise related <lb/>
            my adventures. Seeing Menelaus very low spirited on <lb/>
            account of his own thoughts, and Clinias still shedding <lb/>
            tears at the recollection of Charicles, I endeavoured to dis­ <lb/>
            sipate their grief, by introducing a love topic for conver­ <lb/>
            sation ; for Leucippe, I may observe, was not then present, <lb/>
            but was asleep in the ship's hold. I began, therefore, <lb/>
            with a smiling air:—“ How much better off is Clinias than <lb/>
            I am; be was no doubt longing to inveigh against women, <lb/>
            according to his wont, and he can do so all the better now, <lb/>
            having found one who sympathises with his tastes; but why <lb/>
            so many should be addicted to the love of youths, for my <lb/>
            part I cannot tell."</p>
          <p>" There can be no doubt," said Menelaus, " which is pre­ <lb/>
            ferable. Youths are much more open and free from affec­ <lb/>
            tation than women, and their beauty stimulates the senses <lb/>
            much more powerfully."</p>
          <p>"How so?" I asked; "it no sooner appears than it is <lb/>
            gone. It affords no enjoyment to the lover, but is like the <lb/>
            cup of Tantalus, while one is drinking the liquid disappears; <lb/>
            and even the little which has been swallowed is unsatisfying. <lb/>
            No one can leave such favourites without feeling his plea­ <lb/>
            sure alloyed with pain, the draught of love still leaves him <lb/>
            thirsty.”</p>
          <p>" You do not understand," rejoined Menelaus, " that the <lb/>
            perfection of pleasure consists in its bringing with it no <lb/>
            satiety; the very fact of its being of a permanent and satis- <lb/>
            (fying kind takes away from its delight. What we snatch <lb/>
            but now and then is always new, and always in full beauty. <lb/>
            Of such things the pleasure is not liable to decay and age, <lb/>
            and it gains in intensity what it loses by briefness of <lb/>
            duration; for this reason, the rose is considered the most <lb/>
            lovely among flowers, because its beauty so quickly fades. <lb/>
            There are two species of beauty among mortals, each <lb/>
            bestowed by its presiding goddess ;* the one is of heaven, <note type="footnote"> * Tatius alludes to Venus Urania and Venus Popularis, the one the <lb/>
            patroness of pure, the other of impure, love. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            the other of earth; the former chafes at being linked to <lb/>
            what is mortal, and quickly wings its flight to heaven; the <lb/>
            latter clings to earth, and cleaves to mortal bodies. Would <lb/>
            you have a poet's testimony of the ascent of heavenly <lb/>
            beauty ? hear what Homer sings <lb/>
            Ganymede, <lb/>
            Fairest of human kind, whom for that cause <lb/>
            The gods caught up to beav'n that he might dwell <lb/>
            For ever there, the cup-bearer of Jove.* <lb/>
            But no woman, I trow, ever ascended to heaven for her <lb/>
            beauty's sake, though Jove had abundance of intrigues <lb/>
            with women: grief and exile were the portion of Alcmena; <lb/>
            the chest and the sea were the receptacle of Danae; and <lb/>
            Semele became food for fire ;t but-mark the difference-­ <lb/>
            when Jove became enamoured of a Phrygian youth, he took <lb/>
            him up to heaven to dwell with him, and pour out his <lb/>
            nectar, depriving his predecessor of the office, she being, I <lb/>
            rather think, a woman."</p>
          <p>" In my opinion," said I, interrupting him, " female <lb/>
            beauty has in it much more of the heavenly kind, because <lb/>
            it does not so quickly fade; and the freer from decay, the <lb/>
            nearer is anything to the divine nature. On the other <lb/>
            hand, whatsoever in accordance with its mortal nature soon <lb/>
            decays, is not of heaven, but of earth. I grant that Jove, <lb/>
            enamoured of a Phrygian youth, raised him to the skies, <lb/>
            but the beauty of woman brought him down from heaven; f'or <lb/>
            a woman he bellowed under the form of a bull, for a woman <lb/>
            he danced as a satyr, for a woman he transformed himself <lb/>
            into a golden shower. Let Ganymede, therefore, be Jove'a <lb/>
            cup-bearer, if you will, provided that Juno ‡ also reclines at <lb/>
            the banquet, and has a youth to wait on her. For my part, <lb/>
            I cannot think upon his rape without feelings of pity: a <lb/>
            savage bird is sent down, he is seized and borne aloft (cruel <lb/>
            and tyrannous treatment, methinks), and the unseemly <lb/>
            spectacle is seen of a youth suspended from an eagle's <lb/>
            talons. No ravenous bird of prey, but the element of fire, <lb/>
            bore Semele aloft; nor should there seem anything strange <lb/>
            and unnatural in this, since it was by the same means that <note type="footnote"> * Iliad xx. 2, 3, 4. </note><note type="footnote"> † See Anthon's Lempriere for the legends attached to their names. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Göttling proposes to read " Hebe," which suits the context better. </note> <lb/>

            Hercules went up to heaven. You amuse yourself at the <lb/>
            expense of Danae's chest, but why do you pass over Per­ <lb/>
            seus, who shared her fate ? For Alcmena it sufficed that <lb/>
            Jove for love of her robbed the world of three whole <lb/>
            days.*</p>
          <p>" Passing, however, from the legends of mythology, I will <lb/>
            speak of the real delights of love, though my experience in <lb/>
            such matters has been small, compared with that of others, <lb/>
            and confined to females who sell their charms for lucre. <lb/>
            In the first place, how tender and yielding is a woman's body <lb/>
            to the touch, how soft are her lips when kissed ; her person <lb/>
            is in every way fitted for the amorous embrace: he who is <lb/>

            are impressed upon his lips as seals upon a letter, and she <lb/>
            kisses with such studied art as imbues the kiss with double <lb/>
            sweetness. Not content to use her lips, she brings her teeth <lb/>
            also into play, and feeding upon her lover's mouth, makes <lb/>
            her very kisses bite. What pleasure also is there in the <lb/>
            sensation of pressing a woman's breast, while in the amorous <lb/>
            crisis, so powerful is her excitement, that the is actually <lb/>
            maddened with delight. Her kisses are not confined to the <lb/>
            lips, but lovers' tongues even do their endeavour to kiss <lb/>
            each other. At the conclusion of the amorous combat, she <lb/>
            pants, overcome with the fiery delight, and her love-sick breath <lb/>
            finding its way to her lips, encounter the lover's kiss still <lb/>
            wandering there, and mingling with it both descend and <lb/>
            exert their electric influence upon her heart, which leaps <lb/>
            and beats, and were it not fast bound within, would desert <lb/>
            its seat, and be drawn forth by the strength of kisses."t</p>

          <p>ON the third day of our voyage a sudden change took <lb/>
            place in the weather; the sky, which had been clear, grew <lb/>
            so black as quite to obscure the light of day, and a violent <lb/>
            gale ploughing up the sea blew directly in our teeth. Upon <lb/>
            this, the master ordered the yard to be brought round;‡ <note type="footnote">* “ Sed quæ mutatis inducitur, atque fovetur <lb/>

            antenna or yard, the use of which was to turn it round as the wind <lb/>
            veered, so as to keep the sail opposite the wind. See a cut at p. 52 of <lb/>
            the Greek and Rom. Antiq. </note> <lb/>

            the sailors speedily obeyed, furling one-half of the sail by <lb/>
            dint of great exertions, but were compelled by the violence <lb/>
            of the wind to leave the other unfurled. In consequence of <lb/>
            this manœuvre one side of the vessel began to heel, while the <lb/>
            contrary side became proportionally elevated, so that we <lb/>
            every moment expected to be capsized, as the gale continued <lb/>
            to blow with undiminished fury. To prevent this, and to <lb/>
            restore, if possible, the vessel’s equilibrium, we all scrambled <lb/>
            to the side highest out of water, but it was of no avail. <lb/>
            We ourselves, indeed, were raised, but the position of the <lb/>
            ship was in no way altered; after long and vain endeavours <lb/>
            to right her, the wind suddenly shifted, almost submerging <lb/>
            the side which had been elevated, and raising high out of <lb/>
            the water that previously depressed. An universal shriek <lb/>
            arose from those on board, and nothing remained but to <lb/>
            hurry back to our former station. We repeated this several <lb/>
            times, our movements keeping pace with the shifting of the <lb/>
            vessel; indeed, we had scarcely succeeded in hurrying to <lb/>
            one side, before we were obliged to hurry back in the con­ <lb/>
            trary direction. Like those who run backwards and forwards <lb/>
            in the course,. we continued these alternate movements <lb/>
            during a great part of the day, momentarily expecting death, <lb/>
            who, as it seemed, was not far off; for about noon the sun <lb/>
            entirely disappeared, and we saw each other as if by moon­ <lb/>
            light ; lightnings flashed from the clouds, the thunder rolled, <lb/>
            filling the sky with its echoes, which were repeated from <lb/>
            below by the strife of waters, while in the intermediate <lb/>
            space was heard the shouts of the discordant winds,! so <lb/>
            that the air seemed one mighty trumpet; the ropes break­ <lb/>

            at last they were rent in pieces. We now began to be in <lb/>
            no small fear that the vessel, from the shattered condition of <lb/>
            her sides, would open and go to pieces; the bulwarks. too <lb/>
            were flooded, being continually washed over by the waves. <lb/>
            We however crawled under them for protection, and abandon­ <lb/>
            log all hope resigned ourselves to Fortune. Tremendous <lb/>
            billows following in quick succession tumbled one over the <lb/>
            other, some in front, some at the sides of the ship, which as <lb/>
            they approached was lifted high up as if upon a mountain, <lb/>
            and when they retired was plunged down as into an abyss.t <lb/>
            The most formidable were those which broke against the <lb/>
            sides and made their way over the bulwarks, flooding all the <lb/>
            vessel; even while approaching from a distance these were <lb/>
            formidable enough, almost touching, as they did, the clouds; <lb/>
            but when they neared and broke, you would have supposed <lb/>
            that the ship must inevitably be swallowed up. We could <lb/>
            scarcely keep our feet, so violent was the rolling of the <lb/>
            vessel, and a confused din of sounds was heard ;-the sea <lb/>
            roared, the wind blustered, the women shrieked, the men <lb/>
            shouted, the sailors called to one another: all was wailing <lb/>
            and lamentation.‡</p>
          <p>At length the master ordered the cargo to be thrown <lb/>
            overboard; no distinction was made between gold and silver, <lb/>
            and the commonest articles,-all were pitched over the sides; <lb/>
            many of the merchants with their own hands tumbling into <lb/>
            the sea the goods on which all their hopes were centred. <lb/>
            By these means the ship was lightened, but the storm did <lb/>
            not in any degree abate. At length the master, wearied <lb/>
            out and in despair, let go the tiller, abandoned the ship to the <lb/>
            waves, and standing at the gangway ordered the boats to be <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>* <foreign xml:lang="grc">γίῤῤα</foreign> ; these appear to mean the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραῤῤύματτ</foreign>, made of skins and <lb/>

            got ready and the sailors to embark. Upon this a fearful <lb/>
            scene of strife arose; the sailors in the boat were beginning <lb/>
            to cut the rope which attached it to the ship. Seeing this, <lb/>
            the passengers endeavoured to leap in, which the crew would <lb/>
            not allow, threatening with their swords and axes any who <lb/>
            should venture on the attempt. The others upon this arm­ <lb/>
            ing themselves as best they could with shattered oars and <lb/>
            broken benches, showed a determination to retaliate, for in <lb/>
            a storm might, not right, must settle matters. A novel <lb/>
            kind of sea-fight now commenced; they in the boat, fearful <lb/>
            of being swamped by the numbers who were descending <lb/>
            from the vessel, laid about them in good earnest with their <lb/>
            swords and axes; which the passengers as they leaped in <lb/>
            were not backward in returning with their poles and oars, <lb/>
            and some scarcely touched the boat before they fell into the <lb/>
            water; others, who had succeeded in getting in, were strug­ <lb/>
            gling with the sailors to maintain their ground. The laws <lb/>
            of friendship or neighbourly regard were no longer heeded; <lb/>
            each looked to his own preservation, careless of the safety <lb/>
            of any other; for the effect of pressing danger is, that it <lb/>
            dissolves even the tenderest ties. One of the passengers, a <lb/>
            robust young fellow, succeeded at last in getting hold of the <lb/>
            rope and dragging the boat towards the vessel; every <lb/>
            one on board holding himself ready to leap in. A few <lb/>
            succeeded in the endeavour, though not without receiving <lb/>
            injuries; many in their attempt were plunged into the sea. <lb/>
            The crew without further delay, cutting the rope with their <lb/>
            axes, put off, and committed themselves to the mercy of the <lb/>
            winds; those on board in the meantime having used every <lb/>
            exertion to sink the boat. The vessel, after continuing for <lb/>
            some time to pitch and roll upon the waves, was carried <lb/>
            upon a sunken rock, when she struck and soon went to <lb/>
            pieces, the mast falling over on one side and hastening her <lb/>
            destruction. They who were at once swallowed up in the <lb/>
            briny waves experienced a happier lot than their companions, <lb/>
            in not having to remain with death before their eyes ; for at <lb/>
            sea the anticipation of drowning kills even before death <lb/>
            actually arrives; the eye, bewildered by the expanse of <lb/>
            waters, can set no limits to its fears: this it is which <lb/>
            gives death so much more bitterness. and makes it re. <lb/>

            garded with dread proportioned to the vasty nature of the <lb/>
            sea itself.*</p>
          <p>Upon the present occasion some were dashed against <lb/>
            rocks and perished, others were pierced by pieces of broken <lb/>
            spars, and some were seen swimming in a half-exhausted <lb/>
            state. When the vessel was wrecked, some good genius <lb/>
            preserved a portion of the prow, upon which I and Leucippe <lb/>
            being seated, were carried along by the current; Menelaus, <lb/>
            Satyrus, and some other passengers, had thrown themselves <lb/>
            across the mast; Clinias at no great distance was swimming <lb/>
            supported by the yard, and we could hear him calling out, <lb/>
            “Hold on, Clitopho !” In a moment a wavo washed over <lb/>
            him; at which sad spectacle we shrieked aloud. Rolling <lb/>
            onward in our direction, it happily passed us, and we again <lb/>
            caught sight of the yard, and Clinias riding upon its crest. <lb/>
            “ 0, mighty Neptune," exclaimed I, with a deep groan, <lb/>
            “ take pity on us, and spare the remnants of this shipwreck; <lb/>
            our terror has caused us already to die many deaths; if it <lb/>
            be thy will to destroy us, do not divide us in our deaths; let <lb/>
            one wave overwhelm us; or if we are fated to become food <lb/>
            for the monsters of the deep let one devour us;—let us have <lb/>
            one common death, one common tomb." I had not long <lb/>
            uttered this prayer before the violence of the wind abated <lb/>
            and the roughness of the waves subsided, and the surface of <lb/>
            the sea was seen covered with floating bodies. Menelaus <lb/>
            and his companions were thrown by the waves upon a part <lb/>
            of the coast of Egypt which was at that time the general <lb/>
            haunt of buccaneers. Late in the evening, Leucippe and I <lb/>
            contrived to reach Pelusium, and upon getting to land <lb/>
            thanked the gods for our escape; nor did we omit bewailing <lb/>
            Clinias and Satyrus, believing them to have been drowned. <note type="footnote"> * “ ) Lord ! methought what pain it was to drown I <lb/>

            In the temple of Casian* Jupiter, at Pelusium, there is <lb/>
            the statue of a youth very like Apollo ; his hand is stretched <lb/>
            out and holds a pomegranate, which has a mystic meaning.† <lb/>
            After praying to this deity, and asking tidings of Clinias <lb/>
            and Satyrus (for the god is believed to be prophetic) we <lb/>
            walked about the temple; in the treasury‡ at the rear ot <lb/>
            this edifice we saw two pictures by the artist Evanthes. <lb/>
            The subject of one was Andromeda, of the other, Prome­ <lb/>
            theus. Both were represented as bound, for which reason <lb/>
            probably the painter had associated them together. They <lb/>
            furnished other points of resemblance also; both had a <lb/>
            rock for their prison house, and savage beasts for their <lb/>
            executioners, the one being a bird of prey, the other a sea <lb/>
            monster. The champions also who came to their rescue <lb/>
            were both Grecians, Hercules and Perseus. The former is <lb/>
            represented standing on the ground and aiming his arrow <lb/>
            at the bird of Jove; the latter poised in air directs his <lb/>
            attack against the fish. The rock is hollowed out, so as to <lb/>
            suit the size of the maiden’s body, and the rugged surface <lb/>
            given it by the painter, plainly showed that it is intended <lb/>
            to represent a production of nature, not the work of art; <lb/>
            the maiden is fixed in the hollow of this rock, her lovely <lb/>
            form giving her the appearance of a wondrously-carved <lb/>
            statue,§ but the chains and the sea-monster betokening a <lb/>
            hastily-planned tomb.|| Beauty and fear are mingled in <lb/>
            her countenance, yet the pallor of her cheeks is not wholly <lb/>
            untinged with colour, while the brightness of her eyes is <lb/>
            tempered by a languor such as is seen in violets when they <lb/>
            begin to fade; thus had the painter imparted to her the <lb/>
            expression of comely fear.¶ Her arms, extended on either <lb/>
            side, are chained against the rock, the wrists and fingers <lb/>
            hanging down like the clusters from the vine; her arms are <lb/>

              upon his head; in his left hand he grasps the Gorgon's <lb/>
              head, holding it forth in the manner of a shield ; the face is <lb/>
              fearful to behold, and even on the painter's canvas seems to <lb/>

              escape was impossible; so the master exclaiming, “We are <lb/>

            of Egyptian buccaneers, cutting us off from any chance of <lb/>
            pity. Our voice and our entreaties might mollify the <lb/>
            heart of a Grecian pirate ; for words oftentimes beget com­ <lb/>
            passion, and the tongue ministering to the necessities of <lb/>
            the soul, subdues the angry feeling of the hearer; but in <lb/>
            our present case, what language can we employ, what oaths <lb/>
            -if submission can we take ? Had I tones more persuasive <lb/>
            than the Syrens', these barbarian homicides would neither <lb/>

              how sufficiently weep for thine, Leucippe, thou who hast <lb/>
              shown thyself so faithful in all the straits of love, so tender <lb/>
              towards thy unhappy lover! Behold, the splendid pre­ <lb/>

              earth for thy couch, the noose and the rope for thy neck­ <lb/>
              laces and bracelets, a pirate for thy bridesman,* a dirge for <lb/>
              thy nuptial hymn. “ O Sea! I have thanked thee without <lb/>
              reason; rather should I upbraid thee for thy mercy; greater <lb/>
              in reality has been thy kindness to those whom thou hast <lb/>
              drowned; our preservation deserves rather to be called destruc­ <lb/>
              tion, for thou hast grudged us death except by the bands of <lb/>
              buccaneers." In this manner did I inwardly lament, but <lb/>
              no tears came to my relief; this is indeed peculiar to the <lb/>
              eyes in all great misfortunes; in the season of any ordinary <lb/>
              grief, they flow readily enough,† and then they not only <lb/>
              serve as intercessors between the sufferer and the cause of <lb/>
              his sufferings, but they also diminish the inward swelling of <lb/>
              the heart; but in the time of excessive sorrow, tears take <lb/>
              to flight and are traitors to the eyes; sorrow encounters <lb/>
              them as they are springing from their fountain, arrests <lb/>
              their progress and compels them to retrace their way; <lb/>
              accordingly, turned from the direction of the eyes they flow <lb/>
              back upon the soul and exasperate its inward wounds.</p>
          <p>Turning to Leucippe, who had not spoken a word, I <lb/>
            said, " Why are you silent, dearest? Why do you not speak <lb/>
            to me ?" " Because," she replied, " though my soul still lives, <lb/>
            my voice is already dead." The dawn imperceptibly over­ <lb/>
            took us while we were engaged in conversation, when <lb/>
            a horseman suddenly rode up with a profusion of long <lb/>
            matted hair;‡ his horse was as shaggy as himself and bare­ <lb/>

              their captain, with orders to bring away any maiden whom <lb/>
              he might find to be an expiatory offering on behalf of the <lb/>
              pirates, to their god. The guards immediately seized Leu­ <lb/>
              cippe, who clung to me with shrieks, but while some of <lb/>
              them struck me, others tore her away, placed her on horse­ <lb/>
              back and rode away, leaving us who were still bound to <lb/>
              follow at greater leisure. We had scarcely proceeded two <lb/>
              furlongs from the village when we heard a loud shouting <lb/>
              mingled with the sounds of a trumpet, and presently a body <lb/>
              of heavy armed soldiers appeared in view, upon which the <lb/>
              pirates, placing us in the centre, stood their ground and <lb/>
              prepared for resistance. The soldiers were about fifty in <lb/>
              number, some bearing long shields reaching to the feet, <lb/>
              others having only bucklers. The buccaneers, who were far <lb/>
              superior in numbers, began to pelt the military with clods <lb/>
              of earth :∗ now, an Egyptian clod can do more execution <lb/>
              than any other, for being of stony earth, it is at the same <lb/>
              time heavy, rough, and jagged, can raise a swelling and <lb/>
              inflict a wound. The soldiers relying upon the protection <lb/>
              of their shields cared little for these missiles, and waiting <lb/>
              till the buccaneers were tired with their exertions, they <lb/>
              suddenly opened their ranks, when the light-armed darted <lb/>
              out, each armed with a javelin and a sword, and so skilful <lb/>
              was the aim that no one missed his mark ; the heavy-armed <lb/>
              proceeded to support them and a stubborn fight took place, <lb/>
              in which abundance of blows and wounds were exchanged <lb/>
              on either side. Military discipline made up for deficiency <lb/>
              of numbers, the pirates began to give ground, which, when <lb/>
              we observed, I and the other prisoners bursting through <lb/>
              their ranks went over to the enemy; ignorant of our real <lb/>
              condition the soldiers were about to kill us, when per­ <lb/>
              ceiving us to be naked and bound with cords, they received <lb/>
              us into their ranks and sent us fcr safety to the rear; <lb/>
              meanwhile a body of cavalry came up and extending their <lb/>
              flanks they surrounded the buccaneers, got them into a nar­ <lb/>
              row space and cut them down; the greater part were soon <lb/>
              dispatched, some though severely wounded still resisted, the <lb/>

              commander of the forces, Oharmides by name, interrogated <lb/>
              us severally, asking who we were, and how we had been <lb/>
              captured. The others told their stories and I related my <lb/>
              own adventures; after hearing every particular he desired us <lb/>
              to follow him, promising to supply us with arms; it being <lb/>
              his intention, as soon as the rest of his troops came up, to <lb/>
              attack the chief haunt of the pirates, where it was said there <lb/>
              were ten thousand men. Being a good rider I requested <lb/>
              the favour of a horse, and no sooner was my wish complied <lb/>
              with, than mounting I went through the different evolu­ <lb/>
              tions of a cavalry soldier, to the great delight of the com­ <lb/>
              mander. He insisted on having me as a guest at his own <lb/>
              table, and after hearing my history at supper time, expressed <lb/>
              his commiseration of my misfortunes.</p>
          <p>The listening to others' grief oftentimes begets sympathy <lb/>
            in the hearers, and this sympathy leads to friendship, the <lb/>
            soul affected by the relation of woe, passing from feelings <lb/>
            of pity to sensations of a tenderer kind.∗ Charmides, at any <lb/>
            rate, was so much moved, that he could not refrain from <lb/>
            tears; more than this he could not do, as Leucippe was in <lb/>
            the power of the pirates. I may also mention that he <lb/>
            kindly gave me an Egyptian as my servant. The next day <lb/>
            he prepared to advance against the buccaneers, who were <lb/>
            seen in great force on the other side of a trench which it <lb/>
            was his object to fill up. They had constructed a rude <lb/>
            altar of earth, and near it lay a coffin; two men were seen <lb/>
            conducting the maiden, whose hands were bound behind her <lb/>
            back.</p>
          <p>I could not distinguish who they were, because their <lb/>
            armour concealed them, but I easily recognized Leucippe. <lb/>
            After pouring a libation upon her head, they led her round <lb/>
            the altar, an Egyptian priest all the while chanting a <lb/>
            hymn as was evident from the motion of his lips and the <note type="footnote"> ∗ “I did consent, <lb/>

            being given retired to a considerable distance, when one of <lb/>
            the young men who had conducted the maiden placed her <lb/>
            upon the ground, bound her to four wooden pegs-just as <lb/>
            image makers represent Marsyas bound to the tree-and <lb/>
            then drawing a sword plunged it into her heart, and drawing <lb/>
            the weapon downwards laid open all her belly so that the <lb/>
            intestines immediately protruded; then they removed and <lb/>
            laid them upon the altar, and when roasted they were cut <lb/>
            into portions and partaken of by the pirates. The sol­ <lb/>
            diers and their commander upon witnessing these proceed­ <lb/>
            ings cried out and averted their faces in disgust; strange <lb/>
            to say, I continued to gaze in stupid astonishment, as if <lb/>
            thunderstruck by the surpassing horror of the spectacle. <lb/>
            There may really have been some truth in the legend of <lb/>
            Niobe, and from being affected by the loss of her children, <lb/>
            in the same way in which I was now, her motionless ap­ <lb/>
            pearance may have given her the appearance of being turned <lb/>
            to stone. When the horrible business was, as I supposed <lb/>
            ended, the young men placed the body in the coffin, covering <lb/>
            it with a lid, and after throwing down the altar, hurried <lb/>
            back to their companions, not once looking behind them, <lb/>
            for such had been the injunction of the priest.</p>
          <p>By evening the trench was filled up and the soldiers <lb/>
            after crossing it, encamped for the night and prepared their <lb/>
            supper. Charmides seeing my distress, did all in his power <lb/>
            to console me, but to no purpose; for about the first watch <lb/>
            of the night, when all were asleep, I took my sword, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to the spot and prepared to stab myself upon the <lb/>
            coffin.—“Wretched Leucippe," I exclaimed, " thou most <lb/>

            up while yet alive, and able to gaze upon the horrid process <lb/>
            -that thou hast had an accursed altar and coffin for thy <lb/>
            joint grave, the former for thy bowels, the latter for thy <lb/>
            oody. Had the fire consumed thy entrails, there would <lb/>
            be less cause to grieve; but now, most horrible, they have <lb/>
            been made to furnish forth food to a pirate band! 0 <lb/>
            accursed altar-torch, 0 unheard of banquet! and yet the <lb/>
            gods looked quietly down upon such proceedings,. and <lb/>
            yet the fire was not extinguished, but polluted as it was <lb/>
            sent up its odour with acceptance to the deities! Leucippe, <lb/>
            thou shalt now receive from me the offering which bents <lb/>
            thee." After uttering these words, I raised the sword and <lb/>
            was oil the point of stabbing myself, when by the light of <lb/>
            the moon I perceived two men hastily running towards me; <lb/>
            supposing them to be buccaneers, I paused in the ex­ <lb/>
            pectation of being put to death by them ; they soon reached <lb/>
            the spot where I was standing and both called aloud to me, <lb/>
            and who should they prove to be, but Satyrus and Mene­ <lb/>
            laus. So profound was my grief at what had taken place, <lb/>
            that though I saw before me two of my friends unex­ <lb/>
            pectedly alive and well, I neither embraced them nor felt <lb/>
            any emotion of joy.</p>
          <p>Seizing my hand they endeavoured to wrest the sword <lb/>
            from me. “ In the name of the gods," said I, “ grudge me <lb/>
            not a welcome death, or rather, I should say, a medicine for <lb/>
            all my ills. Do what you please; I will no longer remain in <lb/>
            life, now that Leucippe is gone. You may indeed deprive <lb/>
            me of this weapon, but there will remain a sword of grief <lb/>
            within which slowly kills and drinks my blood; do you <lb/>
            wish that I should die by this slow and lingering death ? <lb/>
            Upon this, interrupting me, Menelaus said, " If this be <lb/>
            your only reason for dying, you may put up your sword; <lb/>
            Leucippe shall soon come to life again." I looked stead­ <lb/>
            fastly at him, and exclaimed, " Can you insult me in the <lb/>
            midst of such calamities (-have some regard for hospitable <lb/>
            Jove." Without farther delay he tapped upon the coffin <note type="footnote"> * " . . . . . Magne reguator Deûm. <lb/>

            several times, calling out, "Leucippe, since Clitopho is incre­ <lb/>
            dulous, do you bear witness to the truth of what I say;" and <lb/>
            almost immediately a faint voice was heard proceeding from <lb/>
            the interior. A sudden trembling seized me, and I gazed <lb/>
            upon Menelaus, half believing him to be a sorcerer; he <lb/>
            proceeded to remove the lid, when Leucippe slowly rose <lb/>
            and came forth, presenting the most fearful spectacle <lb/>
            which can be imagined; the lower part of her person was <lb/>
            entirely laid open and all her bowels had been removed; we <lb/>
            rushed into each other's embrace and both fell to the ground. <lb/>
            When I had recovered myself a little, I said to Menelaus, <lb/>
            " Will you not explain the meaning of all this ? Is not <lb/>
            this Leucippe whose face I behold, whose form I press, and <lb/>
            whose voice I hear ? What was it which I witnessed yester­ <lb/>
            day ? Either it was an idle dream, or what I now see is <lb/>
            an unreality; and yet this kiss is warm, loving, and sweet, <lb/>
            as Leucippe's was wont to be."-" Her bowels shall soon <lb/>
            be restored," was his reply; "the wound on her breast shall <lb/>
            be healed, and you shall behold her sound as ever, but be so <lb/>
            good as to cover your eyes, for I must call Hecate to lend <lb/>
            us her assistance."</p>
          <p>Believing him in earnest I followed his directions, and <lb/>
            he began to practise his juggling tricks and to mutter <lb/>
            certain sounds, at the same time removing the contri­ <lb/>
            vances from Leucippe's body and restoring her to her <lb/>
            usual appearance. " Uncover your face," he at length <lb/>
            exclaimed. Slowly and with great trepidation-for I really <lb/>
            believed that Hecate was there.—I removed my hands from <lb/>
            my eyes, and beheld Leucippe's own sweet self, unharmed <lb/>
            in any way: more astonished than ever, " My dear Mene­ <lb/>
            laus," said I, "if you are the minister of any god, tell me <lb/>
            where we are, and what all these things meau."-" Do not <lb/>
            frighten him any more," interrupted Leucippe, " but at once <lb/>
            tell him how you contrived to outwit the buccaneers."— <lb/>
            " You may remember my telling you on board ship," said <lb/>
            Menelaus, " that I am by birth an Egyptian ; my property <lb/>
            lies chiefly about this village, and I am consequently well <lb/>
            acquainted with the principal persons in it; when I and <lb/>
            Satyrus after being shipwrecked were thrown on shore we <lb/>
            were conducted into the presence of the pirate chief; some <lb/>
            of his people soon recognized me, upon which my chains <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            were taken off, and after assuring me of safety I was <lb/>
            strongly urged to join their company as being in some degree <lb/>
            already known to them. Upon this I required that Sa­ <lb/>
            tyrus should be delivered up to me, declaring him to be a <lb/>
            slave of mine: ' Your wish shall be complied with,' they <lb/>
            replied, ' provided you first give some proof of courage in <lb/>
            our cause.' Fortunately they had just then been com­ <lb/>
            manded by an oracle to offer up a virgin as an expiation for <lb/>
            their robber band, and after tasting the victimis entrails <lb/>
            they were to place the body in a coffin and to retire from <lb/>
            the scene of sacrifice. The object of this was to strike <lb/>
            terror into the minds of the hostile force; but," continued <lb/>
            he, addressing Satyrus, " the rest of the story belongs more <lb/>
            properly to you."</p>
          <p>" Upon learning that Leucippe was taken captive," said <lb/>
            Satyrus, taking up the narrative, " I felt sincere regret on <lb/>
            her behalf, and urged Menelaus by all means to save her; <lb/>
            some good genius came to our assistance; the day before <lb/>
            the sacrifice we were sitting by the sea-shore, overcome <lb/>
            with grief and considering what steps were to be taken. <lb/>
            Some of the buccaneers espying a vessel which had got out <lb/>
            of her course from ignorance of the coast, hurried down to <lb/>
            attack her; the crew endeavoured to put out to sea, but <lb/>
            being too late they prepared for resistance.</p>
          <p>" There happened to be among them a stage-player or <lb/>
            reciter of Homeric poetry.. Arming himself and the rest <lb/>
            after the manner of the heroes of the Iliad, they offered a <lb/>
            brave resistance, but being at last overpowered by a number <lb/>
            of the pirate boats, their vessel was sunk and themselves <lb/>
            were slaughtered. It chanced that after this a chest floated <lb/>
            on shore unperceived by the buccaneers; Menelaus getting <lb/>
            it into a retired spot opened it, supposing it might contain <lb/>
            something valuable; among the contents were a cloak and <lb/>
            a sword with a hilt five palms in length, the blade of which <lb/>
            was not so long: while Menelaus was carelessly handling <lb/>
            it, the blade flew out and became equal to the hilt in length, <lb/>
            and a different movement reduced it, to its former dimen­ <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥαψωδός</foreign>—one of a class of persons who got their living by <lb/>

            sions ; the ill fated owner had no doubt been accustomed to <lb/>
            use it upon the stage for the infliction of mimic wounds. <lb/>
            I immediately said to Menelaus, if only you will now give <lb/>
            proof of your courage, the deity will second us, and we shall <lb/>
            be able to preserve the maiden without being discovered by <lb/>
            the buccaneers. We will get a sheepskin, one of the <lb/>
            softest and most flexible which can be procured, this we <lb/>
            will sew into the shape of a bag, corresponding in size with <lb/>
            the human stomach, and after filling it with entrails and <lb/>
            blood, we will secure the opening; having done this, we <lb/>
            will fasten it upon the maiden's body, and by throwing <lb/>
            over her a robe bound by a girdle and other fastenings we <lb/>
            can easily conceal the artifice. The nature of the oracle <lb/>
            given to the pirates and the construction of the sword, are <lb/>
            both strongly in our favour: the oracle commands that the <lb/>
            maiden when adorned for sacrifice is to be ripped open <lb/>
            through her dress; and as for the sword, you see how art­ <lb/>
            fully it is contrived; if you press it against the human body, <lb/>
            the blade flies into the hilt as into a scabbard, while all the <lb/>
            time it will appear to the beholders to have been run into <lb/>
            the body ; on the present occasion just enough of the blade <lb/>
            will remain out to cut open the false stomach as soon as <lb/>
            the hilt reaches the sheepskin, and when withdrawn from <lb/>
            the wound, the portion of the sword contained within the <lb/>
            hilt will immediately fly out, so that it will appear to the <lb/>
            spectator that the whole of the weapon was really plunged <lb/>
            into the maiden. The pirates will not discover the deceit, <lb/>
            for as I before said, the skin will be concealed by the dress <lb/>
            put over it, and the entrails will immediately protrude <lb/>
            from the gash which it has made; these we shall place <lb/>
            upon the altar, and as no one is to approach the body, we <lb/>
            shall be able to place it in the coffin. You remember the <lb/>
            pirate-captain telling you that you were expected to display <lb/>
            some proof of courage; now is the time to go to him and to <lb/>
            make the offer.</p>
          <p>" I followed up my words by many entreaties, invoking <lb/>
            Jove the hospitable, and reminding Menelaus of our having <lb/>
            eaten at the same board * and suffered the same perils of <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸ ὸμοτράπεζον</foreign>-to have eaten at the same table, was considered <lb/>

            shipwreck. The worthy and true hearted man replied,' The <lb/>
            undertaking is arduous, but one ought to be prepared to <lb/>
            die in the sake of a friend,- and death in such a cause is <lb/>
            sweet.' I then expressed my belief that Clitopho was still <lb/>
            alive, for the maiden bad mentioned to me his being left <lb/>
            behind, among the other prisoners, in addition to which the <lb/>
            buccaneers who had fled, brought word to their captain, <lb/>
            that all the captives had contrived to escape into the enemy's <lb/>
            ranks during the engagement. 'You will therefore, I <lb/>
            added, 'be doing him a very great kindness and will also <lb/>
            be the means of delivering this unhappy maiden out of her <lb/>
            misfortunes.' I succeeded in persuading him, and Fortune <lb/>
            favoured us in our undertaking. While I was busied in <lb/>
            preparing what was needed for our contrivance, Menelaus <lb/>
            proceeded to the buccaneers to make the proposal already <lb/>
            mentioned. The chief, by a lucky chance, anticipated hint, <lb/>
            and said, ' We have a law, that new comers t amongst us, <lb/>
            should first begin the sacrifice, especially when a human <lb/>
            victim is to be offered; be ready therefore against to-morrow; <lb/>
            your slave also must take part in the solemnity.'—' We <lb/>
            will endeavour: replied Menelaus, ' to show ourselves not <lb/>
            inferior to any among yourselves.'—' Remember,' added the <lb/>
            pirate-chief, 'that it will be for you to dress and arrange the <lb/>
            maiden in the best manner for consummating the sacrifice.' ‡ <lb/>
            Afterwards, when alone, we took the opportunity of fitting <lb/>
            out Leucippe in the manner before related, bidding her <lb/>
            have no fear, and carefully instructing her what to do, en­ <lb/>
            joining her to remain quiet in the coffin, if necessary, the <lb/>

          <p>While listening to this narrative, I was overwhelmed by <lb/>
            a variety of feelings, and did not know how sufficiently to <lb/>
            express my deep gratitude to Menelaus; I however adopted <lb/>
            the most common method, and throwing myself at his feet, <lb/>
            I embraced his knees and worshipped him as a god, my <lb/>
            heart thrilling with delight. Being now easy concerning <lb/>
            Leucippe, " What," I inquired, " has become of Clinias?" <lb/>
            " The last time I saw him," replied Menelaus, "was when <lb/>
            be was clinging to the yard after the shipwreck; what <lb/>
            afterwards became of him I cannot tell."</p>
          <p>Upon hearing this, I could not repress a cry of grief in <lb/>
            the midst of my joy; no doubt some malignant genius <lb/>
            envied me the possession of pure and unalloyed happiness; <lb/>
            for this cause doubtless, he whom next to Leucippe I most <lb/>
            valued, was especially selected as a victim by the sea, that <lb/>
            not only his soul might perish,* but that he might lose the <lb/>
            rights of sepulture. Oh, ruthless ocean, thus to curtail the <lb/>
            full measure of thy mercy towards us!</p>
          <p>There being nothing to detain us longer, we all repaired <lb/>
            to the encampment, and passed the rest of the night in my <lb/>
            tent; nor was it long before the adventure became known. <lb/>
            At daybreak, conducting Menelaus to the commander, I re­ <lb/>
            lated every particular; Charmides was highly pleased, and <lb/>
            expressed himself in the most friendly terms towards him. <lb/>
            He next inquired what the strength of the enemy amounted <lb/>
            to. Menelaus replied, " That the whole place was full of <lb/>
            desperate men, and that the buccaneers numbered perhaps <lb/>
            ten thousand men."</p>
          <p>" Our five thousand," said Charm ides, "will be a match <lb/>
            for twenty thousand such as they are: besides which two <lb/>
            thousand men will shortly arrive from the troops who gar­ <lb/>
            rison the Delta and Heliopolis. While he was still speak­ <lb/>

            by shipwreck, where the body was swallowed up by the deep, was <lb/>
            especially dreaded by the ancients, since without burial of the body, <lb/>

            the buccaneers in that quarter had been repressed indeed, <lb/>
            but when the troops were on the point of marching, the <lb/>
            sacred* bird, bearing the sepulchre of his father, had ap­ <lb/>
            peared among them, and on this account the march must be <lb/>
            delayed during the period mentioned.</p>
          <p>"And pray," inquired I, "what bird is this which is <lb/>
            treated with such respect ? What sepulchre is it which he <lb/>
            carries with him ?”—“ He is called the Phœnix,” was the <lb/>
            reply; " and is a native of Æthiopia; he is about the size of <lb/>
            the peacock, but superior to him in beauty; his plumage is <lb/>
            bedropt with gold and purple,! and he boasts of being <lb/>
            descended from the sun, a claim which is borne out by the <lb/>
            appearance of his head, which is crowned by a splendid <lb/>

            but the Egyptians possess him after lie is dead. He is very <lb/>
            long lived,§ and upon his decease; his son bears him to the <lb/>
            Nile, having first prepared his sepulchre in the following <lb/>
            manner. Taking a mass of the most fragrant myrrh, suffi­ <lb/>

            beak, and the hollow becomes a receptacle for the dead; <lb/>

          <p>UPON hearing of the preparations made by the buccaneers, <lb/>
            and of the march of the reinforcements being postponed, <lb/>
            Charmides resolved upon returning to his former quarters, <lb/>
            and there to await their arrival. A lodging was assigned <lb/>
            by him to Leucippe and me at a little distance. No <lb/>
            sooner had I entered it, than taking her in not arms, I <lb/>
            endeavoured to accomplish my wishes; she would not con­ <lb/>
            sent however, upon which I said to her: "Do you not <lb/>
            observe how many strange and unforeseen accidents befall <lb/>
            us; first we are shipwrecked, then we come into the hands <lb/>
            of pirates, and next you are exposed to be sacrificed, and to <lb/>
            undergo a cruel death. Fortune has just now lulled the <lb/>
            storm, let us, therefore, take advantage of the opportunity, <lb/>
            before any yet severer calamity overtakes us."</p>
          <p>" It is not lawful for me to consent now, It was her reply; <lb/>
            " for while I was bewailing myself at the prospect of being <lb/>
            sacrificed, the goddess Diana appeared to me in a dream <lb/>
            and said: ' Weep not, maiden, thou shalt not die; I will <lb/>
            protect thee, and thou must remain a virgin until I conduct <lb/>
            thee to thine husband, who shall be Clitopho, and no one <lb/>
            else.' "</p>
          <p>Upon hearing this circumstance, I was very much annoyed <lb/>
            at the delay, but yet rejoiced at the prospect of future <lb/>
            happiness opened to me; and her mention of the dream <figure type="illustration">

              reminded me of something similar which had happened to <lb/>
              myself. I thought that during the preceding night I saw <lb/>
              the temple of Venus, and could discern the statue of the <lb/>
              goddess within; upon approaching it with the design of <lb/>
              offering up my prayers, the doors were suddenly closed, <lb/>
              and while standing there in a state of disappointment, a <lb/>
              female strongly resembling the statue of the goddess ap­ <lb/>
              peared to me and said: " It is not permitted thee to enter <lb/>
              the temple now; but if thou wilt wait for a short period, I <lb/>
              will not only open to thee its doors, but will constitute thee <lb/>
              my priest." I related this dream to Leucippe, and although <lb/>
              my attempts upon her chastity were not repeated, I could <lb/>
              net get over my feelings of vexation.</p>
          <p>An occurrence which just then took place gave Charmides <lb/>
            an opportunity of seeing Leucippe and conceiving a passion <lb/>
            for her. Some person had captured a very curious river <lb/>
            animal, called by the Egyptians the Nile-horse, and in <lb/>
            truth he resembles that animal in his belly and legs, except <lb/>
            that he has cloven hoofs ;* his size is equal to that of the <lb/>
            largest ox; he has a short tail, which as well as his body, is <lb/>
            devoid of hair; his head is large and round, with cheeks <lb/>
            like those of a horse; his nostrils are widely expanded and <lb/>
            breathe out sparks, as it were, of fiery vapours ;t he has an <lb/>
            immense under-jaw, which opens to nearly the length of his <lb/>
            head, and it is garnished with canine teeth like those of a <lb/>
            horse in shape and position, but three times as large. We <lb/>
            were invited to see this creature, and looked at it with <lb/>
            great interest; but the eyes of the commander were <lb/>
            rivetted upon Leucippe, of whom he immediately became <lb/>
            enamoured.</p>
          <p>In order to detain us there the longer, and by this means <lb/>
            to feast his own eyes, he entered upon a lengthy description <lb/>
            of the animal, its nature and habits, and the manner in <note type="footnote"> * HerA iL 71, commits the same error, using the expression <lb/>

            which it is captured; that it is so voracious as to eat <lb/>
            up a whole field of corn, and is taken by employing the <lb/>
            following stratagem. Having found out his usual haunt, <lb/>
            the hunters dig a deep pit, which they cover with reeds and <lb/>
            earth, underneath is placed a wooden cheat with open doors <lb/>
            which reach to the top of the pit. The animal in passing <lb/>
            over the spot at once falls into the chest as into a cave, <lb/>
            when the hunters, who have been on the watch, immediately <lb/>
            close the doors, and in this manner secure their prey. It <lb/>
            would be in vain to attempt capturing him by force; for not <lb/>
            only is he very powerful, but has a bide so hard and thick. <lb/>
            as to render him proof against any wounds; he may be <lb/>
            called the Egyptian elephant, and in strength comes next <lb/>
            to the elephant of India.</p>
          <p>" Have you ever seen an elephant P" inquired Menelaus. <lb/>
            “I have," replied Charmides, " and have conversed with <lb/>
            persons well acquainted with the peculiarity attending its <lb/>
            birth.”</p>
          <p>I here remarked that the animal was known to me only <lb/>
            having seen a picture of it. " Well, then," continued he, <lb/>
            " I will give you an account of it; for we have abundance <lb/>
            of leisure. The time of gestation with the female is ten <lb/>
            years,! so that when she brings forth her calf he is already <lb/>
            old. To this cause we may, in my opinion, attribute his <lb/>
            great bulk, his unrivalled strength, and his longevity; for <lb/>
            he is said to live longer than Hesiod’s crow.‡ His jaw may <lb/>
            be said to resemble the head of an ox, for it appears to have <note type="footnote"> * " The hide is upwards of an Inch and a half In thickness; it is <lb/>

              two horns; these, however, are the curved tusks of the <lb/>
              animal, between them projects his trunk, resembling a <lb/>
              trumpet in appearance and size, which is very convenient <lb/>
              for taking up his accustomed food or any other edible; any­ <lb/>
              thing of this description he seizes with it, and bending it <lb/>
              inwards, conveys it to his mouth; but if unsuited for his <lb/>
              palate, he turns round his trunk, and extending it upwards <lb/>
              delivers the article to the Ethiopian master, who sits upon <lb/>
              him as a rider does on a horse, and whom he caresses and <lb/>
              also fears, obeying his voice, and submitting to be beaten <lb/>
              with an iron axe. I remember once seeing a strange sight, <lb/>
              a Greek inserted his head into the mouth of the animal, <lb/>
              which with expanded jaws continued to breathe upon him. <lb/>
              As you may imagine, I was not a little struck with the <lb/>
              boldness of the man and the good-nature of the elephant. <lb/>
              The man told me that he had given the beast a ice for <lb/>
              breathing upon him, that his breath was almost equal to <lb/>
              Indian spices, and was a sovereign specific against the head- <lb/>
              ache. It appears that the elephant is aware of his medical <lb/>
              skill, and will not open his mouth for nothing, but like a <lb/>
              self-conceited physician, asks for his fee beforehand; upon <lb/>
              receiving it he becomes all complaisance, expands his jaws, <lb/>
              and keeps his mouth open as long as the patient pleases, <lb/>
              knowing that he has received a consideration for his breath."</p>
          <p>" How comes so ill-favoured an animal to have so fragrant <lb/>
            a breath?” I asked. " From the nature of the food upon <lb/>
            which he feeds," said Charmides. " The country of the <lb/>
            Indians is near the sun; they first behold the rising of that <lb/>
            deity, they feel his hottest rays, and from his influence their <lb/>
            skin acquires its hue.* Now there is in Greece a dark­ <lb/>
            coloured flower, which among the Indians is not a flower <lb/>
            but a leaf, like those which are seen on any tree; in that <lb/>
            land it conceals its fragrance, and is therefore in little esti­ <lb/>
            mation ; either it does not care for celebrity among its <lb/>
            countrymen, or else it grudges them its sweetness; but if <lb/>
            only it leave that country and be transplanted, it opens its <lb/>
            secret treasure-house, instead of a leaf becomes a flower, <lb/>
            and clothes itself with perfume. The Indians call this the <note type="footnote"> * “ Indi autem, quod calore vicini ignis sanguis in atrum colorem <lb/>
            versus est, nigri sunt facti.”—Hyginus. <lb/>

            black rose, and it is as common a food for the elephant as <lb/>
            among us grass is for oxen; and from feeding upon it, <lb/>
            almost from its birth, the animal exhales the fragrance of <lb/>
            his food, and his breath becomes a fount of sweets."*</p>
          <p>When Charmides had ended his dissertation and we were <lb/>
            departed, he not long after—for whoever burns with the fire <lb/>
            of love cannot endure delay-sent for Menelaus, and taking <lb/>
            his hand, thus addressed him:—“Your conduct to Clitopbo <lb/>
            shows you to be a sincere friend, nor shall you have to com­ <lb/>
            plain of want of friendship upon my part. I have a favour <lb/>
            to request which it is easy for you to grant, and by granting <lb/>
            it you will preserve my life. Know that I am desperately <lb/>
            smitten with Leucippe; you must heal the wound; she is <lb/>
            in your debt for having saved her.† Now I will give you <lb/>
            fifty gold pieces for the good service which I require, and <lb/>
            she herself shall receive as many as she pleases."</p>
          <p>" Keep your gold," replied Menelaus, " for those who make <lb/>
            a traffic of their favours; you have already received me into <lb/>
            your friendship, and it shall be my endeavour to promote <lb/>
            your wishes."</p>
          <p>Immediately afterwards he came to me and related <lb/>
            the whole matter. After deliberating what course to adopt, <lb/>
            dissimulation appeared most feasible, since it would have <lb/>
            been dangerous to give hi in an absolute refusal, for fear of <lb/>
            his employing violence, and it was wholly out of our power <lb/>
            to escape, surrounded as we were by the buccaneers in one <lb/>
            direction, and by his troops on the other.</p>
          <p>Returning to Charmides after a short interval, Menelaus <lb/>
            said:—“ Your object is accomplished. At first the maiden <lb/>
            gave a downright refusal, but at length, upon my redoubling <lb/>
            my entreaties and reminding her of her debt of gratitude <lb/>
            towards me, she consented; stipulating, however, for a few <lb/>
            days' delay until we can reach Alexandria; for this place <note type="footnote"> * According to the Commentators, it is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρυόφυλλον</foreign> or clove­ <lb/>

            his breath <lb/>

              being a mere village, everything becomes known, and there <lb/>
              are many eyes upon us."</p>
          <p>“ You fix a long postponement to your favour," said <lb/>
            Charmides. " Who can think of deferring his wishes in time <lb/>
            of war ? With an engagement before him, and so many <lb/>
            ways of death, how can the soldier tell whether his life will <lb/>
            be spared P If you will prevail on Fortune to guarantee <lb/>
            my safety, I will wait. Consider that I am about to fight <lb/>
            these buccaneers, and all the while a war of a different kind <lb/>
            is raging in my soul; a warrior armed with bow and arrow, <lb/>
            is committing havoc there; I feel myself vanquished; I am <lb/>
            full of wounds; prithee send for the leech with speed, for <lb/>
            the danger presses. I shall have to carry fire and sword <lb/>
            among the enemy, but love has already kindled his torch to <lb/>
            my destruction; extinguish this flame, I beseech, good <lb/>
            Menelaus ; it will be a fair omen to join in love before <lb/>
            we join in battle; let Venus, therefore, herald me on my <lb/>
            way to Mars.”</p>
          <p>" But you do not consider," rejoined Menelaus, " how <lb/>
            difficult it is to avoid discovery from her intended husband, <lb/>
            who is so enamoured of her.”—“ Oh! as for Clitopho, we <lb/>
            can easily get him out of the way," said Charmides.</p>
          <p>Seeing him so firmly bent upon his purpose, Menelaus <lb/>
            began to have fears for my safety, and suddenly bethought <lb/>
            himself of a fresh excuse. " If you must know her real <lb/>
            motive for this delay, it is that her monthly sickness is <lb/>
            upon her, consequently she must abstain from sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course.”—“ In that case," said the other, " I will wait three <lb/>
            or four days, which will be quite sufficient; but in the <lb/>
            meanwhile she can, at any rate, come and talk to me. I <lb/>
            can hear her voice, press her hand, and touch her person, <lb/>
            and kiss her lips. Her indisposition need be no impedi. <lb/>
            ment to this."</p>
          <p>When Menelaus told this to me, I exclaimed, that I <lb/>
            would sooner die than have Leucippe bestow her lips upon <lb/>
            another. “ A kiss," I said, “ is the best part of love; the <lb/>
            moment of actual enjoyment is soon over, and brings with <lb/>
            it satiety,* and is indeed worth nothing if we take away the <note type="footnote"> *“Who riseth from a feast, <lb/>
            With that keen appetite that he sits down !’ <lb/>
            Merchant of Venice. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="425"/>
            kissing. A kiss need have no limit to its duration; it never <lb/>
            cloys, it is always new.* Three things, excellent in their <lb/>
            nature, proceed from the mouth, the breath, the voice, and <lb/>
            last of all, the kiss, of which the lips are the instruments, <lb/>
            but the seat of pleasure is in the soul. Believe me, Mene­ <lb/>
            laus, for my troubles compel me to reveal the secret,! <lb/>
            these are the only favours which I have received from <lb/>
            Leucippe; she is a woman only as having been kissed by <lb/>
            me; in all other respects she is still a virgin. I will not <lb/>
            put up with the loss of them; I will not have my kisses <lb/>
            adulterously dallied with.”‡</p>
          <p>" If such be the case," said Menelaus, “we must speedily <lb/>
            resolve upon some plan; one who is in love (like Charmides) <lb/>
            as long as he has a hope of success will wait and feed on <lb/>
            expectation, but if driven to despair, his love changes into <lb/>
            hate and urges him to take vengeance upon the obstacle to <lb/>
            his desires; and supposing be has the power to do this with <lb/>
            impunity, the very fact of being free from fear deepens his <lb/>
            resentment and urges him on to his revenge." In the midst <lb/>
            of our deliberation some one hastily entered, and informed <lb/>
            us that Leucippe while walking about had suddenly fallen <lb/>
            down, and lay there wildly rolling her eyes. We hurried <lb/>
            to her, and finding her still lying on the ground, we asked <lb/>
            what ailed her? No sooner did she see me, than starting <lb/>
            up and glaring fiercely from her blood-shot eyes, she struck <lb/>
            me with violence upon the face, and when Menelaus endea­ <lb/>
            voured to support her, she proceeded to kick his shins. <lb/>
            Perceiving that she was labouring under frenzy, we seized <lb/>
            her by main force and endeavoured to overpower her, she <lb/>
            on her part resisted, and in her struggles was at no pains to <lb/>
            hide what women generally wish to keep concealed. So <lb/>
            great was the disturbance that at length the commander <lb/>
            himself came in, and witnessed what was going on. At first <lb/>
            he was suspicious of some fraud contrived against himself, <figure type="illustration">

              and looked sternly upon Menelaus; but seeing the truth, <lb/>
              he became moved by feelings of compassion.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile cords were brought and the unhappy maiden <lb/>
            was bound; upon seeing her bands confined in tIlls manner, <lb/>
            I besought Menelaus (all but a few having left the tent) <lb/>
            to set her arms at liberty; her tender arms, I said, can­ <lb/>
            not endure this harsh treatment; leave me with her alone ; <lb/>
            my arms shall be her fetters, and she may exhaust her <lb/>
            frenzy upon me; why, indeed, should I wish to live, since <lb/>
            Leucippe no longer knows me ? How can I behold her <lb/>
            lying thus bound, and though having the power, shew no <lb/>
            desire to release her P Has Fortune delivered us from the <lb/>
            hands of buccaneers only that she may fall a prey to mad­ <lb/>
            ness? Unhappy that we are, when will our condition <lb/>
            change ? We escape dangers at home only to be overtaken <lb/>
            by the shipwreck; saved from the fury of the sea and freed <lb/>
            from pirates, we were reserved for the present visitation— <lb/>
            madness! Even shouldst thou recover thy senses, dearest, <lb/>
            I fear lest the evil genius may have something worse in <lb/>
            store! Who can be pronounced more unhappy than our­ <lb/>
            selves, who have cause to dread even what bears the appear­ <lb/>
            once of good fortune! Let Fortune, however, again make <lb/>
            us her sport, provided only I can see thee restored to health <lb/>
            and sense! Menelaus and those present did all they could <lb/>
            to comfort me, saying that such maladies were not lasting, <lb/>
            and were very common in the hot season of youth; at such <lb/>
            a time the young blood, heated by the vigour of the body, <lb/>
            runs boiling through the veins, and overflowing the brain <lb/>
            drowns the powers of reason ; the proper course, therefore, <lb/>
            would be to have medical advice.</p>
          <p>Menelaus went to the commander without delay, and <lb/>
            requested that the physician belonging to tho troops <lb/>
            might be called in. Charmides readily complied, for a <lb/>
            lover delights in granting favours. After visiting her, <lb/>
            he said, we must make her sleep in order to subdue the <lb/>
            paroxysm of her disease; for sleep is the medicine of <lb/>
            every sickness,* and afterwards we will have recourse to <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig110.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="427"/>
              other means. Before leaving her, he gave us a portion of <lb/>
              some drug, about the size of a pea, which was to be dissolved <lb/>
              in oil and rubbed upon the top of her head, saving that he <lb/>
              would shortly bring a pill to act upon her bowels. We <lb/>
              followed his directions, and after her head had been rubbed <lb/>
              for a short time, she fell asleep, and slept till morning. <lb/>
              I sat by her bed side all night in tears, and when I saw the <lb/>
              cords which still confined her hands, I could not help <lb/>
              exclaiming, " Dearest Leucippe, bondage is still thy por­ <lb/>
              tion ; not even in sleep is liberty allowed thee! What <lb/>
              images, I wonder, are now passing before thy mind ? Does <lb/>
              sense attend upon thy sleep ? or do thy dreams also partake <lb/>
              of frenzy ?" Upon waking she uttered some incoherent <lb/>
              words. Soon after the physician came and administered <lb/>
              the other medicine.</p>
          <p>Just at this time pressing orders arrived from the Vice­ <lb/>
            rov of Egypt urging the commander to lead his men <lb/>
            against the enemy. The troops were immediately mustered­ <lb/>
            with their officers, and appeared on the ground in marching <lb/>
            order, when, after giving them the watchword, he dismissed <lb/>
            them to their quarters for the night, and next morning led <lb/>
            them out to battle.</p>
          <p>I will now describe the nature of the district against <lb/>
            which they marched. The Nile flows in an unbroken stream <lb/>
            from Egyptian Thebes as far as Memphis, when it throws <lb/>
            out a small branch. Where the wide part of the river ter­ <lb/>
            minates, stands the village Cercasorum*; there the country <lb/>
            becomes intersected by three streams; two flowing respec­ <lb/>
            tively to the right and left; the other continuing its onward <lb/>
            course traverses the district called the Delta; none of these <lb/>
            streams flow uninterruptedly to the sea, but upon reaching <lb/>
            different cities separate into various branches, all of them <lb/>
            larger than any Grecian rivers; its waters nevertheless are <note type="footnote"> “Sleep, that knits up the ravell’d sleeve of care, <lb/>

            not enfeebled and rendered useless by the many divisions in <lb/>
            their course; they bear vessels upon their surface ; they <lb/>
            are used for drinking, and contribute to fertilize the land. <lb/>
            The mighty Nile is all in all to the Egyptians, both land <lb/>
            and river, and sea and lake, and a singular spectacle it is to <lb/>
            see in juxtaposition the ship and the mattock, the oar and <lb/>
            the plough, the rudder and the hook,. sailors' cabins and <lb/>
            labourers' huts, a resort for fishes and a resting-place for <lb/>
            oxen; where but lately a ship sailed, is seen a cultivated <lb/>
            plain, and anon the cultivated plain becomes a watery space ; <lb/>
            for the Nile periodically comes and goes, and the Egyptians <lb/>
            count the days and anxiously await the inundation, while <lb/>
            the river on his part keeps to his appointed time, regulates <lb/>
            the rising of his waters, and never exposes himself to the <lb/>
            imputation of unpunctuality. Then comes the rivalry <lb/>
            between the land and water; each exerts its power against <lb/>
            the other; the water strives to flood the land, and the land <lb/>
            does its endeavour to absorb the fertilizing water; in the <lb/>
            end, conquest can be assigned to neither, but both may <lb/>
            claim the victory, for each is co-extensive with the other. <lb/>
            In the pasturage which is the resort of the buccaneers, a <lb/>
            quantity of water is at all times found, for even when the <lb/>
            Nile retires, the lakes formed by its inundation continue <lb/>
            filled with watery mud ; over these the inhabitants can <lb/>
            either wade on foot or pass in boats, each of which will <lb/>
            contain one person; any other kind would be imbedded in <lb/>
            the mud, but those which they employ are so light† as to <lb/>
            require very little water, and should none be found they <lb/>
            take them on their backs, and proceed on foot until they <lb/>
            arrive at more. These lakes, which I have mentioned, are <lb/>
            dotted over with islets, some of them uninhabited, but <lb/>
            abounding in papyrus reeds, between the intervals of which <lb/>
            there is only room for a man to stand, while the space <lb/>
            above is overarched by the summits of the leaves; it is in <note type="footnote"> * Instead of the common reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρόπαιον</foreign>, which yields no sense <lb/>

            these places that the buccaneers assemble, and secretly <lb/>
            concert their plans, masked by these reeds as by a fort. <lb/>
            Some of the islets have huts upon them, presenting the <lb/>
            appearance of a rudely constructed town, which serve as <lb/>
            the dwellings of the pirates. One of them, more remarkable <lb/>
            than the other for its extent and for the number of its huts, <lb/>
            was called Nicochis, and here it was that the main body of <lb/>
            the freebooters was collected; confiding in their numbers, <lb/>
            and in the strength of their position, the place being entirely <lb/>
            insulated by lagoons, except for a narrow causeway the <lb/>
            eighth of a mile long and seventy feet wide. As soon as <lb/>
            they weie aware of the commander's approach, they had <lb/>
            recourse to the following stratagem :—mustering all the <lb/>
            old men, they equipped them as suppliants, with palm <lb/>
            branches, commanding the most able-bodied among the <lb/>
            youth to follow, armed with swords and shields. The old <lb/>
            men were to hold aloft their suppliant branches, the foliage <lb/>
            of which would serve to conceal those in the rear,* who, by <lb/>
            way of farther precaution, were directed to stoop and trail <lb/>
            their spears along the ground.</p>
          <p>In case the commander yielded to the old men's suppli­ <lb/>
            cations, the others were to make no hostile movements; if, <lb/>
            on the contrary, he should reject their entreaties, they were <lb/>
            to invite liin to their city, with the offer of there surrender­ <lb/>
            ing themselves up to death; if he agreed to follow them, <lb/>
            upon arriving at the middle of the narrow causeway, the <lb/>
            old men, at a preconcerted signal, were to throw away their <lb/>
            branches and make their escape, while the others were to <lb/>
            make an assault with might and main. They proceeded to <lb/>
            execute these directions, and upon approaching the corn. <lb/>
            mander, entreated him to reverence their old age and <lb/>
            suppliant branches, and to take pity upon their town ; they <lb/>
            offered him a present of a hundred talents of silver for him­ <lb/>
            self, together with an hundred hostages, to be forwarded <lb/>
            by him to the seat of goverment.t <note type="footnote"> # " Let every soldier he,,- him down a bough, <lb/>
            And bear’t before him; thereby shall we shadow <lb/>

              They were quite sincere in making these proposals, and <lb/>
              would have fulfilled them faithfully had he consented ; upon <lb/>
              his refusal, "We must then," said they, “ submit to our <lb/>
              destiny; at least grant us this one favour: do not put us <lb/>
              to death at a distance from our town, conduct us to our <lb/>
              ‘ fatherland,’ to our hearths and homes, and there let us <lb/>
              find our grave. We ourselves are ready to lead the way! <lb/>
              Upon hearing these words, Charmides laid aside his dis­ <lb/>
              positions for battle, and ordered his forces to follow leisurely. <lb/>
              The buccaneers had meanwhile posted some scouts at a <lb/>
              distance, who were to watch the movements of the enemy, <lb/>
              and who, when they bad reached the causeway, were to let <lb/>
              out the waters upon them. The canals which issue from <lb/>
              the branches of the Nile have high banks, to hinder the <lb/>
              river from flooding the land before the time, and when the <lb/>
              fields require watering, a portion of the bank is cut through. <lb/>
              Now there was a long and wide canal behind the town <lb/>
              which we are speaking of; those who were stationed for the <lb/>
              purpose cut through the banks as soon as they saw the <lb/>
              enemy approaching, and in a moment the old men fled, the <lb/>
              others charged with their spears, on rolled the waters <lb/>
              rising higher and higher, the causeway was flooded, and all <lb/>
              around became a sea.</p>
          <p>The buccaneers at the first onset speared the foremost <lb/>
            of the enemy, together with their commander, who were <lb/>
            taken by surprise, and therefore quite unprepared, and <lb/>
            it is difficult to describe the various ways in which the <lb/>
            others perished. Some fell before they could even handle <lb/>
            their weapons; some before they could offer any resist­ <lb/>
            ance ; for to see their assailants and to receive their <lb/>
            own death-wound was simultaneous ; others were slain <lb/>
            before they could see the hand which slew them; some <lb/>
            overcome by terror, remained motionless awaiting death; <lb/>
            others upon attempting to move were taken off their legs <lb/>
            by the force of the stream, while others again, who had <lb/>
            betaken themselves to flight, were carried along and drowned <lb/>
            in the deep part of the lagoons, where the water was above <lb/>
            their heads ; those even who were upon land had water <lb/>
            up to their middles, which, by turning aside their shields, <lb/>
            exposed their bodies to the enemy. The difficulty of know­ <lb/>
             <pb n="431"/>
            Ing what was land and what was not, retarded many, and <lb/>
            was the cause of their being taken prisoners; while others <lb/>
            supposing themselves still on land came into deep water <lb/>
            and were drowned; here were to be seen mishaps and <lb/>
            wrecks of an unwonted kind,-a land engagement on the <lb/>
            water, and a wreck upon the land.*</p>
          <p>The buccaneers were greatly elated by their success, and <lb/>
            attributed their victory not to fraud but to their own <lb/>
            valour; for among the Egyptians their fear degenerates <lb/>
            into abject cowardice, and their courage mounts to rash­ <lb/>
            ness ; in this respect they are always iu extremes, and are <lb/>
            wholly subject either to the excess or the defect. Ten <lb/>
            days had now passed and Leucippe was no better; upon <lb/>
            one occasion while asleep she cried out in a frenzied manner, <lb/>
            " Gorgias, it is thou who hast driven me mad !”† I told <lb/>
            Menelaus of this in the morning, and began to consider <lb/>
            whether there was any one in the village of that name. <lb/>
            We were just going out, when a young man met and <lb/>
            accosted me, saying, "I am come to save you and your <lb/>
            wife." Perfectly astounded, and thinking that his coming <lb/>
            was providential, " Are you Gorgias ?" I inquired.—“ No," <lb/>
            replied he, "my name is Chæreas ; Gorgias is the cause <lb/>
            of all the mischief." I felt a thrill run through me, as I <lb/>
            asked, "What mischief do you mean? Who is Gorgias? <lb/>
            Some deity betrayed his name to me last night; be you an <lb/>
            interpreter of the announcement."</p>
          <p>“Gorgias," ho resumed, " was an Egyptian soldier; he <lb/>
            is now no more, having been slain by the buccaneers. lie <lb/>

            Leucippe's drink ; he neglected to dilute the potion, so that <lb/>
            instead of producing love it brought on madness. I was <note type="footnote"> * The same manner of expression is used by Apuleius, B. iv., of the <lb/>

            informed of all this yesterday by Gorgias' servant, who <lb/>
            accompanied his master against the buccaneers, and who <lb/>
            seems to have been specially preserved by Fortune for your <lb/>
            sake. He asks four pieces of gold for effecting your wife's <lb/>
            recovery, having, as he says, a drug which will counteract <lb/>
            the effects of that which has been administered." " All <lb/>
            blessings attend you for this good service !” I exclaimed; <lb/>
            “pray bring the man here of whom you speak."</p>
          <p>No sooner was he departed on this errand, than going <lb/>
            in to the Egyptian, I struck him repeatedly about the head <lb/>
            with my clenched fist, saying at every blow, "What was it <lb/>
            which you gave Leucippe ? What is it which has caused <lb/>
            her madness ?" The fellow in his fright confessed every­ <lb/>
            thing, confirming what Chæreas had already said; upon <lb/>
            which we thrust him into prison, and there kept him. By <lb/>
            this time Chæreas had returned, bringing the man with <lb/>
            him. " Here are your four gold pieces as the reward for <lb/>
            your seasonable information ; but before you proceed to do <lb/>
            anything, hear my opinion. As this lady's illness has been <lb/>
            caused by swallowing a drug, I cannot but think it danger­ <lb/>

            are the ingredients in your proposed remedy, and compound <lb/>
            it in my presence; upon these conditions I will give you <lb/>
            four more gold pieces." " Your apprehensions are reason­ <lb/>
            able," he replied; " but the ingredients in my medicine <lb/>
            are all common and fit for human food, and I will myself <lb/>
            swallow the same quantity which I give the lady." After <lb/>
            specifying the various ingredients, he sent some one out <lb/>
            to procure them; and as. soon as they were brought, he <lb/>
            pounded them together in our presence, made two draughts <lb/>
            of them, saying, " one of them I will drink off, the other is <lb/>
            for the lady; it will make her sleep all night, and in the <lb/>
            morning she will awake quite recovered." He then swal­ <lb/>
            lowed the draught, and ordered the other to be taken at <lb/>
            night. " I must now go and lie down," he said, " under <lb/>
            the influence of the medicine." With these words he left <lb/>
            us, having received the stipulated sum, and with the <lb/>
            assurance of the additional reward being paid him, if Leu­ <lb/>
            cippe should recover. When the hour arrived for adminis­ <lb/>
            tering the draught, I poured it out, and thus addressed it : <lb/>
             <pb n="433"/>
            “Offspring of the Earth, gift of .Esculapius, mâÿ the pro­ <lb/>
            mises made of thee be verified; shew thyself propitious and <lb/>
            preserve my beloved; subdue the power of that ruthless <lb/>
            potion." Thus having entered into a kind of compact <lb/>
            with the medicine, I kissed the cup and give it to Leucippe. <lb/>
            She soon fell into a profound sleep, and while sitting beside <lb/>
            her I said to her, as if she could still hear me, “ Wilt thou <lb/>
            really recover thy senses ? Wilt thou know me again ? <lb/>
            Shall I hear that dear voice of thine ? Give some token in <lb/>
            thy sleep, as yesternight thou didst concerning Gorgias; <lb/>
            happier are thy sleeping than thy waking hours; frenzy is <lb/>
            thy portion when awake, but thou art inspired by Wisdom <lb/>
            when asleep.</p>
          <p>At length my words and thoughts were interrupted by <lb/>
            the anxiously-expected break of day, and I heard Leucippe's <lb/>
            voice calling me by name. Instantly I hurried to her side, <lb/>
            and inquired how she felt; she appeared to have no know­ <lb/>
            ledge of what had passed, and seeing that her hands were <lb/>
            bound, expressed surprise, and inquired who had tied them. <lb/>
            Finding her restored to her right mind, I undid the knots in <lb/>
            great agitation, through excess of joy, and then related to <lb/>
            her all particulars. She blushed upon learning what bad <lb/>
            passed, and almost believed herself to be still committing <lb/>
            the same extravagance ; but my assurances gradually soothed <lb/>
            and restored her to herself. Gladly did I pay the man the <lb/>
            sum which had been promised him, and fortunately our <lb/>
            finances * were in safety, for Satyrus had our money about <lb/>
            his person† at the time when we were shipwrecked, and <lb/>
            neither he nor Menelaus had been plundered by the buc­ <lb/>
            caneers. While what I have been relating took place, a <lb/>
            much more powerful force arrived from the seat of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, which succeeded in completely destroying the pirate <lb/>
            settlement.</p>
          <p>As the river was now freed from any dangers on the part <lb/>
            of these marauders, we prepared to sail for Alexandria, <lb/>
            accompanied by Chæreas, for whom we had conceived a <lb/>
            friendship on account of the discovery which he had made <lb/>
            to us about the potion. He was a native of the Isle of <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφόδιαν</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> † <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτυχεν ἐζωσμένος</foreign>,—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ζώνη</foreign>, the girdle used as a purse. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2E </note> <lb/>

            Pharos, and his calling that of a fisherman; he had served <lb/>
            in a naval expedition against the buccaneers, and at its <lb/>
            termination had been discharged. The river which, owing <lb/>
            to the depredations of the pirates, had for a long time been <lb/>
            deserted, was now crowded with vessels; and a pleasant <lb/>
            thing it was to hear the songs of the sailors and the mirth <lb/>
            of the passengers, and to see so many craft passing up and <lb/>
            down. Our voyage was like a continuous festival, and the <lb/>
            river itself seemed to be keeping holiday.. I for the first <lb/>
            time drank some of the Nile water, without any admixture <lb/>
            of wine, being desirous to test its sweetness,-and wine, <lb/>
            I may remark, always spoils the flavour of water. Having <lb/>
            filled a transparent crystal glass, the liquid vied with, nay, <lb/>
            surpassed it in brightness. It was sweet to the taste, and <lb/>
            had an agreeable coldness, whereas some of the Grecian <lb/>
            rivers are so very cold as to be injurious to the health. <lb/>
            On this account the Egyptians have no fear in drinking its <lb/>
            water, and stand in no need of wine. † Their way of <lb/>
            drinking struck me as being curious. They do not draw <lb/>
            up the water in a bucket, neither do they use any other <lb/>
            cup than that which Nature has supplied,-their hand ; <lb/>
            when any one is thirsty he stoops over the side of the <lb/>
            vessel, and, receiving the water in the hollow of his hand, <lb/>
            jerks it upwards with such dexterity, that it is received <lb/>
            into the open mouth, and not a drop is lost.</p>
          <p>The Nile produces another monster, more noted for <lb/>
            strength than even the river-horse, I mean the crocodilo.: <lb/>
            His shape is between that of a fish and a large animal. <lb/>
            Ills length from head to tail is great, and out of proportion <lb/>
            to his breadth; his skin is rough with scales; the surface <lb/>
            of his back hard and of a black colour, while the belly is <lb/>
            white. He has four legs, which bend in an oblique direction, <note type="footnote"> * See the description of the procession to Babastis, In Herod. iL 60, <lb/>

            like those of the land tortoise; his tail is long and thick, <lb/>
            forming a solid mass, and differing from that of other <lb/>
            animals in being the continuation of the spine, and there­ <lb/>
            fore a constituent part of the body, and on the top it is set <lb/>
            with sharp spines, like the teeth of a saw. It serves the <lb/>
            crocodile for an implement with which to capture his prey; <lb/>
            he strikes with it against his antagonist, and a single stroke <lb/>
            will inflict several wounds. His head grows directly out of <lb/>
            his shoulders in one line, for Nature has concealed his neck.- <lb/>
            The most formidable part about him are his jaws, which <lb/>
            open to an immense extent; so long as they remain closed <lb/>
            they form a head, but when expanded to take in its prey, <lb/>
            they become all mouth; (the animal, I may observe, moves <lb/>
            only the upper jaw) for so great is their expansion that <lb/>
            it reaches to the shoulders and to the orifice of the stomach. <lb/>
            He has many teeth, which are disposed in long rows : they <lb/>
            are said to equal the days of the year in number. Were <lb/>
            you to see the animal on land, you would not suppose <lb/>
            him to be possessed of so much strength, judging from <lb/>
            his size.</p>

          <p>WE arrived at Alexandria after a three days' passage. <lb/>
            I entered by the gate of the Sun, and was at once amazed <lb/>
            and delighted by the splendour of the city. A row of <lb/>
            columns, on either side, led in a straight line to the gate of <lb/>
            the Moon—these two divinities being the guardian gods of <lb/>
            the city gates. In the midst of these columns was the open <lb/>
            part of the city, which branched out into so many streets, <lb/>
            that in traversing them, one seemed journeying abroad <lb/>
            though all the time at home.† Proceeding a little farther I <lb/>
            came to a part named after the great Alexander; here <lb/>
            began a second city and its beauty was of a twofold kind, <lb/>
            two rows of columns equal in extent, intersecting each <lb/>
            other at right angles. It was impossible to satisfy the eye <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig112.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> 2F2 </note> <lb/>

              with gazing upon the various streets, or to take in every <lb/>
              object deserving of admiration; some of these one actually <lb/>
              saw, others one was on the point of seeing; others one <lb/>
              longed to see; others, again, one would not willingly have <lb/>
              missed seeing; those which were actually present nvetted <lb/>
              one's gaze; those which were anticipated tempted it to <lb/>
              wander: after turning my eyes therefore, on every side, so <lb/>
              distracted were my feelings of admiration, that I owned my <lb/>
              eight to be thoroughly bewildered and unequal to its task. <lb/>
              What most struck me was the extent of the city and its <lb/>
              vast population, each of which in turn bore away the palm <lb/>
              when compared with the other; the former seemed actually <lb/>
              a country, the latter, a nation. When I looked at the vast <lb/>
              size of the city, I doubted whether any number of inha­ <lb/>
              bitants could till it; and when I considered the multitude <lb/>
              of the inhabitants, I asked myself whether any city could <lb/>
              contain them ; so evenly balanced was the calculation,. and <lb/>
              so difficult was it to come to a decision.</p>
          <p>It chanced at that time to be the festival of the great <lb/>
            deity called Jove by the Greeks, Serapis † by the Egyptians; <lb/>
            torches were lighted up throughout the city, and the effect <lb/>
            of so much light was marvellous, for although evening had <lb/>
            come on and the sun had set, there was no such thing as <lb/>
            night, another sun might be said to have arisen, only that <lb/>
            his rays were scattered,‡ so that the city vied with heaven <lb/>
            in brightness. I also visited the magnificent temple and <lb/>
            saw the statue of the Milichian Jove, and after paying our <lb/>
            devotions to his great divinity, and praying him to end at <lb/>
            last, our troubles, we returned to the lodgings which Mene­ <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιαύτη τις ίσότητος τρυτάνη</foreign>. " The beautiful and regular <lb/>

            aus had engaged for us. The deity, as will be seen, did <lb/>
            not hearken to our prayers, and another trial of fortune <lb/>
            yet awaited us. Chæreas bad for some time been enamoured <lb/>
            of Leucippe, which was his motive for communicating to <lb/>
            me the circumstance of the philtre, by doing which he <lb/>
            hoped to become on intimate terms with us and to preserve <lb/>
            her life for his own ends. Knowing how difficult success <lb/>
            would be, he had recourse to stratagem. Being a seafaring <lb/>
            man, he had no difficulty in getting together some fellows, <lb/>
            half-fishermen half-pirates, with whom he arranged what <lb/>
            was to be done, and then under pretence of keeping his <lb/>
            birth-day, he invited us to an entertainment at Pharos. <lb/>
            As we were leaving the house a sinister omen befell us; <lb/>
            a hawk pursuing a sparrow struck Leucippe on the cheek <lb/>
            with its wing; alarmed at the occurrence I looked up <lb/>
            towards heaven and said—“ Jove, what means this omen? <lb/>
            If this bird be indeed sent by thee, show us, I pray, some <lb/>
            clearer augury." Upon turning round, I found myself <lb/>
            standing by a painters shop where was a picture, the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of which was in keeping with what had just taken <lb/>
            place; it represented the rape of Philomela, the cruelty of <lb/>
            Tereus in cutting out her tongue, every particular of the <lb/>
            sad drama was seen depicted on the tapestry,. which was <lb/>
            being held up by a female slave. Philomela stood pointing <lb/>
            to the different figures which were worked upon it, and <lb/>
            Procne was intimating that she understood her, at the <lb/>
            same time casting stern and angry looks upon the picture. <lb/>
            There, the Thracian Tereus was seen struggling with Philo­ <lb/>
            mela, whose hair was dishevelled, her girdle loose, her dress <lb/>
            torn, her bosom half naked; her right hand was planted <lb/>
            against the face of Tereus, with her left she was endeavour­ <lb/>
            ing to pull her torn dress over her breast; Tereus was <lb/>
            holding her in his arms, drawing her person towards him, <lb/>
            and embracing her as closely as ho could. Such was the <lb/>
            subject of the tapestry. In the remainder of the painting, <lb/>
            were seen the two sisters showing Tereus the relics of his <lb/>
            supper, the head and bands of his own child; fear and <note type="footnote"> * 6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέπλος</foreign>. The piece of tapestry on which Philomela, during her <lb/>
            captivity had worked the representation of her misfortunes, and which <lb/>

             <pb n="438"/>
            bitter laughter are depicted on their faces; Tereus is leaping <lb/>
            up from his couch and drawing his sword against them, and <lb/>
            he has struck out his foot against the tablo # which neither <lb/>
            stands nor falls, but seems in the very act of falling. " In my <lb/>
            opinion," said Menelaus, " we should give up the excursion <lb/>
            to Pharos, for we have encountered two unfavourable omens, <lb/>
            the hawk's wing and the threatening picture; now those who <lb/>
            profess to interpret such matters, bid us pay regard to the <lb/>
            subjects of any pictures which we may happen to meet with, <lb/>
            when setting out on any business, and to conjecture the <lb/>
            result of our undertaking from the nature of what we see. <lb/>
            Did you not observe how full of evil augury this picture <lb/>
            is ? There is depicted in it lawless love, shameless adul­ <lb/>
            tery and female misery; we ought therefore to defer our <lb/>
            expedition." I concurred in opinion with him, and we <lb/>
            excused ourselves from accompanying Chrereas on that <lb/>
            occasion; he left us, very much vexed at our determination, <lb/>
            saying he should come to us the next day.</p>
          <p>Women are naturally fond of hearing stories, accordingly <lb/>
            when he was gone, Leucippe turning to me said, " Pray <lb/>
            tell me what is the subject represented in this picture? <lb/>
            What birds are they? who are the women? and who is <lb/>
            that shameless man ?” I proceeded to gratify her wishes.— <lb/>
            “The hoopoe," I said, " was once a man called Tereus, the <lb/>
            swallow and the nightingale were two sisters named Phi­ <lb/>
            lomela and Procne, natives of Athens. One woman, it <lb/>
            seems, is not enough for a barbarian, especially when an <lb/>
            occasion offers for gratifying his lust; and such an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity was offered to Tereus through the sisterly affection <lb/>
            of Procne, who sent her husband to invite Philomela; he <lb/>
            conceived a passion for her, on his way back, made her a <lb/>
            second Procne; then fearing lest she should reveal the <lb/>
            deed, he, as the reward for her virginity deprives her of <lb/>
            speech by cutting out her tongue, our nature's glory.t The <figure type="illustration">

              precaution was fruitless, Philomela, by her skill contrived <lb/>
              a silent voice; she inwove the tragedy into a web, descrip­ <lb/>
              tive of the facts, her hand supplying the place of a tongue, <lb/>
              and revealing to her sister's eyes what otherwise would <lb/>
              have been whispered into her ears. Procne, learning <lb/>
              through this device the violence which had been perpe­ <lb/>
              trated, determines to take fearful vengeance; and two <lb/>
              angry women's minds, conspiring together, and influenced <lb/>
              by mingled feeling of jealousy and sense of wrong, contrive <lb/>
              a supper more detestable even then the rape.. They serve <lb/>
              up to the father his own child ; Procne had once been his <lb/>
              mother, now she had forgotten the maternal tie, so power. <lb/>
              fully do the pangs of jealousy prevail over those even of <lb/>
              travail; for women, when exacting satisfaction for a violated <lb/>
              bed, however deeply they may suffer in what they do, com­ <lb/>
              pensate the pain by the pleasure of inflicting vengeance.! <lb/>
              Tereus supped upon this hellish banquet, and afterwards <lb/>
              the sisters, trembling with fear yet laughing horribly, bring <lb/>
              in the remnants of his child upon a dish. He recog­ <lb/>
              nizes the miserable tokens, curses the food which he had <lb/>
              swallowed, and discovers himself to be the father of what <lb/>
              he had been feasting on. Maddened with fury, he draws <lb/>
              his sword, and is in the act of rushing upon the women, <lb/>
              when lo! the air receives them metamorphosed into birds. <lb/>
              Tereus also becomes a bird, and ascends after them ; and to <lb/>
              show that their change of form has wrought no change in <lb/>

              sailed to Pharos. Menelaus said that he felt indisposed <lb/>
              and remained at home. Chæreas took us first to the light- <lb/>
              house and directed our attention to the wonderful super­ <lb/>
              structure upon which it stood-a rock situated in the sea, <lb/>
              almost cloud-capped, and seeming to bang over the waters; <lb/>
              upon the summit of this arose the tower, which with its light <lb/>
              served vessels for a second pilot.* When we had viewed <lb/>
              this, he took us to a house at the extremity of the isle and <lb/>
              situated on the shore.</p>
          <p>In the evening, under pretence of his stomach being dis­ <lb/>
            ordered, he went out; in a short time we heard a great <lb/>
            noise, and suddenly a number of powerful men burst into <lb/>
            the room, sword in hand, and turned towards the maiden. <lb/>
            Seeing my dearest life about to be carried off, I rushed into <lb/>
            the midst of them armed as they were, and received a wound <lb/>
            in the thigh, from the effect of which I fell bathed in blood ; <lb/>
            they immediately put Leucippe into a boat and rowed <lb/>
            away. Aroused by the disturbance and alarm caused by this <lb/>
            occurrence, the commandant of the isle came up whom I <lb/>
            had known when with the army. I exhibited my wound, <lb/>
            and earnestly besought him to pursue the pirates. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, throwing himself and the soldiers with him into one <lb/>
            of the many boats which were in the harbour, he gave them <lb/>
            chase; I likewise was among the number, having caused <lb/>
            myself to be lifted in.</p>
          <p>When the pirates saw that we were gaining upon them <lb/>
            and were prepared for an attack, they placed the maiden <lb/>
            upon the deck with her hands bound behind her; some of <lb/>
            them, after calling out in a loud voice, " Behold the prize <lb/>
            you wish to win,” severed her head from her body, and <lb/>
            threw the trunk into the sea. Upon beholding this I <lb/>
            uttered a loud cry and was on the point of casting myself <note type="footnote"> * This celebrated light-house, situated at the entrance of the port <lb/>
            of Alexandria, was built by Sostratus of Cnidos on an island which <lb/>
            bore the same name, at the expense of eight hundred talents. It was <lb/>
            square, constructed of white stone, and with admirable art, exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly lofty, and in all respects of great dimensions. It contained <lb/>
            many stories, which diminished in width from below upwards. The <lb/>

            into the water, but was prevented by those standing near <lb/>
            me; I then requested the crew to lie upon their oars, that <lb/>
            some one might jump into the sea and if possible recover <lb/>
            the body for burial; they complied with my request and <lb/>
            two of the sailors throwing themselves over the boat's side, <lb/>
            got hold of the corpse and brought it on board. Meanwhile <lb/>
            the pirates plied their oars still more vigorously, and when <lb/>
            we were again nearing them they caught sight of another <lb/>
            vessel, and recognizing those in her, hailed them to come to <lb/>
            their assistance; these latter were purple-fishers * and like <lb/>
            the others pirates. The commandant, seeing the odds against <lb/>
            him, became alarmed and gave orders to back water,! for <lb/>
            the pirates instead of continuing their flight, were now <lb/>
            eager to provoke an engagement. Upon reaching the shore <lb/>
            and landing, I threw myself upon the body and shed bitter <lb/>
            tears.—“ Thou hast indeed died a double death, my dearest <lb/>
            Leucippe,"‡ I exclaimed, " divided as thou art between <lb/>
            land and sea; I have a remnant of thee, but thou thy­ <lb/>
            self art lost tome ; the division is unfair, for thy larger por­ <lb/>
            tion which I possess (thy body) is in reality, thy lesser, <lb/>
            (considering its worth,) while the sea, in retaining the <lb/>
            lesser part (thy head §), is in fact guilty of retaining all; <lb/>
            since cruel Fortune envies me the happiness of kissing thy <lb/>
            fair face, I will at least kiss thy neck." After giving vent <lb/>
            to these lamentations, I had the body interred, and returned <lb/>
            to Alexandria, where much against my will my wound was <lb/>
            dressed, and where I continued to live a miserable life, <lb/>
            though Menelaus did all in his power to console me. At <lb/>
            the expiration of six months, the violence of my grief began <lb/>
            to subside; time acts as medicine upon sorrow and heals <lb/>

            a time, yet it is gradually cooled and overcome by the <lb/>
            persuasive influence of time.</p>
          <p>One day, when walking in the public square, some one <lb/>
            came behind me, and without speaking a word, seized my <lb/>
            hand, turned me round, and warmly embraced me. For <lb/>
            a few moments I knew not who the party was, overcome <lb/>
            by surprise I mechanically suffered myself to be embraced; <lb/>
            at length, upon looking up and seeing his features, who <lb/>
            should it prove to be but Clinias, so uttering a cry of joy, I <lb/>
            returned his embrace with ardour. We then retired to <lb/>
            my lodging, where I told him the particulars of Leucippe's <lb/>
            death, and he related to me the manner of his escape.­ <lb/>
            “When the ship went to pieces," said he, "I laid hold of <lb/>
            one end of the sail yard, which was already crowded with <lb/>
            people, and endeavoured to hang on; after we had been <lb/>
            tossed about for some time, a great wave overtaking us <lb/>
            raised and dashed the yard against a sunken rock, from <lb/>
            which it rebounded like an engine, and shot me off as <lb/>
            though I had been hurled from a sling. I swam during the <lb/>
            rest of the day, but with little hope of being saved; at <lb/>
            length, when exhausted and abandoning myself to the will <lb/>
            of Fortune, I espied a vessel bearing down towards me; <lb/>
            so alternately lifting up my hands, I supplicated help by <lb/>
            gestures. Moved by pity, or perhaps merely obeying the <lb/>
            impulse of the wind, the ship came near me, and while <lb/>
            running by, one of the sailors cast a rope over the side; I <lb/>
            seized it, and was thus drawn out of the jaws of death. <lb/>
            The vessel was bound for Sidon, and some of those on board <lb/>
            to whom I was known showed me every kindness. We <lb/>
            arrived at the above city after two days' sail, when I <lb/>
            requested the Sidonians on board (the merchant Xeno­ <lb/>
            damas, and his father-in-law Theophilus), not to mention to <lb/>
            any of the Tyrians whom they might meet, the circumstance <lb/>
            of my being preserved from shipwreck. I did not wish any <lb/>
            one to know that I had been away from home, and if those <lb/>
            two preserved silence in the matter, I had hopes that <lb/>
            nothing would be discovered; five days only had elapsed <lb/>
            since my disappearance, whereas if you recollect, I had told <lb/>
            my servants that I was going into the country for ten days; <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            and fortunately I found this to be the prevalent belief <lb/>
            among a friends. Your father did not return home until <lb/>
            two days after this, upon his arrival he found a letter from <lb/>
            his brother, Sostratus (which came the very day after our <lb/>
            departure), in which he offered you his daughter's hand. <lb/>
            Upon reading it and hearing of our flight your father <lb/>
            was in great trouble, both because you had missed the <lb/>
            prize intended for you, and because after so nearly bringing <lb/>
            matters to a favourable issue, Fortune had failed merely <lb/>
            through delay in the arrival of the letter. Not wishing his <lb/>
            brother to know what had happened, he enjoined secrecy <lb/>
            upon Leucippe's mother, thinking it probable he should be <lb/>
            able to discover you, or at any rate, that upon hearing of <lb/>
            the betrothment, you would both gladly return, having it <lb/>
            in your power to realize the object of your flight. He is <lb/>
            now using every endeavour to find you out; and only a few <lb/>
            days ago, Diophantus of Tyre, just returned from Egypt, <lb/>
            informed him that he had seen you here ; immediately upon <lb/>
            hearing this, I took ship, sailed hither, and have for more <lb/>
            than a week been seeking you in this city. As your father <lb/>
            will soon be here, it is time for you to decide upon some <lb/>
            plan." He ceased speaking, and I could not help inveighing <lb/>
            bitterly against the cruel sport of Fortune. “How unfor­ <lb/>
            tunate is my lot, my uncle Sostratus gives me the hand of <lb/>
            Lcucippe, and sends me a bride from the theatre of war, <lb/>
            so exactly measuring the time as to avoid anticipating <lb/>
            our flight. My good luck and happiness comes just one <lb/>
            day too late !* Marriage and the nuptial hvmn is talked of <lb/>
            when death has claimed his victim, and it is a time for <lb/>
            tears! Whom do they now offer me for a bride ? Even <lb/>
            her whose corpse I am not permitted to possess entire!" <lb/>
            " You have no leisure for lamentations now," said Cli- <lb/>
            Dins; “what you have to settle is, whether you will return <lb/>
            to your own country or await your father's arrival here."­ <lb/>
            " I will do neither the one nor the other," I replied; "how <lb/>
            can I look my father in the face, after basely flying from <lb/>
            his house, and enticing away her whom his own brother <lb/>
            had entrusted to his charge? Nothing remains but to <lb/>
            quit this city before he comes." At this moment Menelaus <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig114.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="444"/>
              came in, accompanied by Satyrus, and upon seeing Clinias <lb/>
              they hastened to embrace him. When informed by us of <lb/>
              the state of affairs,—“ You have an opportunity," said Sa­ <lb/>
              tyrus, "of prosperously settling all your affairs, and of taking <lb/>
              pity upon a heart which burns with love towards you. <lb/>
              Listen," continued he, addressing Clinias, " Venus has <lb/>
              thrown a piece of good fortune in the way of Clitopho <lb/>
              which he is unwilling to accept; a lady, by name Melitta, a <lb/>
              native of Ephesus is doatingly in love with him ; so rare is <lb/>
              her beauty, that it fits her for a sculptor’s model.* She is <lb/>
              rich and young, and has lately lost her husband who was <lb/>
              drowned at sea; sibe earnestly desires to make Clitopho, I <lb/>
              will not say merely her husband but her 'lord paramount,'t <lb/>
              and freely surrenders to him herself and all she has. She <lb/>
              has passed two whole months here, endeavouring to persuade <lb/>
              him. Yet he, heaven knows why, looks coldly upon her, <lb/>
              and slights her suit, imagining, I suppose, that Leucippe <lb/>
              will come to life again."</p>
          <p>“In my opinion," replied Clinias," Satyrus speaks sen­ <lb/>
            sibly ; it is no time for hesitation and delay, when beauty, <lb/>
            health, wealth, and love combine to woo you; her beauty <lb/>
            will yield you delight, her wealth will supply the means of <lb/>
            luxurious enjoyment, and her love will gain consideration <lb/>
            for you ; consider, moreover, that the deity hates pride and <lb/>
            arrogance, so follow the advice of Satyrus and yield to des­ <lb/>
            tiny.”—“ Well then," said I, with a deep sigh, " do with me <lb/>
            what you will, since Clinias is of your opinion; one stipu­ <lb/>
            lation I make, however, that I am not to be pressed to con­ <lb/>
            summate the marriage until we arrive at Ephesus, for I <lb/>
            have taken a solemn oath to be connected with no woman <lb/>
            in this city where I have been bereaved of my Leucippe ?” <lb/>
            Upon hearing me say this, Satyrus hastened to Melitta <lb/>
            with the joyful tidings, and shortly after returned and said, <lb/>
            that upon learning them, she had nearly fainted from ex­ <lb/>
            cess of joy; he was also the bearer of an invitation to me <lb/>
            to come to supper as a prelude to the marriage. I corn. <note type="footnote"> * " Usque ab unguiculo ad capillum summus est festivissima <lb/>

              plied and proceeded to her house. No sooner did she see <lb/>
              me, than falling on my neck she covered me with kisses. I <lb/>
              must do her the justice of saying that she was really beau­ <lb/>
              tiful; her complexion was fair as milk, but tinted with the <lb/>
              rose,. her bright and sunny look was worthy of Venus her­ <lb/>
              self, and she had a profusion of long golden hair, so that <lb/>
              upon the whole I could not look at her without some plea­ <lb/>
              surable emotions.</p>
          <p>A costly supper was served, she now and then took some <lb/>
            of the viands for appearance sake, but in reality ate nothing, <lb/>
            feeding her eyes on me. Lovers find their chief delight <lb/>
            in gazing upon the beloved; and when once this tender <lb/>
            passion has taken possession of the soul, there is no time or <lb/>
            desire for taking food. The pleasure conceived by the <lb/>
            eyes flows through them into the mind, bears along with <lb/>
            it the image of the beloved, and impresses its form upon <lb/>
            the mirror of the soul; the emanation of beauty darting <lb/>
            like secret rays and leaving its outline on the love-sick <lb/>
            heart.† I said to her, " Why is it that you touch none of <lb/>
            your own delicacies ?—you are like one of those who sup on <lb/>
            the painter's canvas.”—“The sight of you,” replied she, " is <lb/>
            more to me, than the choicest viands and the richest wines,” <lb/>
            accompanying the words with one of her kisses which I <lb/>
            began to receive with some degree of pleasure; " this said <lb/>
            she," after a pause, " is meat and drink to me."</p>
          <p>In this manner did supper pass; at night she used every <lb/>
            endeavour to persuade me to remain and share her bed ; I <lb/>
            however excused myself urging the same reason which I <lb/>
            had previously advanced to Satyrus. Much against her <lb/>
            will she allowed me to depart, upon the understanding that <lb/>
            next day we should meet in the temple of Isis, in order <lb/>
            to arrange matters and to plight our troth in presence of <lb/>
            the goddess; accordingly I went thither the following morn­ <lb/>
            ing accompanied by Clinias and Menelaus, and we took a <lb/>
            mutual oath, I to love her in all sincerity; she, to take me <note type="footnote"> * is ’Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white <lb/>

            for her husband and to give me the control of all her pro­ <lb/>
            perty. I reminded her that the performance of these pro­ <lb/>
            mises was to be deferred until we should arrive at Ephesus, <lb/>
            for as long as we are here, I said, you must give place to <lb/>
            my Leucippe. Another magnificent banquet was pre­ <lb/>
            pared, which was in name but not in reality the marriage <lb/>
            supper, for as I have said, the consummation of our nup­ <lb/>
            tials was postponed. During the entertainment, when the <lb/>
            guests were wishing heath and happiness to the new mar­ <lb/>
            ried pair, Melitta turning to me, said half in jest, half in <lb/>
            earnest, " How flat, stale, and unprofitable is all this, like <lb/>
            the empty honours sometimes bestowed upon the dead; I <lb/>
            have often heard of a tomb without a body, but never till <lb/>
            now of a wedding without a consummation." * The next <lb/>
            morning, induced by a favourable wind, we sailed from <lb/>
            Alexandria; Menelaus accompanied us to the port, and <lb/>
            after many embraces and wishes for my having a more <lb/>
            prosperous voyage than formerly, took his leave; he was in <lb/>
            all respects a worthy and excellent young man, and we <lb/>
            mutually shed tears at parting. Clinias would not leave <lb/>
            me, but determined to accompany us as far as Ephesus, and <lb/>
            after remaining there some time, to return, as soon as my <lb/>
            affairs were comfortably settled. The wind continued in <lb/>
            our favour the whole day, and at night after supper we <lb/>
            retired to rest in a cabin which had been parted off for me <lb/>
            and Melitta in the hull of the vessel. We had no sooner <lb/>
            entered it, then throwing her arms around me she urged <lb/>
            me to consummate our marriage. " We are now," she said, <lb/>
            ‘ beyond the boundaries sacred to Leucippe, and within <lb/>
            those where you are pledged to perform your promise. <lb/>
            What need is there to delay until we arrive at Ephesus? <lb/>
            remember, the sea is not to be depended on, the winds are <lb/>
            faithless ! Believe me, Clitopho, I burn; would that I should <lb/>
            actually show the intenseness of the fire! would that it <lb/>
            possessed the same nature as the ordinary fires of love; <lb/>
            that so I might inflame you by my embraces ! but, alas ! it <lb/>
            has a nature peculiar to itself, and the flame which usually <lb/>
            extends its influence to both the lovers, in my case burns <lb/>
            only its possessor! Strange and mystic fire, which refuses <figure type="illustration">

              to quit its own peculiar precints; “ dearest Clitopho, let us <lb/>
              begin the rites of Venus!”—“ Do not," I replied, " urge me <lb/>
              to forget that reverence which is due to the departed; we <lb/>
              cannot be said to have passed the limits sacred to her me­ <lb/>
              mory until we arrive in another country. Have you not <lb/>
              heard how she perished in the sea ? I am therefore still <lb/>
              sailing over Leucippe's grave; nay more, her shade may <lb/>
              even now be flitting around our vessel: it is said that the <lb/>
              souls of those who have found a watery grave do not <lb/>
              descend to Hades, but wander about the surface of the <lb/>
              waves; for aught we know, she may appear to us in the <lb/>
              midst of our embrace. Besides, can you consider the tossing <lb/>
              waves of the uncertain sea, a fitting place for consummating a <lb/>
              bridal? Would you wish to have a fluctuating and un­ <lb/>
              stable marriage bed?—“Dearest,” the resumed, " lovers <lb/>
              need no feat her-bed, *every place is accessible to the god <lb/>
              of love; nay, rather is the sea a most proper and fitting <lb/>
              place for celebrating the mysteries of Venus. Is not that <lb/>
              goddess daughter of the sea: in. honouring her shall we not <lb/>
              be paying homage to her mother ? Everything around us, <lb/>
              moreover, is emblematic of the marriage rites; above us is <lb/>
              the sailyard (resembling in form a yoke t) encircled by- its <lb/>
              ropes;—what can more fitly symbolise a wedding than a <lb/>
              yoke and bands ? close to our bed is the rudder,‡ emblem <lb/>
              of safe arrival within the port; Fortune herself is clearly <lb/>
              guiding our nuptials to a happy issue. Neptune himself, <lb/>
              who wedded a sea-bride, will wait upon us with his choir of <lb/>
              Nereids; and the winds which sigh so softly among the <lb/>
              ropes seem to be chanting our nuptial song; look too, at <lb/>
              the bellying canvass, how it resembles a pregnant womb; <lb/>
              even this is not without its propitious meaning, for it tells <lb/>
              me that ere long you will be a father!"</p>
          <p>Seeing her become so pressing and so excited, I replied,­ <lb/>
            " Let us, if you will, continue to discuss these subtle points <lb/>

              tient as yourself; but remember that even the sea has its <lb/>
              peculiar laws; and I have often beard say from ancient <lb/>
              mariners that ships must not be made the scenes of amo­ <lb/>
              rous delights, either as being sacred in themselves,. or <lb/>
              because wanton pleasure is unseemly amid the perils of the <lb/>
              ocean. Let us not then, my love, cast insult upon the sea, <lb/>
              or cause our nuptials to be distracted by alarms, rather let <lb/>
              us keep in store for ourselves pure and unalloyed delight." <lb/>
              These arguments mingled with kisses and endearments, <lb/>
              produced the desired effect; and we passed the remainder <lb/>
              of the night in sleep. Five days more, brought us to <lb/>
              Ephesus ; Melitta's house was one of the finest in the city, <lb/>
              it was spacious and handsomely furnished, and she had a <lb/>
              numerous establishment. After ordering a handsome supper <lb/>
              she proposed that we should in the meanwhile visit her <lb/>
              country-house, which was not more than half a mile out of <lb/>
              town; we rode there in her carriage, and then getting out <lb/>
              walked about in the kitchen-garden.† Suddenly a female <lb/>
              approached and threw herself at Melitta's feet; she had on <lb/>
              heavy fetters and held in her hand a hoe, her hair had been cut <lb/>
              off, her whole appearance was squalid, and her clothing con­ <lb/>
              sisted of a sorry tunic. " Lady,” the exclaimed, " have pity <lb/>
              upon one of your own sex, who once was free, but is now by <lb/>
              the caprice of Fortune, a slave.”–“ Rise up," replied Melitta, <lb/>
              “ and tell me who you are and from whence you came, and <lb/>
              by whom you have been thus fettered; for though in rags <lb/>

          <p>“Mistress,” replied the fellow, "all I know is, that a <lb/>
            merchant, called Callisthenes, sold her to me, saying that <lb/>
            he had bought her from some pirates, that she was free- <lb/>

              “Leucippe, to my master Clitophd.</p>
          <p>“I am in duty bound to address you by this title, since <lb/>
            you are united in marriage to my mistress. Although you <lb/>
            are well aware of my sufferings on your account, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary for me to remind you of them. For you I left the pro­ <lb/>
            tection of my mother and became a wanderer; for you I <lb/>
            suffered shipwreck and endured captivity among pirates; <lb/>
            for you I became an expiatory victim and underwent a <lb/>
            second death; for you I have been sold to slavery, bound in <lb/>
            letters, made to bear a mattock and to hoe the ground ; for <lb/>
            you I have been beaten with the scourge;—and all this <lb/>
            In order that you might become wedded to another woman <lb/>
            -tor suppose not that I will give myself up to any other <lb/>
            man No! I have borne, and without a murmur, all these <lb/>
            ills, and you, exempt from them, have been enabled to form <lb/>
            new marriage ties; if therefore you are impressed with any <lb/>
            sense of the sufferings which I have undergone for love of <lb/>
            you, urge your wife to send me home in accordance with <lb/>
            her promise, and undertake to be security for the payment <lb/>
            of the two thousand drachmas, which on my return, as I <lb/>
            shall not be far from Byzantium, I will procure and send; <lb/>
            though supposing you should have to pay them out of your <lb/>
            own purse, it will only be a trifling compensation for all <lb/>
            that 1 have suffered in your behalf. Farewell, and may hap­ <lb/>
            piness attend your marriage-and remember that she who <lb/>
            writes this letter has preserved her honour undefiled.” <lb/>
            Upon reading these lines, I became a prey to a succession <lb/>
            of conflicting feelings; love, fear, astonishment, doubt, joy, <lb/>
            grief, by turns took possession of my mind.</p>
          <p>“ Did you bring this letter from the Shades below," I <lb/>
            inquired of Satyrus. " What in the name of heaven does <lb/>
            till this mean ? Has Leucippe come to life again ?“ Most <lb/>
            assuredly she has,” replied he; " it is no other than she <lb/>
            whom you saw in the country, but she is so changed in <lb/>
            nppearance from having had her hair cut off,* that scarcely <lb/>
            any one would recognize her.”—“ And are you going to stop <lb/>
            short at this good news ?" I asked: “ Do you mean my ears <lb/>
            alone to be gratified and my eyes to have no share in <note type="footnote"> * Slaves were not allowed to wear their hair long. <lb/>

            the delight ?”“ For heaven's sake be Mutious,” was hit <lb/>
            reply; " let us first contrive some course of action, else you <lb/>
            will bring destruction on us all. Only consider; here is <lb/>
            this lady, one of the most distinguished for rank and wealth <lb/>
            in Ephesus, madly in love with you, and we are in the <lb/>
            midst of the toils without any possibility of getting free.”— <lb/>
            “ Talk not of caution," rejoined I, “ it is out of the question, <lb/>
            joy thrills too strongly through all my veins. Think, too, <lb/>
            how she upbraids me in her letter”–and upon this, I again <lb/>
            eagerly ran over the contents, fancying I could see her in <lb/>
            every line, and ejaculating as I read;—“ Yes, dearest Leu­ <lb/>
            cippe, I plead guilty to thy charge! Thou hast indeed <lb/>
            endured all these things for love of me I have been the <lb/>
            cause to thee of infinite misfortune ! " And upon coming to <lb/>
            the mention of the scourgings and other sufferings inflicted <lb/>
            upon her by Sosthenes, I wept as though actually a wit­ <lb/>
            ness of their infliction. Reflection turns the eyes of the <lb/>
            soul upon the purport of what wo read, and brings every­ <lb/>
            thing as vividly before us, as if it were actually being seen <lb/>
            and done. Such was the influence of Leucippe's words, <lb/>
            that her allusion to my marriage made me blush as <lb/>
            though I had been really surprised in the commission of <lb/>
            adultery.</p>
          <p>"Satyrus," said I, “what excuses shall I offer? Leu­ <lb/>
            cippe, it is clear, knows everything ; nay, her love may have <lb/>
            become changed into hate! But tell me by what means <lb/>
            she has been preserved? Whose corpse was that which <lb/>
            was buried ?"—" She will herself relate everything in proper <lb/>
            season," he replied.—“What you have to do now is to <lb/>
            write back an answer, in order to soothe her irritation. <lb/>
            I solemnly declared to her that you married your present <lb/>
            wife against your will.”—“ What I did you really tell her I <lb/>
            was married ? You have utterly undone me then! How <lb/>
            could you be guilty of such folly?”—“ Why tax me wit <lb/>
            folly? The whole city is aware of it.”—“ But I swear by <lb/>
            Hercules and my present Fortune that no actual marriage <lb/>
            has taken place.”–“ Nonsense! you share her bed.”–“I <lb/>
            well know, it said I, " that I shall not be credited, but <lb/>
            nevertheless I speak the truth: up to this very day Clito­ <lb/>
            pho has had no connexion with Melitta; however, the pre­ <lb/>
            sent question is, what am I to writa to Leucippe ? My mind <note type="footnote"> 2G2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="452"/>
            is so confused by what has taken place, that I really know <lb/>
            not how to begin.”—“ Upon my word," said Satyrus,“ it is <lb/>
            out of ray power to help you, but I have no doubt thatLove <lb/>
            will suggest materials for a letter; but whatever you do, <lb/>
            lose no time.” I at length wrote as follows:­</p>
          <p>" Health to Leucippe, mistress of my heart! It is my <lb/>
            lot to be at once happy and unhappy;—happy in that I <lb/>
            have you mentally present to me ; unhappy in that you are <lb/>
            really absent from me. Only defer pronouncing judgment <lb/>
            upon me until the truth shall be cleared up, and you will <lb/>
            find that the example of your chastity has been followed by <lb/>
            myself (if chastity may be spoken of in men); but if you <lb/>
            already hate and have condemned me unheard, I swear to <lb/>
            you, by those gods who have preserved your life, that ere <lb/>
            long you shall have proof of my perfect innocence. Fare­ <lb/>
            well, dearest, and still give me a place in your affec­ <lb/>
            tions!”</p>
          <p>This letter I delivered to Satyrus, desiring him to say all <lb/>
            he could in my favour to Leucippe. I then went back to <lb/>
            supper full of joy, but not free from grief, well knowing <lb/>
            that Melitta would not allow the night to pass without <lb/>
            pressing me to consummate our nuptials, and, having reco­ <lb/>
            vered Leucippe, it was hateful to me even to look upon any <lb/>
            other woman. I endeavoured to conceal wl:at was passing <lb/>
            in my mind, but it was to no purpose, so at last I feigned <lb/>
            to be seized with a shivering fit.</p>
          <p>Melitta guessed that I was seeking some excuse for not <lb/>
            complying with her wishes, though as yet she had no actual <lb/>
            proof. When, however, I arose from table without finish­ <lb/>
            ing my supper, and retired to rest, she got up and followed <lb/>
            me into the bed-room. I then pretended that I felt much <lb/>
            worse, upon which she became very urgent with me, and <lb/>
            said, " Why will you persist in acting thus ? How long will <lb/>
            you continue to disappoint me ? We have now crossed the <lb/>
            sea, we are at Ephesus; the time is come for realizing your <lb/>
            promise. Why should there be any more delay ? How <lb/>
            long are we to sleep together as though we were in a sanc­ <lb/>
            tuary ?* You place before my eyes a refreshing stream†, of <note type="footnote"> * See the phrase, " Noctes puras habere.”—Plautus, Asinar. iv. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> † See Proverbs v. 15—18. </note> <lb/>

            which nevertheless you prohibit me to drink; and though <lb/>
            sleeping near the very fountain head, I am parched with <lb/>
            thirst; my couch may compare with the feast of Tantalus.” <lb/>
            While thus venting her grief, she leaned her head upon ray <lb/>
            bosom and wept so piteously that I could not but sympa­ <lb/>
            thize with her sorrow; and feeling her reproaches to be <lb/>
            just, I really was at a loss what to do. At last I said, <lb/>
            " Believe me, dearest, by our country's gods, I feel an ardour <lb/>
            equal to your own! but this sadden indisposition has seized <lb/>
            me,–I know not from what cause,-and, as you are well <lb/>
            aware, without the blessing of health it is in vain to think <lb/>
            of love.”*</p>
          <p>While saying this, I wiped away her tears, and solemnly <lb/>
            assured her, that ere long she should obtain everything she <lb/>
            wished. Not without great difficulty, however, did I suc­ <lb/>
            ceed in pacifying her. On the following day Melitta called <lb/>
            for the maid-servants, to whom she had committed Leucippe, <lb/>
            and inquired whether every requisite attention had been <lb/>
            shewn her. They replied, that nothing had been omitted. <lb/>
            Upon this Melitta sent for her, and when she came into <lb/>
            the room said, " I need scarcely remind you of the kindness <lb/>
            you have experienced from me; all I ask as a return is <lb/>
            assistance which it is in your power to afford me. Now, I <lb/>
            understand that you Thessalian woment can, by your magic, <lb/>
            work so powerfully upon the minds of those you love, that <lb/>
            their affections, instead of wandering to any other object, <lb/>
            will thenceforth be wholly rivetted on you, their mistresses. <lb/>
            It is a magic potion of this kind which I now want from <lb/>
            you, to procure requital for the love which is consuming <lb/>
            me. You remember, doubtlessly, the young man who was <lb/>
            walking with me yesterday ?”–“ I suppose you mean your <lb/>
            husband,” replied Leucippe, maliciously, " for I have been <lb/>
            told by some of the household that he stands to you in that <lb/>
            relation.”—“A pretty kind of husband!” interrupted <lb/>
            Melitta; " he has in him more of marble than of manhood; <lb/>
            and my rival is a certain dead Leucippe, whose name, ,,-he­ <lb/>

            months have I spent in Alexandria, entirely on his account, <lb/>
            praying and beseeching him, and leaving nothing undone <lb/>
            likely to gain his love, but all to no purpose, for he remained <lb/>
            as insensible to my entreaties as any stock or stone; and <lb/>
            when at length be did give way, it was to become my bus­ <lb/>
            band but in name; for I swear to you by Venus, that after <lb/>
            sleeping with him for a week I have risen from his side as if I <lb/>
            had been sleeping with a eunuch; in short, I have fallen in <lb/>
            love with a statue, not a man.* To use the words, there­ <lb/>
            fore, which yesterday you addressed to me, 'Have compas­ <lb/>
            sion upon one of your own sex ;' give me your aid against <lb/>
            the overweening and unimpressible man ; by so doing you <lb/>
            will save my life, which is now fast ebbing from me."t</p>
          <p>Leucippe was rejoiced at finding that no intercourse had <lb/>
            taken place between Melitta and myself, and believing it to <lb/>
            be of no use to deny her magic skin, undertook to find <lb/>
            suitable herbs, if permitted to go and seek for them in the <lb/>
            country. These promises tranquillized Melitta, for the <lb/>
            mind is easily persuaded to feed upon the empty hope of <lb/>
            future good.‡ Meanwhile, knowing nothing of all thia, I <lb/>
            was in great perplexity how to put off Melitta during the <lb/>
            approaching night, and to contrive a meeting with Leucippe. <lb/>
            In the evening, Melitta, who had taken her out of town in <lb/>
            a carriage, returned,§ and we had just began our supper <lb/>
            when a great disturbance was heard in the men's quarter <lb/>
            of the house, and a servant rushed into the room, out of <lb/>

          <p>This Thersander was no other than Melitta's husband, <lb/>
            who was supposed to have been lost at sea, the report of <lb/>
            his death having been spread by two of his servants who <lb/>
            had been saved when the ship was wrecked. In a moment <lb/>
            he was in the room ; for, having learnt every particular by <lb/>
            the way, he had hastened home on purpose to surprise me. <lb/>
            Melitta, in great alarm at an event so utterly unlooked for, <lb/>
            started up and endeavoured to embrace her husband; who, <lb/>
            however thrust her from him with great violence, and then <lb/>
            catching sight of me and exclaiming, " So, here is the <lb/>
            spark himself !” he rushed towards me, and dealt me a <lb/>
            tremendous blow in the face, after which, seizing me by the <lb/>
            hair, he dashed me to the ground and beat me most unmer­ <lb/>
            cifully. All this time I remained as silent as if I had been <lb/>
            at the celebration of the mysteries, neither asking him who <lb/>
            he was, or why he used me so; for, suspecting the truth, <lb/>
            I had not courage to retaliate, though possessing physical <lb/>
            strength enough to do so.</p>
          <p>At length when he was weary of striking and I of form­ <lb/>
            ing conjectures in my mind, I got up and said, “Pray, who <lb/>
            are you, and what do you mean by this rough usage?" <lb/>
            More than ever irritated by the sound of my voice, he <lb/>
            recommenced his attack upon me, and called aloud for <lb/>
            fetters and handcuffs ; they were brought, and, after being <lb/>
            bound hand and foot, I was shut up in a room. During <lb/>
            this struggle, Leucippe's letter, which had been fastened <lb/>
            under my tunic to the fringes of my shirt,. fell to the <lb/>
            ground without my perceiving it, and was picked up by <lb/>
            Melitta, who feared lest it might be one of her own letters <lb/>
            written to me ; when, however, she had an opportunity of <lb/>
            reading it in private and met with Leucippe's name, it went <lb/>
            like an arrow to her heart, but having so often heard of her <lb/>
            death she did not at once identify the name with the female <lb/>
            whom she had set at liberty; but as she read on, and felt all <lb/>
            uncertainty upon the point removed, she became at once <lb/>
            the divided prey of shame, rage, love, and jealousy;—she <lb/>
            felt ashamed at exposure before her husband; she was <lb/>
            enraged at the contents of the letter; this passion yielded <figure type="illustration">

              to love on To account, which in its turn was stung by <lb/>
              jealousy; but love, in the end, remained triumphant. Ther­ <lb/>
              sander, after the first ebullition of his anger, had retired to <lb/>
              the house of a friend; Melitta, therefore, in the evening, <lb/>
              after speaking to the slave who kept guard over my apart­ <lb/>
              ment, came in privately, having for precaution posted two <lb/>
              of her servants before the door.</p>
          <p>She found me lying upon the floor, and approaching me <lb/>
            shewed by her countenance, that she wished, were it pos­ <lb/>
            sible, to give utterance in one breath to all her various <lb/>
            emotions. “ Wretched that I am," she at length ex­ <lb/>
            claimed, " fatal for me was the day when I first beheld you; <lb/>
            I, who have loved so madly yet so fruitlessly; who still <lb/>
            doat upon him who hates me; who pity him who is the <lb/>
            cause of all my pain, and whose love is not extinguished <lb/>
            even by injury and insult! — What a pair of juggling plot­ <lb/>
            ters against me are you both I You have all along been <lb/>
            making me your sport, and she, forsooth, is gone to procure <lb/>
            a philtre for me! Little did I dream that I was seeking aid <lb/>
            from those who were my bitterest enemies !" Thus speak­ <lb/>
            ing she threw Leucippe's letter on the ground; which I no <lb/>
            sooner recognized than a sudden chill came over me, and I <lb/>
            cast my eyes upon the ground as if convicted of a crime. <lb/>
            She then continued in the same strain : " What misery is <lb/>
            mine! My husband is lost to me through you, and hence­ <lb/>
            forth I shall be deprived even of the barren pleasure which <lb/>
            I have enjoyed, that of seeing you! Through you I have <lb/>
            incurred my husband's hatred, who believes me guilty of an <lb/>
            intrigue against his honour-an intrigue which has borne <lb/>
            me none of the fruits of love, and from which all I gain is <lb/>
            infamy! Other women receive enjoyment for the guerdon <lb/>
            of their shame: I inherit the shame, but obtain none of the <lb/>
            enjoyment! Barbarous and faithless man, how can you <lb/>
            allow a loving woman thus to pine away, when you are <lb/>
            yourself the slave of Love ? Did you not dread his anger ? <lb/>
            Had you no reverence for his fires,-no regard for his <lb/>
            mysteries ? Had these tearful eyes no influence over you, <lb/>
            -more ruthless as you are than any pirate!-for even a <lb/>
            pirate's breast will be softened by tears! Neither entreaty <lb/>
            nor opportunity, nor my close embrace, has persuaded you <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            to grant me so much as one amorous indulgence; nay, <lb/>
            most insulting of all, after yourself returning my kisses <lb/>
            and my embraces, you have risen from my side like any <lb/>
            woman! What is this but the very ghost of matrimony P <lb/>
            Remember also, that you have not been sharing the bed of <lb/>
            one who is grown old, or who repulses your embraces, but <lb/>
            of one who is young and ardent, and whom some might <lb/>
            consider possessed of charms,-eunuch that you are !— <lb/>
            unsexed and bane of beauty,- listen to my righteous <lb/>
            imprecation:-may Love requite your fires as you have <lb/>
            requited mine !”</p>
          <p>Tears for a time choked her voice ; but when I remained <lb/>
            still silent and with downcast eyes, a sudden change came <lb/>
            over her,t and she then resumed :— “ Dearest Clitopho, <lb/>
            anger and grief have hitherto dictated my words, but love <lb/>
            prompts what I am now about to say; for believe me, how­ <lb/>
            ever angry, I still burn with passion; however much wronged, <lb/>
            I still feel love; yield to my entreaties then, and even <lb/>
            now compassionate me! I no longer ask for joys of many <lb/>
            days' duration, nor for the lengthened wedlock which in my <lb/>
            folly I had dreamt of; I will be content with one amorous <lb/>
            embrace. I ask but a little medicine to palliate this pow­ <lb/>
            erful disease,-extinguish, in some degree, the flame which <lb/>
            now consumes me! Pardon me if I have spoken with too <lb/>
            much haste and bitterness, for love when unsuccessful is <lb/>
            pushed to phrenzy! Well aware how unseemly ray con­ <lb/>
            duct may appear, I am not ashamed to divulge the myste­ <lb/>
            ries of Love, for I speak to one already initiated,—to one <lb/>
            who knows by his own experience what my feelings are. <lb/>

            I ask the performance of your promise. Remember the <lb/>
            temple of Isis; show regard to the oaths which you took <lb/>
            there. Were you willing to live with me, according to the <lb/>
            troth you plighted, I would not care for a thousand Ther­ <lb/>
            sanders; but having recovered your Leucippe, you may not <lb/>
            wed another; accordingly I surrender every claim, and ask <lb/>
            only what may easily be granted. It is vain to resist my <lb/>
            destiny; all things evidently conspire against me,—even <lb/>
            the dead rise up again. Cruel sea, thou hast borne me <lb/>
            safely only to plunge me into greater ruin, bringing back <lb/>
            to me, for my confusion, the very dead. Nor was it <lb/>
            enough for Leucippe to revive in order to assuage the grief <lb/>
            of Clitopho, but the savage Thersander also must needs <lb/>
            come back; And he has dared to strike Clitopho before <lb/>
            my eyes without my having the power to aid him; he has <lb/>
            dared to disfigure that face upon which I doat. He must <lb/>
            have been blind to beauty when he did so! Once more I <lb/>
            entreat you, my Clitopho, lord, as you are, of my affections, <lb/>
            give yourself to me now, for the first time and the last; it <lb/>
            will be to me as if many days were crowded into one short <lb/>
            space! so may you never more be deprived of your <lb/>
            Leucippe; so may she never again die a fictitious death! <lb/>
            Do not scorn my love; it has produced your greatest hap­ <lb/>
            piness ; it has been the means of restoring to you Leu­ <lb/>
            cippe ; had I never been enamoured of you, had I never <lb/>
            brought you here, Leucippe would still be dead to you. <lb/>
            Some thanks are due to good fortune, Clitopho; he who <lb/>
            lights upon a treasure honours the spot where he discovered <lb/>
            it; he builds an altar, be offers a sacrifice ; be crowns the <lb/>
            place with flowers; but though you have found in me a <lb/>
            treasure full of love you despise your happy fortune ! Think <lb/>
            Love to be addressing you through my mouth, and saying, <lb/>
            ‘In this matter thou art bound to oblige me, thy tutor; <lb/>
            initiate Melitta in my mysteries; I kindled the fire with <lb/>
            which she burns.' Hear likewise how I have provided for <lb/>
            your safety; you shall be set free from these chains, whether <lb/>
            Thersander will or no, and you shall find a place of refuge <lb/>
            with In foster-brother for as long a time as you may <lb/>
            wish. In the morning you may expect to see Leucippe; <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            she is to pass the night in the country for the sake of <lb/>
            gathering herbs by moonlight,. for my simplicity was so <lb/>
            imposed upon, as to believe her a Thessalian, and to ask of <lb/>
            her a philtre to be administered to you. What else could <lb/>
            I do, when disappointed in my wishes, than have recourse <lb/>
            to herbs and drugs, the refuge of those who are unfortunate <lb/>
            in love. You need be in no fear of Thersander; he has <lb/>
            rushed out of the house in a rage, and betaken himself to <lb/>
            one of his friends. The deity, indeed, seems to have pur­ <lb/>
            posely contrived his absence, that I may obtain the last <lb/>
            favour which I ask. Let me then enjoy you, Clitopho!”</p>
          <p>After this earnest and impassioned pleading, suggested <lb/>
            by Love, who is a mighty master of eloquence,! she undid <lb/>
            the fetters ; and after kissing my hands applied them to her <lb/>
            eyes and heart: " Feel, said she, " how my Door heart <lb/>
            beats, agitated by fear and hope,—would that I could say, <lb/>
            by pleasure!—and seeming to supplicate you by its pal­ <lb/>
            pitations." When, after setting me free, she hung about <lb/>
            my neck in tears, I was no longer proof against human <lb/>
            weakness ; indeed I was in dread of incurring the wrath of <lb/>
            Love‡ himself, especially as I had now recovered Leucippe, <lb/>
            and was about to leave Melitta, so that our present coil­ <lb/>
            nexion would be no consummation of a marriage, but simply <lb/>
            administering relief to a love-sick soul. Yielding to these <lb/>
            reflections I returned her kisses and embraces, and though <lb/>
            without the help of bed or other appliances of amorous <lb/>
            delight, nothing was left to be desired. Love, indeed, is <note type="footnote">* .“has nullo perdere possum <lb/>

          <p>WHEN at length, I had sufficiently eased Melitta’s pains, <lb/>
            I said to her, " How do you mean to provide for my escape <lb/>
            and to perform your promises as to Leucippe?”—“Be in no <lb/>
            anxiety respecting her," was the reply, “ look upon her as <lb/>
            already restored to your embrace; but put on my clothes <lb/>
            and conceal your face in my robe ; Melantho will conduct <lb/>
            you to the door, there you will find a young man who has <lb/>
            orders from me to guide you to the house where Clinias <lb/>
            and Satyrus await you, and whither Leucippe will shortly <lb/>
            come." While giving mo these directions, she dressed me <lb/>
            so as to resemble her in appearance; then kissing me, she <lb/>
            said, "You look handsomer than ever in this attire, and <lb/>
            remind me of a picture of Achilles t which I once saw. <lb/>
            Fare you well, dearest, preserve this dress as a memorial of <lb/>
            me, and leave me your own, that I may sometimes put it on <lb/>
            and fancy myself in your embrace ; she then gave me a hun­ <lb/>
            dred gold pieces, and called Melantho, a trusty servant, who <lb/>
            was watching at the door, told her what to do, and ordered <lb/>
            her to return, as soon as she had let me out. Thus dis­ <lb/>
            guised I slipped out of the room, the keeper, upon receiving <lb/>
            a sign from Melantho, taking me for his mistress and <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτουργὸς</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἔρως καὶ αὑτοσχέδιος σοφιστη̃ς</foreign>, a passage parallel <lb/>

            making way; passing through an unfrequented part of the <lb/>
            house I reached a back door, where I was received by the <lb/>
            person whom Melitta had appointed to be there; he was a <lb/>
            freedman who had accompanied us on our voyage from <lb/>
            Alexandria, and with whom I had already been intimate.</p>
          <p>Upon her return, Melantho found the keeper preparing <lb/>
            to secure the room for the night, she desired him to open <lb/>
            the door, and going in, informed her mistress of my escape; <lb/>
            Melitta called in the keeper, who seeing the right bird <lb/>
            flown and another in his place,. was struck dumb with <lb/>
            astonishment: "I did not employ this artifice," said ohe, <lb/>
            “ from believing you unwilling to favour Clitopho’s escape, <lb/>
            but because I wished to give you the meaus of clear­ <lb/>
            ing yourself from blame in the opinion of Thersander. <lb/>
            Here are ten gold pieces ; if you choose to remain here, you <lb/>
            are to regard them as a present from Clitopho, if you prefer <lb/>
            getting out of the way they will help you on your journey." <lb/>
            “Mistress," replied the keeper, whose name was Pasio, " I <lb/>
            am ready to follow your suggestion." It was agreed, that <lb/>
            the man should go away and remain in concealment until <lb/>
            Thersander's anger had subsided, and he and his wife were <lb/>
            again upon good terms. Upon leaving the house, my usual <lb/>
            ill fortune overtook me; and interwove a new incident in <lb/>
            the drama of my life. Whom should I encounter but <lb/>
            Thersander ! who persuaded by his friend not to sleep away <lb/>
            from his wife, was returning home.</p>
          <p>It happened to be the festival of Diana, the streets were <lb/>
            full of drunken fellows, and all night long crowds of people <lb/>
            continued traversing the public square. I had hoped to <lb/>
            encounter no other danger but this, but I was mistaken, <lb/>
            peril of a worse kind was still in store for me. Sosthenes, <lb/>
            the purchaser of Leucippe, whom Melitta had turned out <lb/>
            of his office, no sooner heard of his master's return, than he <lb/>
            not only continued to act as bailiff, but determined to <lb/>
            revenge himself upon Melitta. He began by informing <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἕλαφον ἁντὶ παρθένου</foreign>, a proverb alluding to Diana substi­ <lb/>

              against me, acquainting his master with all which had taken <lb/>
              place ; he then invented a very plausible story above Leu­ <lb/>
              cippe, for finding he could not enjoy her himself he deter­ <lb/>
              mined to play pimp to his master, and by that means to <lb/>
              alienate him from nis wife.—“ Master,” said be, “I have <lb/>
              purchased a maiden of incredible beauty; words will not do <lb/>
              her justice, to form a just idea of her you must see her; I <lb/>
              have been keeping her purposely for you; for I heard that <lb/>
              you were alive and fully believed the fact, but did not choose <lb/>
              to make it public, in order that you might have clear proof <lb/>
              of my mistress's guilt, and not be made the laughing stock <lb/>
              of a foreigner and worthless libertine; my mistress took <lb/>
              her out of my hands yesterday and thinks of giving her her <lb/>
              freedom, but Fortune has reserved for you the possession <lb/>
              of this rare beauty; she has been Bent for some reason or <lb/>
              other into the country, where she now remains, and where <lb/>
              with your leave I will secure her until your arrival."</p>
          <p>Thersander approved of his scheme and bid him put it into <lb/>
            execution; accordingly Sosthenes proceeded to the farm, <lb/>
            and finding out the cottage where Leucippe was to pass the <lb/>
            night, he ordered two of the labourers to entice away the <lb/>
            maids, who had accompanied her, under pretence of having <lb/>
            something to say to them in private; he then went accom­ <lb/>
            panied by two others, to the cottage where Leucippe was <lb/>
            now alone, seized her and having stopped her mouth, car­ <lb/>
            ried her off to a lone habitation, where setting her down, he <lb/>
            said, “ Maiden, I am the bearer of great good fortune to <lb/>
            you, and I hope that you will not forget me, in your pros­ <lb/>
            perity ; be under no alarm at having been carried off, no <lb/>
            injury is intended you, it will be the means of obtaining <lb/>
            my master for your admirer." Leucippe could not utter a <lb/>
            word, so much was site overcome by the sense of the un­ <lb/>
            expected calamity. Sosthenes hurrying back informed Ther­ <lb/>
            sander of what he had done, again extolling Leucippe's <lb/>
            beauty to the skies; he was on the point of returning home, <lb/>
            but inflamed by the description, and having his mind filled <lb/>
            with such a lovely vision,* he determined at once to pay a <lb/>
            visit to the maiden as the festival was still on foot, and the <note type="footnote"> * It Nam si abest quod amen, præsto simulacra tamon aunt <lb/>

            distance not more than half a mile. It WAs when on his <lb/>
            way thither, that disguised in Melitta's dress I came <lb/>
            directly upon him. Sosthenes was the first to recognize me I <lb/>
            It Here comes the rake-hell himself," exclaimed he, “ mas­ <lb/>
            querading it, in my mistress's clothes !”</p>
          <p>The young man, my guide, who was a little in advance <lb/>
            hearing this, took to his heels in a fright without giving me <lb/>
            any previous warning. I was immediately seized by the <lb/>
            pair, and the noise made by Thersander drew together a <lb/>
            number of the revellers, when he became louder than ever <lb/>
            in his charges, heaping upon me all manner of abuse,. call­ <lb/>
            ing me a lecher, a cut-purse, and I know not what besides ; <lb/>
            in the end I was dragged to the public prison, thrust in, <lb/>
            and a charge of Crim. Con.† entered against me. The dis­ <lb/>
            grace of a prison and the abuse gave me little or no concern, <lb/>
            for as my marriage with Melitta had been public, I felt <lb/>
            confident of being able to refute the charge of adultery ; all <lb/>
            my anxiety arose from not having actually recovered my <lb/>
            Leucippe, for the mind is naturally inclined to be a " pro­ <lb/>
            phet of ill," ‡ our predictions of good are seldom realized. <lb/>
            In the present case I augured nothing favourable for <lb/>
            Leucippe, and was a prey to fears and suspicions of every <lb/>
            kind.</p>
          <p>Thersander, after having had me locked up, continued on <lb/>
            his way, and upon his arrival found Leucippe lying upon <lb/>
            the ground and brooding over what Sosthenes had said. <lb/>
            Grief and fear were plainly depicted upon her countenance; <lb/>
            indeed I consider it quite a mistake to say that the mind is <lb/>
            invisible, it may be seen distinctly reflected on the face as <lb/>
            in a mirror; in seasons of happiness joy sparkles in the <figure type="illustration">

              eyes ; In the time of sorrow the countenance is overcast <unclear/>* <lb/>
              and reveals the inward feelings. A light was burning in the <lb/>
              cottage; upon hearing the door open, Leucippe raised her <lb/>
              eyes for a moment and then cast them down again. It is <lb/>
              in the eyes that beauty has its seat, and Thersander having <lb/>
              caught a momentary glimpse of the beauty which (rapid as <lb/>
              lightning) flashed from hers, was at once on fire with love, <lb/>
              and waited spell bound, in hopes of her raising them again; <lb/>
              but when she continued to gaze upon the ground, he said, <lb/>
              “ Fair maiden, why waste the light of thine eyes upon <lb/>
              the earth, why not look up and let them dart fresh light <lb/>
              into mine ?"</p>
          <p>Upon hearing his voice, Leucippe burst into tears, and <lb/>
            appeared even more charming than before,! for tears give <lb/>
            permanency and increased expression to the eyes, either <lb/>
            rendering them more disagreeable, or improving them if pleas­ <lb/>
            ing, for in that case the dark iris, fading into a lighter hue, <lb/>
            resembles, when moistened with tears, the head of a gently- <lb/>
            bubbling fount; the white and black growing in brilliancy <lb/>
            from the moisture which floats over the surface, assume the <lb/>
            mingled shades of the violet and narcissus, and the eye <lb/>
            appears as smiling through the tears which are confined <lb/>
            within its lids. Such was the case with Leucippe; her <lb/>
            tears made her appear beautiful even in grief; and if after <lb/>
            trickling down they had congealed, the world would have <lb/>
            seen a species of amber hitherto unknown.‡ Tho sight of <lb/>
            her charms, heightened as they were by her grief inflamed, <lb/>
            Thersander; his own eyes filled with moisture. Tears na­ <lb/>
            turally awaken feelings of compassion, especially a woman's <lb/>
            tears, and the more so in proportion to the copiousness with <lb/>
            which they fall; and when she who weeps is beautiful and <lb/>
            he who beholds her is enamoured, he cannot avoid following <lb/>
            her example; the magic of her charms, which is chiefly in <note type="footnote"> * “ A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance; but by sorrow <lb/>
            of the heart, the spirit is broken.”—Pror. xv. 13. </note><note type="footnote"> † " As pearls from diamonds dropt. In brief, sorrow <lb/>

            her eyes, extends its influence to him; her beauty pene­ <lb/>
            trates into his soul, her tears draw forth his own, he might <lb/>
            dry them, but he purposely abstains from doing so, for he <lb/>
            would fain have them attract the notice of the fair one; he <lb/>
            even checks any motion of his eyelids, lest they should fall <lb/>
            before the time, sympathetic tears being the strongest proof <lb/>
            of love. This was the case with Thersander, he shed tears <lb/>
            partly because grief has really in it something which is <lb/>
            infectious, partly that he might appear to sympathize with <lb/>
            Leucippe's sorrow. "Pay her every attention which her <lb/>
            state of mind requires," said he in an under tone to Sos­ <lb/>
            thenes ; “ however unwillingly I will leave her for the pre­ <lb/>
            sent for fear of annoying her; when sibe is more composed <lb/>
            I will pay her another visit. Maiden," added he, addressing <lb/>
            her, “ cheer up, I will soon find means to dry those tears of <lb/>
            vours;" and whispering to Sosthenes, “ remember," said <lb/>
            he, “ that you promote my suit, and come to me to-morrow <lb/>
            morning,” with which words he left the cottage.</p>
          <p>While these things were taking place, Melitta had lost <lb/>
            no time in sending a young man into the country, who <lb/>
            was to bid Leucippe return without delay, as she had no <lb/>
            longer any need of ingredients for a philtre. Upon <lb/>
            his arrival, he found the female servants in great trouble <lb/>
            seeking for her everywhere, he therefore at once came <lb/>
            back and informed his mistress of what bad taken place. <lb/>
            Melitta, upon learning that Leucippe had disappeared, and <lb/>
            that I had been committed to prison, was thrown into <lb/>
            violent agitation: though ignorant of the whole truth her <lb/>
            suspicions fell upon Sosthenes, and being determined to <lb/>
            ascertain by means of Thersander where Leucippe was, she <lb/>
            had recourse to subtlety, combining with it a show of truth. <lb/>
            Upon Thersander coming home and shouting out, " So vou <lb/>
            have got your paramour set free and have smuggled him <lb/>
            out of the town ;-why did you not accompany him ? why <lb/>
            stop here ? why not take yourself off, and see how bu <lb/>
            looks now that lie is in 'durance vile?’ ”—“What para­ <lb/>
            mour?” replied Melitta with the greatest composure. <lb/>
            “ What delusion are you labouring under (-If you will <lb/>
            only calm your passion and listen to me, I will very soon <lb/>
            explain the truth; all I wish for on your part, is can­ <lb/>
            dour ; forget any slanderous reports which you have heard, <note type="footnote"> 2 u </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="466"/>
            let reason take the place of anger and listen to what I have <lb/>
            to say.—This young man is neither my paramour nor yet <lb/>
            my husband; he is a native of Phœnicia, and belongs to <lb/>
            one of the first families in Tyre; he was so unfortunate as <lb/>
            to suffer shipwreck and lost everything which he possessed. <lb/>
            Upon hearing of his misfortunes I took compassion upon <lb/>
            him (remembering what had befallen you), and received him <lb/>
            into my house.</p>
          <p>" Thersander," said It mentally, “ may perhaps be wan­ <lb/>
            dering about himself, some tender hearted female may have <lb/>
            taken pity upon him ; nay, if as report says, he has perished, <lb/>
            I will shew kindness to all who have experienced the perils <lb/>
            of the seal Many are the shipwrecked passengers to <lb/>
            whom I have shewn hospitality, to many a corpse washed <lb/>
            up by the waves have I here given burial; if I saw so much <lb/>
            as a plank from a vessel borne to land, I drew it up on <lb/>
            ,hore, for, I said, it may have belonged to the ship in <lb/>
            which Thersander sailed! This young man was one of the <lb/>
            last who was rescued from a watery grave, and in treating <lb/>
            him with kindness, I was in fact honouring you. Like <lb/>
            you, dearest, he had encountered the perils of the deep; in <lb/>
            turn therefore, I was paying regard to the impersonation of <lb/>
            your sufferings. You have now had laid before you the <lb/>
            motives by which I have been influenced.—I may add, that <lb/>
            he was in great sorrow for his wife; he had believed her <lb/>
            dead, but she was still alive, and, as he was informed, in the <lb/>
            power of Sosthenes our bailiff. The report proved true, for <lb/>
            upon proceeding into the country we found her there. It <lb/>
            is in your power to test the truth of what I say, you can <lb/>
            bring before you both Sosthenes and the female of whom I <lb/>
            speak ; if you can convict me of falsehood, then call me an <lb/>
            adultress.” Melitta spoke, all along, as if in ignorance of <lb/>
            Leucippe's disappearance, reserving to herself the power- <lb/>
            should Thersander wish to ascertain the truth-of bringing <lb/>
            forward the maid-servants who had accompanied Leucippe, <lb/>
            and who could solemnly declare that the maiden was <lb/>
            nowhere to be found. Her motive was to persuade Ther­ <lb/>
            sander of her own innocence, and it was for this purpose <lb/>
            that she urged him to bring forward Leucippe. To give <lb/>
            yet greater colour to her artful words, " Dearest husband," <lb/>
            she added, " during the time that we lived together, rou <lb/>

            have never discovered any blot in my character, neither <lb/>
            shall you do so now.* The report, at present raised <lb/>
            against me, has arisen from people being ignorant of the <lb/>
            cause which induced me to shew kindness to this young <lb/>
            man; rumour has been busy in your case, also; for you, <lb/>
            recollect, were reported to have perished. Now rumour <lb/>
            and calumny are two kindred evils, and the former may be <lb/>
            called the daughter of the latter. Calumny is sharper than <lb/>
            any sword-more burning than any fire, more pernicious <lb/>
            than any Siren, while rumour is more fluid than water, <lb/>
            swifter than the wind, fleeter than any wing of bird.† No <lb/>
            sooner has calumny shot forth a poisoned word than it flies <lb/>
            like an arrow and wounds, even in his absence, him against <lb/>
            whom it is directed; while whosoever hears this word is <lb/>
            readily persuaded, feels his anger kindled, and turns all its <lb/>
            violence against the victim. On the other hand, rumour <lb/>
            the offspring of this shot, flows onward like a torrent, and <lb/>
            floods the ears of every listener; words, like wind, speeding <lb/>
            it on its course, and,-to use another similitude-the wings <lb/>
            of the human tongue bearing it aloft and enabling it to <lb/>
            cleave the air.‡ These are the foes against whom I have <lb/>
            to contend, they have gained the mastery over your mind, <lb/>
            and have closed your ears against my words." Here she <lb/>
            paused, and taking his hand endeavoured to kiss it; her <lb/>
            plan was not without success, for Thersander became more <lb/>

            ing the account given of Leucippe to harmonize with what <lb/>
            he had heard from Sosthenes. His suspicions gave way, <lb/>
            however, only in part, for jealousy when once it has gained <lb/>
            entrance into the mind, is hard to be got rid of. The intel­ <lb/>
            ligence that the maiden was my wife annoyed him greatly, <lb/>
            and increased his animosity towards me; and saying that <lb/>
            he should enquire into the truth of what he bad heard, he <lb/>
            retired to rest alone.—Melitta, on her part was very much <lb/>
            distressed at being unable to perform her promise. Mean­ <lb/>
            while Sosthenes after the departure of Thersander (whom <lb/>
            he had encouraged with hopes of speedy success) again <lb/>
            went in to Leucippe, and assuming a joyful countenance, <lb/>
            “ Everything is going on satisfactorily Lacæna,” said he, <lb/>
            “Thersander is deeply enamoured of you, and very probably <lb/>
            will make you his wife; this success is entirely owing to <lb/>
            me, for I have extolled your beauty to the skies, and his <lb/>
            mind sees and thinks of you alone. Dry your tears there­ <lb/>
            fore, maiden, rise from the ground, sacrifice to Venus on <lb/>
            account of your good fortune, and do not forget how much <lb/>
            you owe to me." " May as much happiness befall you as you <lb/>
            have just announced to me," was her reply. “ Sosthenes, <lb/>
            believing that she spoke sincerely and not in irony, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded in a friendly tone and manner: " I will tell you more­ <lb/>
            over who Thersander is; he is the husband of Melitta whom <lb/>
            you lately saw, his family is one of the first in Ionia, his <lb/>
            wealth is even greater than his birth, but it is surpassed by <lb/>
            his kindness of disposition. I need not dwell upon his <lb/>
            age, for you have seen that he is still young and handsome, <lb/>
            two qualities especially acceptable to women."</p>
          <p>Leucippe could no longer endure listening to such non­ <lb/>
            sense : " Wicked wretch!" she exclaimed, " how much <lb/>
            longer do you mean to pollute my ears ? What is Ther­ <lb/>
            sander to me P Let his beauty delight his wife, his riches <lb/>
            benefit his country, and his good qualities be of service to <lb/>
            those who need them. What matters it to me, if he be <lb/>
            nobler in birth than Codrus, and surpass Crœsus in his <lb/>
            wealth P For what purpose should you enumerate another <lb/>
            man's good qualities to me ? Thersander shall receive my <lb/>
            praise, when he ceases wishing to do violence to another's wife. <lb/>
            Upon this, changing to a serious air, " Are you jesting, <lb/>
            maiden ? ” he asked. “What have I to do with jesting ?” <lb/>
             <pb n="469"/>
            Was hot reply. “Leave me to my own adverse fortune also <lb/>
            evil genius; I know full well that I have fallen into the <lb/>
            power of villains." " You must be incurably crazed," said <lb/>
            Sostbenes, " to talk thus. Is it like being in the power of <lb/>
            villains, to have the offer made to you of wealth, marriage, <lb/>
            and a luxurious life; to receive for your husband one so <lb/>
            favoured by the gods, that they have actually snatched him <lb/>
            from the jaws of death ?" And then he gave an account <lb/>
            of the shipwreck, magnifying Thersander's escape, and <lb/>
            making of it a greater wonder than of Arion and his <lb/>
            Dolphin.*</p>
          <p>When he bad finished his marvellous tale, and still Leu­ <lb/>
            cippe made no reply, “You had better consult your own <lb/>
            interest," he resumed, "and not talk in this fashion to <lb/>
            Thersander, lest you should provoke one who is actually <lb/>
            amiable; for when once kindled, his anger knows no bounds. <lb/>
            Kindness of heart, when it meets with a due return, in­ <lb/>
            creases, but when slighted, it soon changes into angry feel­ <lb/>
            ings ; and then the desire of taking vengeance is propor­ <lb/>
            tioned to the previous willingness of doing good." Leaving <lb/>
            Leucippe for a time, we will now speak of some of the other <lb/>
            characters in this tale. When Clinias and Satyrus learned <lb/>
            from Melitta that I had been incarcerated they imme­ <lb/>
            diately came to the prison, desirous of sharing my captivity; <lb/>
            the jailor, however, would not consent, but bid them at once <lb/>
            be gone, and though sorely disappointed there was no alter­ <lb/>
            native. They left me, therefore, after I had enjoined them <lb/>
            to bring me tidings of Leucippe in the morning; and I <lb/>
            remained alone, thinking of Melitta’s promise, and racked <lb/>
            by feelings of mingled fear and hope.</p>
          <p>The next day Sosthene3 proceeded according to his ap­ <lb/>
            ointment to Thersander, and my friends returned to me. <lb/>
            Thersander eagerly inquired whether any favourable impres­ <lb/>
            sion had been made upon Leucippe; Sosthenes replied <lb/>
            evasively, " She raises objections against receiving you, but <lb/>
            I scarcely believe her to be sincere in what she says; I <lb/>
            rather suspect that she fears you may desert her and expose <lb/>
            her to shame, after once enjoying her." " Let her dismiss <lb/>
            all such apprehensions," replied Thersander ; " my feelings <note type="footnote"> * See Herod. i. 23, 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            of love towards her are so ardent, that they will end only, <lb/>
            with my life.. One thing alone gives me uneasiness; A <lb/>
            am very anxious to know for certain whether, as Melitta <lb/>
            told me, she is the wife of the young man." Thus dis­ <lb/>
            coursing they came to the cottage where Leucippe was con­ <lb/>
            fined; when near the door they stopped and listened and <lb/>
            could hear her speaking to herself in a mournful voice. <lb/>
            “Alas ! alas! Clitopho, you know not where I am and in <lb/>
            what place I am detained; neither am I acquainted with <lb/>
            your present condition; and this mutual ignorance aug­ <lb/>
            ments our mutual grief. Can Thersander have surprised you <lb/>
            in his house P Can you have suffered any cruel treatment <lb/>
            at his hands? Often have I longed to question Sos­ <lb/>
            thenes about you, but I was at a loss what reason to assign ; <lb/>
            if I spoke of you as my husband, I feared that by pro­ <lb/>
            yoking the resentment of Thersander, I might produce evil <lb/>
            consequences to yourself; if I inquired after you as after a <lb/>
            mere stranger, it might have been said why do women <lb/>
            meddle with what in no way concerns them ? Often has <lb/>
            my tongue been on the point of speaking but has refused its <lb/>
            office. Often have I ended by saying to myself, ‘ Dear <lb/>
            Clitopbo, faithful husband of thy Leucippe, thou who couldst <lb/>
            share the couch of another woman, yet without enjoying <lb/>
            her, though I, in my jealousy doubted thy fidelity, could I <lb/>
            indeed behold thee again, after so long an interval, and yet <lb/>
            not snatch a single kiss!' What if Thersander comes again <lb/>
            to question me? Shall I throw off all disguise, and dis­ <lb/>
            close the plain unvarnished truth ? Suppose not, Ther­ <lb/>
            sander, that I am a sorry slave; I an daughter of the <lb/>
            Byzantian Commandant, wife of one foremost in rank <lb/>
            among the Tyrians. I am no Thessalian, neither am I called <lb/>
            Lacæna. No! this is the invention of pirate violence ; my <lb/>
            very name has been stolen from me! I am in reality <lb/>
            the wife of Clitopho, a native of Byzantium, the daughter <lb/>
            of Sostratus and Panthea. But, alas! Thersander would <lb/>
            give no credit to my words, or, if he did, my freedom of <lb/>
            speech might be the cause of injury to my best beloved! <note type="footnote"> *“ Wax to receive and marble to retain. <lb/>

            Who still become more constant as they cool.”—Byron. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="471"/>
            What then ? I will again assume the mask-and again <lb/>
            my name shall be Lacæna !” Thersander, retiring a little <lb/>
            from the door, said to Sosthenes, "Did you hear those <lb/>
            words of hers, unworthy of belief, indeed, as to their tenour, <lb/>
            but full of the spirit of love, and breathing grief and self <lb/>
            reproach P This adulterous rival of mine supplants me <lb/>
            everywhere; the villain must surely be a sorcerer; Melitta <lb/>
            loves, Leucippe doats upon him ;—would that I were <lb/>
            Clitopho !”</p>
          <p>" You must not show a faint heart, master," replied <lb/>
            Sosthenes; "you should go in at once and plead your suit; <lb/>
            the loves this worthless fellow, it is true; but only because <lb/>
            she has received addresses from no one else; you have but <lb/>
            to insinuate yourself into her good graces, and your supe­ <lb/>
            rior personal appearance will speedily gain the day and <lb/>
            banish him from her heart. A new lover soon drives out <lb/>
            the old. Women love the individual while present and <lb/>
            remember him when absent until another is found to take <lb/>
            his place; then he is soon blotted from their recollection." <lb/>
            Thersander now felt emboldened, for one readily believes <lb/>
            words which flatter with a prospect of success; and desire, <lb/>
            by dwelling upon its object, is sure to beget sanguine hope. <lb/>
            After waiting a short time therefore, that he might not <lb/>
            seem to have overheard her works, he put on what he hoped <lb/>
            would appear an engaging air, and entered the cottage.</p>
          <p>The sight of Leucippe inflamed his mind ; she appeared <lb/>
            more charming then ever, and her presence acted as fuel to <lb/>
            the fire of love which had been burning in his breast all <lb/>
            night. He with difficulty restrained himself from at once <lb/>
            folding her in his arms, and sitting down beside her, began <lb/>
            to talk of various unconnected trifles, as lovers are wont to <lb/>
            do when in the company of their mistresses. At such times <lb/>
            the soul is centred upon the object of its love, reason no <lb/>
            longer guides their speech, and the tongue mechanically <lb/>
            utters words.. In the course of his address, he put his arm <lb/>
            round her neck with the view of kissing her, and she aware <lb/>
            of his intention hung down her head upon her bosom ; he <lb/>
            used all his endeavours to raise her face, and she with equal <lb/>
            perseverance continued to conceal it the more and more <note type="footnote"> * “ And on the thought my words broke forth. <lb/>
            All incoherent as they were.”—Byron. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            when this mutual struggle had continued for some time, <lb/>
            Thersander, under the influence of amorous obstinacy, <lb/>
            slipped his left hand under her chin, and seizing her hair <lb/>
            with his right, compelled her to raise her head. When at <lb/>
            length, he gave over, either from succeeding in his object, <lb/>
            or failing, or from being weary of the sport, Leucippe said to <lb/>
            him indignantly, " Your conduct is unfitting and ungentle­ <lb/>
            manly, though fit enough for the slave Sosthenes; the <lb/>
            master and his man are worthy of each other; but spare <lb/>
            yourself any farther trouble, you will never succeed unless <lb/>
            you become a second Clitopho."</p>
          <p>Distracted between anger and desire, Thersander was at <lb/>
            a loss what to do. These passions are like two fires in the <lb/>
            soul; they differ in nature, but resemble each other in in­ <lb/>
            tensity ; the former urges to hatred, the latter to love; the <lb/>
            sources also of their respective flames are near to one <lb/>
            another, anger having its seat in the heart,. the liver being <lb/>
            the abode of love.† When, therefore, a person is attacked <lb/>
            by these two passions, his soul becomes the scales in which <lb/>
            the intensity of either flame is weighed. Each tries to <lb/>
            depress its respective scale, and love, when it obtains its <lb/>
            object is generally successful; but should it be slighted, <lb/>
            then it summons its neighbour, anger, to its aid, and both <lb/>
            of them combine their flame. When once anger has gained <lb/>
            the mastery, and has driven love from its seat, being impla­ <lb/>
            cable by nature, instead of assisting it to gain its end, it <lb/>
            rules like a tyrant, and will not allow it (however anxious) <lb/>
            to become reconciled with its beloved. Pressed down by <lb/>
            the weight of anger, love is no longer free, and vainly <lb/>
            endeavours to recover its dominion, and so is compelled to <lb/>
            hate what once it doated upon. But, again, when the <lb/>
            tempest of anger has reached its height, and its fury has <lb/>
            frothed away, it becomes weary from satiety, and its efforts <lb/>
            cease; then love, armed by desire, revives, comes to the <lb/>
            rescue, and attacks anger sleeping on his post; and calling <figure type="illustration">

              to mind the injuries done to the beloved during its frenzy, <lb/>
              it grieves and sues for pardon, and invites to reconciliation, <lb/>
              and promises to make amends in future. If after this it <lb/>
              meets with full success, then it continues to be all smiles <lb/>
              and gentleness; but if again repulsed and scorned, then its <lb/>
              old neighbour, anger, is once more called in, who revives <lb/>
              his slumbering fires, and regains his former power. Ther­ <lb/>
              sander, so long as he was buoyed up with hopes of succeed­ <lb/>
              ing in his suit, had been Leucippe's humble servant; but <lb/>
              when he found all his expectations dashed to the ground, <lb/>
              love gave way to wrath, and he smote her upon the face. <lb/>
              “ Wretched slave!" he exclaimed, “ I have heard your <lb/>
              love-sick lamentations, and know all; instead of taking it <lb/>
              as a compliment that I should speak to you, and regarding <lb/>
              a kiss from your master as an honour, you must, forsooth, <lb/>
              coquet and give yourself airs.; for my part, I believe you <lb/>
              to be a strumpet, for an adulterer is your love ! However, <lb/>
              since you refuse to accept me as a lover, you shall feel my <lb/>
              power as a master."</p>
          <p>Leucippe meekly replied, " Use me as harshly as you <lb/>
            please; I will submit to everything except the loss ot <lb/>
            chastity," and turning to Sosthenes, "you can bear witness <lb/>
            to my powers of endurance; for I have received at your <lb/>
            hands harder measure even than this!" Ashamed at having <lb/>
            his conduct brought to light, "This wench," said he, <lb/>
            " deserves to be flayed with the scourge and to be put upon <lb/>
            the rack, in order to teach her better manners towards her <lb/>
            master."</p>
          <p>" By all means follow his advice !” resumed Leucippe to <lb/>
            Thersander, “ he gives good counsel; do the worst which <lb/>
            your malice can suggest ;-extend my hands upon the <lb/>
            wheel;t bare my back to the scourge; burn my body in <lb/>

              crown of all (for this would be but trifling commendation), <lb/>

          <p>THE scornful reproaches of Leucippe stirred up a tumult <lb/>
            of conflicting passions in Thersander's mind; be was in. <lb/>
            censed by her taunts, vexed at his ill success, and perplexed <lb/>
            how to secure the accomplishment of his desires. Without <lb/>
            saying another word he rushed out of the house to give vent <lb/>
            to the storm and tempest of his soul.- Shortly after, having <lb/>
            conferred with Sosthenes, he went to the jailor, and endea­ <lb/>
            voured to persuade him to administer a dose of poison to <lb/>
            me ; this, however, the jailor refused to do, his predecessor <lb/>
            having suffered death for taking off a prisoner in this man­ <lb/>
            ner. Failing in this, he obtained his consent to introduce <lb/>
            a man (who was to pass for a criminal) into my cell, under <lb/>
            pretence of wishing to extract some secrets out of me <lb/>
            through him. The man had been previously tutored by <lb/>
            Thersander, and was casually to introduce Leucippe's name, <lb/>
            and to say that she had been murdered by the contrivance <lb/>
            of Melitta. Thersander's object in persuading me of her <lb/>
            death was to hinder me (in case I obtained a verdict of <lb/>
            acquittal) from instituting any further search for her reco­ <lb/>
            very, and the name of Melitta was introduced in order <lb/>
            that, after learning Leucippe's death, I might not entertain <lb/>
            any thoughts of marrying her, and so by settling at Ephesus <lb/>
            might interrupt Thersander in the prosecution of his schemes, <lb/>
            but, on the contrary, might be induced to quit the city <lb/>
            without delay, from hatred to Melitta for having contrived <lb/>
            the death of my beloved.</p>
          <p>As soon as this fellow came near me, he began to play <lb/>
            his appointed part, and with a knavish groan† exclaimed, <lb/>
            " Alackaday! what a miserable thing is life! There is no <lb/>

              Would I could have guessed the character of my fellow. <lb/>
              traveller, and what work he had been engaged in!” This, <lb/>
              and much more of the same sort, he said speaking to himself <lb/>
              craftily endeavouring to attract my attention, and to make <lb/>
              me inquire what it was that ailed him. He did not succeed, <lb/>
              however, for I was sufficiently taken up with my own <lb/>
              troubles, and he went on with his groans and ejaculations. <lb/>
              At length—for the unfortunate take pleasure in listening <lb/>
              to another's griefs, finding in it a kind of medicine for their <lb/>
              sorrows—one of the prisoners asked, “ What trick has the <lb/>
              jade Fortune been playing you ? I suspect that, like my­ <lb/>
              self, the has laid you up in limbo without deserving it." <lb/>
              He then proceeded to tell his own story, giving an account <lb/>
              of what had brought him into prison; and having finished, <lb/>
              requested the other to favour him with the particulars of <lb/>
              his own misfortune. He of course readily complied.</p>
          <p>" I left the city yesterday," said he, “ to go towards <lb/>
            Smyrna, and had proceeded about half a mile, when I was <lb/>
            joined by a young man out of the country. He saluted <lb/>
            me, and after walking with me for a few minutes, inquired <lb/>
            whither I was going. I told him, and he said that luckily <lb/>
            his road lay in the same direction, so that we proceeded in <lb/>
            company, and entered into conversation. Stopping at an <lb/>
            inn, we ordered dinner, and presently four men came in <lb/>
            and did the same. Instead of eating, however, they con­ <lb/>
            tinued watching us, and making signs to one another. <lb/>
            I plainly enough saw that we were the objects of their <lb/>
            notice, but was wholly at a loss to understand the meaning <lb/>
            of their gestures. My companion gradually turned very <lb/>
            pale, left off eating, and at last began to tremble all over. <lb/>
            Instantly they sprang up, seized, and bound us; one of <lb/>
            them also dealt him a violent blow upon the face; upon <lb/>
            which, as if he had been already on the rack, and even <lb/>
            without a question being asked him he cried out, ‘I admit <lb/>
            having killed the girl! Melitta, Thersander's wife, hired <lb/>
            me to do the deed, and gave me a hundred gold pieces for <lb/>
            my trouble ; here they are every one-take them for your­ <lb/>
            selves ; and for heaven's sake let me off!’”</p>
          <p>Upon hearing these names I started as if stung, and turning <lb/>
            to him, “ Who is Melitta ?" I asked.—“ She is a lady of the <lb/>
            first rank in this city," was his reply. " She took a fancy <lb/>
             <pb n="477"/>
            to a young man, said to be a native of Tyre; he found a <lb/>
            favourite wench of his (whom he had given up for lost), <lb/>
            among the number of Melitta's slaves, and the, moved by <lb/>
            jealousy, had the girl seized by the fellow whom ill luck <lb/>
            made my fellow-traveller, and he, in obedience to Melitta's <lb/>
            orders, hasmade away with her.-But to return to my own <lb/>
            story. I, who had never seen the man before, nor had <lb/>
            dealings with him of any kind, was dragged along with <lb/>
            him, bound, as an accomplice in his crime; but what is <lb/>
            harder than all, they had not gone far, before, for tho sake <lb/>
            of his hundred pieces, they let him go, but kept me in <lb/>
            custody and carried me before the judge."</p>
          <p>Upon hearing this chapter of accidents, I neither uttered <lb/>
            a sound nor shed a tear, for both voice and tears refused <lb/>
            their office, but a general trembling seized me, my heart <lb/>
            sunk within me, and I felt as at the point of death. After <lb/>
            a time, recovering in some degree from the stupor which <lb/>
            his words had caused, " How did the ruffian despatch her?" <lb/>
            I asked, " and what has become of her body ?" But <lb/>
            having now performed the business for which he was <lb/>
            employed, by stimulating my curiosity, he became obsti­ <lb/>
            nately silent, and I could extract nothing more from him. <lb/>
            In answer to my repeated questions, " Do you think," said <lb/>
            he, at length, "that I had a hand in the murder? The <lb/>
            man told me he had killed her ; he said nothing of the <lb/>
            place and manner of her death." Tears now came to my <lb/>
            relief, and I gave full vent to my sorrow. It is with mental <lb/>
            wounds as with bodily hurts ; when one has been stricken <lb/>
            in body some time elapses before the livid bruise, the result <lb/>
            of the blow is seen; and so also any one who has been <lb/>
            pierced by the sharp tusk of a boar, looks for the wound, <lb/>
            but without immediately discovering it, owing to its being <lb/>
            deeply seated ; but presently a white line is perceived, the <lb/>
            precursor of the blood, which speedily begins to flow ; in <lb/>
            like manner, no sooner have bitter tidings been announced, <lb/>
            than they pierce the soul, but the suddenness of the stroke <lb/>
            prevents the wound from being visible at once, and the <lb/>
            tooth of sorrow must for some space have gnawed the heart <lb/>
            ere a vent is found for tears, which are to the mind what <lb/>
            blood is to the body.</p>
          <p>It was thus with me ; the arrows of grief inflicted an <lb/>
             <pb n="478"/>
            instant wound, but their result was imperceptible until the <lb/>
            soul had leisure to vent itself in tears and lamentations. <lb/>
            Then, indeed, I exclaimed, " What evil genius has deluded <lb/>
            me with this brief gleam of joy, and has shewn me my <lb/>
            Leucippe only to lay a foundation for fresh calamities ? All <lb/>
            that has been allowed me was to see her, and I have not <lb/>
            been permitted to satiate even the sense of sight! My <lb/>
            pleasure has, indeed, been like the baseless fabric of a <lb/>
            dream. 0 my Leucippe, how often hast thou been lost to <lb/>
            me? Am I never to cease from tears and lamentations? <lb/>
            Is one death perpetually to succeed another ? On former <lb/>
            occasions Fortune has been merely jesting with me, but now <lb/>
            she is in earnest! In those former imaginary deaths of <lb/>
            thine, some consolation, at least, was afforded me, for thy <lb/>
            body, wholly or in part, was left at my disposal! But now <lb/>
            thou art snatched away both in soul and body! Twice hast <lb/>
            thou escaped the pirates, but Melitta, more fell than any <lb/>
            pirate, has had thee done to death. And I, impious and <lb/>
            unholy that I am, have actually kissed thy murderess, have <lb/>
            been enfolded in her accursed embrace, and she has anti­ <lb/>
            cipated thee in receiving from me the offerings of Love!” <lb/>
            While thus plunged in grief, Clinias came to visit me. I <lb/>
            related every particular to him, and declared my deter­ <lb/>
            mination of putting an end to my existence. lie did all in <lb/>
            his power to console me. “ Consider," he said, " how often <lb/>
            she has died and come to life again; who knows but what <lb/>
            she may do the same on this occasion also ? Why be in <lb/>
            such haste to kill yourself P You will have abundant leisure <lb/>
            when the tidings of her death have been positively con­ <lb/>
            firmed."</p>
          <p>" This is mere trifling," I replied ; " there is small need <lb/>
            of confirmation; my resolve is fixed, and I have decided <lb/>
            upon a manner of death which will not permit even the <lb/>
            hated Melitta to escape unscathed. Listen to my plan <lb/>
            In case of being summoned into court- it was my intention <lb/>
            to plead not guilty. I have now changed my determina­ <lb/>
            tion, and shall plead guilty, confessing the intrigue between <lb/>
            Melitta and myself, and saying that we mutually planned <lb/>
            Leucippe's death ; by this means she will suffer the punish­ <figure type="illustration">

              ment which is her duo, and I shall quit this life which I so <lb/>
              much detest.”—“Talk not thus," replied he; it can you <lb/>
              endure to die under the base imputation of being a mur­ <lb/>
              derer, and, what is more, the murderer of Leucippe pit....;. <lb/>
              “ Nothing is base," replied I, “ by which we can wreak <lb/>
              vengeance upon our enemies.”* While we were engaged in <lb/>
              Argument, the fellow who had communicated the tidings of <lb/>
              the fictitious maiden was removed, upon pretence of being <lb/>
              taken before the magistrate to undergo an examination. <lb/>
              Clinias and Satyrus exerted themselves, but ineffectually, <lb/>
              in order to persuade me to alter my resolution; and on the <lb/>
              same day they removed into lodgings, so as to be no longer <lb/>
              under the roof of Melitta's foster-brother. The following <lb/>
              day the case came on ; Thersander bad a great muster† of <lb/>
              friends and partisans, and had engaged ten advocates; and <lb/>
              Melitta had been equally on the alert in preparing for her <lb/>
              defence. When the counsel on either side had finished <lb/>
              speaking, I asked leave to address the court, and said, <lb/>
              " All those who have been exerting their eloquence, either <lb/>
              for Thersander or for Melitta, have been giving utterance to <lb/>
              sheer nonsense ; I will reveal the whole truth, and nothing <lb/>
              but the truth. I was once passionately in love with a <lb/>
              female of Byzantium named Leucippe; she was carried oft <lb/>
              by pirates, and I had reason to believe that she was dead. <lb/>
              Meeting with Melitta in Egypt, we formed a connexion, <lb/>
              and after some time we travelled together to this city, <lb/>
              and Leucippe, whom I just now mentioned, was found <lb/>
              working as a slave upon Thersander's estate, under his <lb/>
              bailiff, Sosthenes. By what means he obtained possession <lb/>
              of a free-born female, and what were his dealings with the <lb/>
              pirates I leave it to you to guess.</p>
          <p>" Melitta, finding that I had recovered my former mis­ <lb/>
            tress, became apprehensive of her regaining her influence <lb/>
            over my affections, and contrived a plan for putting her to <lb/>
            death. I entered into her schemes,-for what avails it to <lb/>
            conceal the truth?—having received a promise that she <figure type="illustration">

              would settle all her property upon me; a man was found, <lb/>
              who, for the reward of a hundred gold pieces, undertook <lb/>
              the business. When the deed was done, he fled, and is <lb/>
              now somewhere in concealment. As for myself, Love was <lb/>
              not long in taking vengeance upon my cruelty. No sooner <lb/>
              did I hear of the murder being perpetrated, than I bitterly <lb/>
              repented of what had taken place, and all my former fond­ <lb/>
              ness revived. For this reason I have determined to turn <lb/>
              evidence against myself, in order that you may send me <lb/>
              whither she is gone to whom I am still so deeply attached. <lb/>
              Life is intolerable to one who, in addition to being a <lb/>
              murderer, loves her of whose death he has been the cause."</p>
          <p>Every one in court was utterly astounded at the unex­ <lb/>
            pected tenour of my speech, especially Melitta. The advo­ <lb/>
            cates of Thersander already claimed a triumph,! while <lb/>
            those engaged in Melitta's behalf anxiously questioned her <lb/>
            as to the truth of what I had said. She was in great <lb/>
            confusion; denied some points, virtually admitted others, <lb/>
            confessed to having known Leucippe, and indeed confirmed <lb/>
            most of what I had said, with the exception of the murder. <lb/>
            This general agreement on her part with the facts advanced <lb/>
            by me, created a suspicion against her, even in the minds of <lb/>
            her own counsel, and they were at a loss what line of defence <lb/>
            to adopt on her behalf. At this critical juncture, while the <lb/>
            court was being a scene of great clamour, Clinias came <lb/>
            forward and requested to be heard, for " Remember," said <lb/>
            he, It a man's life is now in jeopardy." Obtaining permis­ <lb/>
            sion to speak, "Men of Ephesus!" he began, (his eyes <lb/>
            filling with tears,) " do not precipitately condemn to die <lb/>
            one who eagerly longs for death, the natural refuge of the <lb/>
            unfortunate. He has been calumniating himself, and has <lb/>
            taken upon him the guilt of others. Let me briefly ac­ <lb/>
            quaint you with what has befallen him. What he has said <lb/>
            respecting his mistress, her being carried off by pirates, <lb/>
            about Sosthenes, and other circumstances which happened <lb/>
            before the pretended murder, are strictly true. The young <lb/>
            woman has undoubtedly disappeared; but whether she is <lb/>
            still alive, or has been made away with, it is impossible to <lb/>
            say ; one thing is certain, that Sosthenes conceived a <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig129.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="481"/>
              passion for her, that he used her cruelly for not consenting <lb/>
              to his desires, and that he was leagued with pirates. My <lb/>
              friend believing her to be murdered, is disgusted with life, <lb/>
              and has, therefore invented this charge against himself; <lb/>
              be has already confessed with his own mouth that he is <lb/>
              anxious to die owing to grief at the loss which he has <lb/>
              sustained. Consider, I pray you, whether it is likely that <lb/>
              one who is really a murderer would be so desirous of dying <lb/>
              with his victim, and would feel life so insupportable. When <lb/>
              do we ever find murderers so tender-hearted, and hatred <lb/>
              so compassionate ? In the name of the gods, therefore, do <lb/>
              not believe his words ; do not condemn to death a man who <lb/>
              is much more deserving of commiseration than of punish­ <lb/>
              ment. If, as he says, he really planned this murder, let <lb/>
              him bring forward the hired assassin; let him declare what <lb/>
              has become of the body. If neither the one nor the other <lb/>
              can be produced, how can any belief be attached to such a <lb/>
              murder ? ‘I was in love with Melitta,’ he says, ' and <lb/>
              therefore I caused Leucippe to be killed!’ How comes be <lb/>
              to implicate Melitta, the object of his affection, and to be <lb/>
              so desirous of dying for Leucippe, whose death he com­ <lb/>
              passed ? Is it usual for persons to hate the object of their <lb/>
              love, and to love the object of their hatred ? Is it not <lb/>
              much more probable that in such circumstances he would <lb/>
              have denied the crime (even had it been brought home to <lb/>
              hi in) in order to save his mistress, instead of throwing <lb/>
              away his own life afterwards, owing to a vain regret for her <lb/>
              loss ? What can possibly, therefore, be his motive for <lb/>
              charging Melitta with a crime of which she is not guilty ? <lb/>
              I will tell you, and in so doing do not suppose that I have <lb/>
              any desire of inculpating this lady,—my sole wish is to <lb/>
              make you acquainted with the real truth.</p>
          <p>" Before this sea-faring husband of hers came to life again <lb/>
            so suddenly, Melitta took a violent fancy to this young <lb/>
            man, and proposed marriage to him ; he on his part was not <lb/>
            at all disposed to comply with her wishes, and his repug­ <lb/>
            nance became yet greater when he discovered that his <lb/>
            mistress, whom he had imagined dead, was in slavery, <lb/>
            under the power of Sosthenes. Until aware who she was, <lb/>
            Melitta, taking pity upon her, had caused her to be set <lb/>
            at liberty, had received her into her own house, and treated <note type="footnote"> 2 i </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="482"/>
            her with the consideration due to a gentlewoman in dis­ <lb/>
            tress; but after becoming acquainted with her story, she <lb/>
            was sent back into the country, and she has not been heard <lb/>
            of since. The truth of what I say can be attested by <lb/>
            Melitta herself and the two maids in whose company she <lb/>
            was sent away. This was one thing which excited sus­ <lb/>
            picions in my friend's mind that Leucippe had been foully <lb/>
            dealt with through her rival's jealousy; a circumstance <lb/>
            which took place after he was in prison confirmed these <lb/>
            suspicions, and has had the effect of exasperating him not <lb/>
            only against Melitta but against himself, One of the <lb/>
            prisoners, in the course of lamenting his own troubles, <lb/>
            mentioned that he had unwittingly fallen into the company <lb/>
            of a man who had committed murder for the sake of gold; <lb/>
            the victim was named Leucippe, and the crime, he said, had <lb/>
            been committed at the instigation of Melitta. Of course <lb/>
            I cannot say whether this be true or not, it is for you to <lb/>
            institute inquiries. You can produce the prisoner who <lb/>
            made mention of the hired assassin; Sosthenes, who can <lb/>
            declare from whom he purchased Leucippe, and the maids, <lb/>
            who can explain her disappearance. Before you have <lb/>
            thoroughly investigated each of these particulars, it is con­ <lb/>
            trary to all law, whether human or divine, to pass sentence <lb/>
            upon this unfortunate young man, on the bare evidence of <lb/>
            his frenzied words, for there can be no doubt that the <lb/>
            violence of his grief has affected his intellect."</p>
          <p>The arguments of Clinias appeared just and reasonable <lb/>
            to many of those present, but Thersander's counsel, toge­ <lb/>
            ther with his friends, called out that sentence of death <lb/>
            ought to be pronounced without delay upon the murderer <lb/>
            who, by the providence of the gods, had been made his own <lb/>
            accuser. Melitta brought forward her maids, and required <lb/>
            Thersander to produce Sosthenes, who might probably turn <lb/>
            out to be the murderer. This was the challenge. mainly <lb/>
            insisted upon by her counsel. Thersander, in great alarm, <lb/>
            secretly despatched one of his dependants into the country, <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόκλησιν</foreign>, a formal challenge proposed by a party to his oppo­ <lb/>
            nent that the decision of a disputed point should be determined by <lb/>
            the evidence of a third party. One of the most common was the <lb/>
            demand or offer to examine by torture a slave supposed to be cognizant <lb/>
            of the matter in dispute.-See Diet. of Grk. and Roman Antiq. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="483"/>
            With orders to Sostratus to get out of the way at once, <lb/>
            before the arrival of those who were about to be sent after <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Mounting a horse without delay, the messenger rode full <lb/>
            speed to inform the bailiff of the danger he ran of being <lb/>
            put to the torture, if taken. Sosthenes was at that moment <lb/>
            with Leucippe, doing his best to soothe her irritated feel­ <lb/>
            ings. Hearing himself summoned in a loud voice, he came <lb/>
            out of the cottage; and, upon learning the state of matters, <lb/>
            overcome with tear, and thinking the officers were already <lb/>
            at his heels, he got upon the horse, and rode off towards <lb/>
            Smyrna ; after which the messenger returned to his master. <lb/>
            It is a true saying that fear drives away the power of recol­ <lb/>
            lection, for Sosthenes in his alarm for his own safety was so <lb/>
            forgetful of everything else, that he neglected to secure the <lb/>
            door of Leucippe's cottage. Indeed slaves, generally speak­ <lb/>
            ing, when frightened, run into the very excess of cowardice. <lb/>
            Melitta's advocates having given the above-mentioned <lb/>
            challenge, Thersander came forward and said, “ We have <lb/>
            now surely had quite enough of this man's silly stories; <lb/>
            and I cannot but feel surprised at your want of sense, who, <lb/>
            after convicting a murderer upon the strongest possible <lb/>
            evidence, his own admission of his guilt, do not at once <lb/>
            pass sentence of death upon him ; whereas, instead of doing <lb/>
            this, you suffer yourselves to be imposed upon by his <lb/>
            plausible words and tears. For my part I believe him <lb/>
            actuated by personal fears, and to be an accomplice in the <lb/>
            murder; nor can I see what possible need there can be for <lb/>
            having recourse to the rack in a matter so clear already. <lb/>
            Nay, more, I fully believe him to have had a hand in <lb/>
            another murder; for three days have now elapsed since I <lb/>
            saw Sosthenes, the man whom they call upon me to bring <lb/>
            forward; it is not at all improbable that this is owing to <lb/>
            their contrivance, since it was he who informed me of the <lb/>
            act of adultery which has taken place, and having put him <lb/>
            to death, they now craftily call upon me to produce the <lb/>
            man, knowing it to be out of my power to do so. But <lb/>
            even supposing he were alive and present, what difference <lb/>
            could it make ? What questions would he put to him ? <lb/>
            'Did he ever purchase a certain female?’—‘Yes.’ a Was <lb/>
            this female in the power of Melitta ?’—‘ Yes.' Here would <note type="footnote"> 212 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="484"/>
            be an end of the examination, and Sosthenes would be <lb/>
            dismissed. Let me now, however, address myself to Cli­ <lb/>
            topho and Melitta.</p>
          <p>" What have you done, I ask, with my slave ?-for a slave <lb/>
            of mine she assuredly was, having been purchased by <lb/>
            Sosthenes, and were she still alive, instead of having been <lb/>
            murdered by them, my slave she would still be." Ther­ <lb/>
            sander said this from mingled malice and cunning, in order <lb/>
            that if Leucippe should turn out to be still alive, he might <lb/>
            detain her in a state of servitude. lie then continued:­ <lb/>
            “ Clitopho confessed that he killed her, he has therefore <lb/>
            pronounced judgment upon himself. Melitta, on the other <lb/>
            hand, denies the crime-her maids may be brought forward <lb/>
            and tortured in order to refute what she says. If it should <lb/>
            appear that they received the young woman from her, but <lb/>
            have not brought her back again, the question will arise, <lb/>
            What has become of her ? Why was she sent away ? And <lb/>
            to whom was she sent ? Is it not self-evident that some <lb/>
            persons had been hired to commit the murder, and that the <lb/>
            maids were kept in ignorance of this, lest a number of <lb/>
            witnesses might render discovery more probable ? No doubt <lb/>
            they left her at some spot where a gang of ruffians were <lb/>
            lying in concealment, so that it was out of their power to <lb/>
            witness what took place. He has also trumped up some <lb/>
            story about a prisoner who made mention of the murder. <lb/>
            I should like to know who this prisoner is, who has not said <lb/>
            a word on the subject to the chief magistrate, but has com­ <lb/>
            municated, it seems, every particular to him, except the <lb/>
            name of his informer. Again, I ask, will you not make an <lb/>
            end of listening to such foolery, and taking any interest <lb/>
            in such transparent absurdities ? Can you imagine that he <lb/>
            would have turned a self-accuser without the intervention <lb/>
            of the deity ?" Thersander, after speaking to this effect, <lb/>
            concluded by solemnly swearing that he was ignorant what <lb/>
            had become of Sosthenes.</p>
          <p>The presiding judge, who was of royal extraction,. and <note type="footnote"> # The events of this romance are supposed to take place when <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προέδρος</foreign> to be of royal extraction, probably because cases of blood were <lb/>

            who took cognizance of cases of blood, had, in accordance <lb/>
            with the law, a certain number of assessors,* men of mature <lb/>
            age, whose province it was to assist him in judicial inves­ <lb/>
            tigations. After conferring with them, he determined to <lb/>
            pronounce sentence of death upon me, agreeably to a law <lb/>
            which awarded capital punishment to any one standing <lb/>
            convicted upon his own accusation. Melitta was to have a <lb/>
            second trial, and her maids were to be examined by torture, <lb/>
            Thersander was to register his oath, declaratory of his <lb/>
            ignorance as to Sosthenes. I, as already condemned to <lb/>
            death, was to be tortured- in order to make me confess <lb/>
            whether Melitta was privy to the murder. Already was I <lb/>
            bound, stripped, and suspended aloft by ropes, while some <lb/>
            were bringing scourges, others the fire and the wheel, and <lb/>
            Clinias was lamenting loudly, and calling upon the gods, <lb/>
            when lo! the priest of Diana crowned with laurel, was <lb/>
            beheld approaching: the sign of a sacred embassy coming <lb/>
            to offer sacrifices to the goddess. In such cases there is <lb/>
            suspension! of all judicial punishments during the days <lb/>
            occupied in the performance of the sacrifice, and in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of this I was released. The chief of the sacred <lb/>
            embassy was no other than Leucippe's father. Diana had <lb/>
            appeared to the Byzantians, and had secured them victory <lb/>
            in the war against the Thracians, in consequence of which <lb/>
            they felt bound to send her a sacrifice in token of their <lb/>
            gratitude. In addition to this, the goddess had appeared <lb/>
            to Sostratus himself at night, signifying to him that he <lb/>
            would find his daughter and his nephew at Ephosus. Just <lb/>
            about this time, Leucippe perceived the door of the cottage <lb/>
            to be left open; and as, after a careful examination, Sos­ <lb/>
            thenes was nowhere to be seen, her usual presence of mind <lb/>
            and sanguine hopes returned. She remembered how often, <lb/>
            contrary to all expectation, she had been preserved, and the <lb/>
            thought of this gave her increased boldness. Fortune <note type="footnote"> * Each of the three superior arch on a was at liberty to have two <lb/>

            moreover favoured her, since the temple of Diana was near <lb/>
            the spot. Accordingly, hurrying thither, she sought refuge <lb/>
            within its precincts. The temple afforded sanctuary to <lb/>
            men and virgins,-an other woman incurred death by <lb/>
            entering it, unless she happened to be a slave who had some <lb/>
            cause of complaint against her master; in which case she <lb/>
            was permitted to take refuge there, and the matter was <lb/>
            submitted to the decision of the magistrates; supposing the <lb/>
            master was acquitted, he took back his slave, being bound <lb/>
            by oath to bear her no ill will on account of her having run <lb/>
            away; but if, on the contrary, the slave was proved to have <lb/>
            justice on her side, she remained in the temple, and was <lb/>
            employed in the service of the goddess. Leucippe arrived <lb/>
            at the temple just at the time when Sostratus was conduct­ <lb/>
            ing the priest to the scene of the trial, in order to suspend <lb/>
            the proceedings, and was very near encountering her <lb/>
            father.</p>
          <p>When I was set free, the court broke up, and I was <lb/>
            surrounded by a concourse of people, some pitying me, <lb/>
            some calling upon the gods in my behalf, others question­ <lb/>
            ing me. Sostratus, coming by at the time, no sooner saw <lb/>
            than he recognized me; for, as I before mentioned, he had <lb/>
            formerly been at Tyre upon the occasion of a festival of <lb/>
            Hercules, and had passed a considerable time there before <lb/>
            the period of our flight. He at once knew me, and the <lb/>
            more readily because his dream had led him to expect that <lb/>
            be should find me and his daughter there. Coming up to <lb/>
            me, therefore, " Do I see Clitopho ?" said he ; " and where <lb/>
            is Leucippe ?" Instantly recognizing him, I cast my eyes <lb/>
            to the ground and remained silent, while the bystanders <lb/>
            related to him every particular relative to my self-accusa­ <lb/>
            tion. He no sooner heard what they had to say than with <lb/>
            an ejaculation of bitter grief, and smiting his head he made <lb/>
            a rush at me, and was very near pulling out my eyes, for I <lb/>
            remained altogether passive and offered no resistance to his <lb/>
            violence. At length Clinias coming forward, checked his <lb/>
            fury, and endeavoured to pacify him. " What are you <lb/>
            about ?" said he : “ why are you venting your wrath against <lb/>
            him; he loves Leucippe more dearly than you do, for he has <lb/>
            courted death from belief that she was no longer in exis­ <lb/>
            tence and he added a great deal more in order to calm his <lb/>
             <pb n="489"/>
            appetite for men P" Exasperated by this language, and not <lb/>
            enduring to hear her called a slave and accused of lewdness, <lb/>
            I interrupted him, “You are trebly a slave* yourself, and <lb/>
            the rankest lecher who ever existed, whereas she is free <lb/>
            born, and pure and worthy of her guardian goddess ?”— <lb/>
            " Dare you vent your insolence on me, convicted felon <lb/>
            that you are ?” exclaimed he, accompanying his words with <lb/>
            a couple of blows, which, given with all his might, caused <lb/>
            the blood to flow from my nose in streams; in his haste to <lb/>
            deal me a third, he struck me on the mouth, and my teeth <lb/>
            inflicting a severe wound upon his fingers avenged the <lb/>
            insult offered to my nostrils. Uttering a cry of pain, he <lb/>
            drew back his hand, and did not offer any further violence; <lb/>
            while, pretending not to notice that he was hurt, I filled the <lb/>

            “Whither,” I exclaimed, "shall we henceforth flee to <lb/>
            escape the hands of violence ? Where shall we seek <lb/>
            sanctuary, if Diana is despised ? Lo! I have been at­ <lb/>

            only in some howling wilderness, with no human witness to <lb/>
            behold them; but you—abandoned wretch that you are! <lb/>
            -exercise your brutality in the very presence of the gods! <lb/>
            Temples are wont to afford an asylum, even to the guilty; <lb/>
            but I, who am wholly innocent and a suppliant of the god­ <lb/>
            dess, have suffered violence before the altar,—nay, before <lb/>
            the eyes of the goddess! The blows inflicted on me have <lb/>
            virtually fallen upon Diana herself! Nor has your drunken <lb/>
            fury been content with blows, you have even dealt wounds, <lb/>
            such as one receives in battle, and you have defiled the <lb/>
            sacred pavement with human blood! Who ever poured out <lb/>
            such drink offerings to the Ephesian goddess? Barbarians <lb/>

          <p>Attracted by my outcries, a crowd of those who were in <lb/>
            the temple flocked together, who rated him soundly for his <lb/>
            conduct, and the priest himself said, " Are you not ashamed <lb/>
            to exhibit such behaviour openly and in the temple ?" <lb/>
            Encouraged by their presence, " Men of Ephesus!” I said, <lb/>
            is you see how foully I have been treated. Yes ! I, a free <lb/>
            man and a native of no mean city, have had a plot contrived <lb/>
            against my life by this wicked man, and have been preserved <lb/>
            only by the intervention of Diana, who has brought to light <lb/>
            the falsehood of the charge against me. It behoves mo <lb/>
            now to go forth in order to cleanse my face ; I may not do <lb/>
            so within the temple, least the holy water should be defiled <lb/>
            by the blood of violence." Thersander was with difficulty <lb/>
            forced out, and muttered to himself as he departed: " Your <lb/>
            fate is already sealed, and ere long the law shall have its <lb/>
            due ; as for this strumpet who would fain pass for a virgin, <lb/>
            she shall undergo the ordeal of the syrinx. When at last <lb/>
            we were rid of him, I went out and cleansed my face; it <lb/>
            was now supper-time, and the priest entertained us very <lb/>
            hospitably.</p>
          <p>I could not summon up courage to look Sostratus in the <lb/>
            face, from a recollection of what had been my conduct <lb/>
            towards him, and he perceiving this, and guessing my feel­ <lb/>
            ings, was equally unwilling to look towards me; Leucippe <lb/>
            also sat with downcast eyes, so that the supper was alto­ <lb/>
            gether a very solemn affair. When however the wine cir­ <lb/>
            culated, and reserve began to disappear under the influence <figure type="illustration">

              of Bacchus, patron of freedom and ease,* the priest, ad­ <lb/>
              dressing Sostratus, said, “ My worthy guest, will you not <lb/>
              favour us with your own history (-it must, I imagine, con­ <lb/>
              tain some interesting passages, and the listening to such sub­ <lb/>
              jects adds zest to the wine." Sostratus readily availed him­ <lb/>
              self of the opportunity to speak, and replied, " My own <lb/>
              story is a very simple one; you are already acquainted with <lb/>
              my name and country, and when I have added that I am <lb/>
              uncle to this young man and father to the maiden, you have <lb/>
              heard all.”—“ Do you, son Clitopho, (turning to me) lay <lb/>
              aside all bashfulness and relate whatever you have to eay <lb/>
              worth hearing; the grief and vexation which I have en­ <lb/>
              dured is to be attributed to Fortune not to you; besides, <lb/>
              to tell of past troubles when one has escaped from them, is <lb/>
              a source of pleasure rather than of grief.”†</p>
          <p>Upon this, I detailed all the events which had occurred <lb/>
            since leaving Tyre-the voyage, the shipwreck, our being <lb/>
            cast upon the coast of Egypt, our falling among the buc­ <lb/>
            caneers, the carrying off ot Leucippe, the adventures of the <lb/>
            false stomach contrived by Menelaus, the passion conceived <lb/>
            for her by the commander, the discovery of the love potion <lb/>
            by Chæreas, Leucippe's second rape by corsairs, and the <lb/>
            wound received by me of which I exhibited the scar. When <lb/>
            I approached the subject of Melitta, I related the story <lb/>
            in such a manner as to give an exalted idea of my own <lb/>
            continence, yet without being guilty of any falsehood. I <lb/>
            spoke of her violent passion for me, her urgent but unsuc­ <lb/>
            cessful entreaties to obtain its gratification, her munificent <lb/>
            promises, her grief at being disappointed, our subsequent <lb/>
            voyage to Ephesus, the supper, my sharing her bed, and <lb/>
            (invoking at the same time Diana's name) my rising from <lb/>
            her side as pure as one female would from another, my <lb/>
            being seized and put in prison, my false accusation of my­ <lb/>
            self; this and every other matter I detailed down to the <lb/>
            appearance of the Sacred Embassy, suppressing only the <lb/>
            disgrace of my connexion with Melitta.† <note type="footnote"> *" Tu lene tormentum ingenio admoves <lb/>

          <p>" Leucippe's adventures," said I, in continuation, " are <lb/>
            stranger even than mine. She has been sold to slavery, has <lb/>
            been compelled to labour in the field, has been despoiled of <lb/>
            the honours of her bead,. of which you can see the tokens <lb/>
            and then passing on to the conduct of Sosthenes and Ther­ <lb/>
            sander, I entered much more into detail than I had done, <lb/>
            when speaking of myself. My object in doing this, was to <lb/>
            gratify Leucippe, in the hearing of her father. " She has <lb/>
            endured every ill in her person," said I, " excepting one, and <lb/>
            to avoid that one, she has submitted to all the others ; and <lb/>
            has continued, to this day, father (addressing Sostratus), <lb/>
            pure as when first you sent her from Byzantium. It is <lb/>
            no merit in me to have abstained from consummating the <lb/>
            object for which we fled; the merit is entirely on her <lb/>
            side for having preserved inviolate her chastity in the midst <lb/>
            of villains, nay, against that arch villain, the shameless and <lb/>
            violent Thersander. Our flight from home was caused by <lb/>
            mutual love ; but I can assure you, father, that during the <lb/>
            voyage we were quite platonic, our intercourse was no <lb/>
            other than that of a brother and a sister; and if there be <lb/>
            such a thing as virginity in men, I am still a virgin as <lb/>
            regards Leucippe ; she, long since bound herself by a vow to <lb/>
            Diana.†</p>
          <p>" Queen of love," ejaculated I, " be not wroth nor deem <lb/>
            thyself to have been slighted by us! we were but unwilling <lb/>
            to celebrate our nuptials in the absence of the maiden's <lb/>
            father; he has now happily arrived ; be thou present there­ <lb/>
            fore, and smile propitiously upon us." The priest had <lb/>
            listened open-mouthed to my story, and Sostratus had been <lb/>
            shedding tears during the recital of his daughter's suffer­ <note type="footnote"> * of If a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair in <lb/>

            tures," said I to our host," I have a favour to ask of you. <lb/>
            What did Thersander's parting words refer to, when he <lb/>
            made mention of the syrinx ? "—" You have a right to <lb/>
            make the inquiry," replied he; " and I am both able and <lb/>
            willing to comply with your request. It will be some <lb/>
            return for the narrative with which you have just favoured <lb/>
            us. You see the grove in the rear of the temple; in it is <lb/>
            a cave, entrance into which is forbidden to women in <lb/>
            general, but is permitted to maidens who have preserved <lb/>
            their purity. A little within the doors a syrinx is sus­ <lb/>
            pended; perhaps you Byzantians are already acquainted <lb/>
            with the nature of this instrument; should it be otherwise, <lb/>
            I will give you a description of it, and will likewise relate <lb/>
            the legend of Pan, with which it is connected.</p>
          <p>"The syrinx is composed of a certain number of reed <lb/>
            pipes, which collectively produce the same sounds as a <lb/>
            flute; these reeds are placed in regular order and mutually <lb/>
            compacted, presenting the same appearance on either side; <lb/>
            beginning from the shortest, they ascend in gradation to <lb/>
            the longest, and the central one holds a medium proportion <lb/>
            between the two extremities. The principle of this arrange­ <lb/>
            ment arises from the laws of harmony, the two extremes of <lb/>
            sound (as well as of length) are found at either end, and <lb/>
            the intervening pipes convey downwards a gradation of <lb/>
            notes so as to combine the first and shrillest with the last <lb/>
            and deepest of all. The same variety of sounds, (as before <lb/>
            observed) are produced by Minerva's flute* as by the <lb/>
            syrinx of are; but in the former case, the fingers direct the <lb/>
            notes, in the latter, the mouth supplies the place; in the <lb/>
            one case, the performer closes every opening except the <lb/>
            one through which the breath is intended to proceed; in <lb/>
            the other case, he leaves open the aperture of every other <lb/>
            reed, and places his mouth upon that one only which he <lb/>
            wishes to emit a sound ; his lips leap (as we may say) from <lb/>
            reed to reed and dance t along the syrinx; as the laws of <lb/>
            harmony require.‡ Now, this syrinx was originally neither <figure type="illustration">

              pipe nor reed, but a damsel* whose charms made her most <lb/>
              desirable. Smitten by love, Pan pursued her, and she fled <lb/>
              for refuge to a thicket; the god still closely following her, <lb/>
              stretched forth his hand to seize as he supposed her hair, <lb/>
              but lo! instead of hair, he grasped a bunch of reeds, which, <lb/>
              so the legend says, sprang from the earth as she descended <lb/>
              into it. Enraged at his disappointment, Pan cut them <lb/>
              down, imagining that they had stolen from him the object <lb/>
              of his love; but when his search after her still proved <lb/>
              unavailing, he supposed the maiden to have been changed <lb/>
              into these reeds, and wept at his hasty act, thinking that in <lb/>
              so doing he had caused the death of his beloved. He then <lb/>
              proceeded to collect and place together what he imagined to <lb/>
              be her limbs, and holding them in his hands, continued to <lb/>
              kiss what fancy pictured to be the mangled remains of the <lb/>
              maiden's body. Deeply sighing as he imprinted kisses on the <lb/>
              reeds, his sighs found a passage through these hollow <lb/>
              pipes, forming sounds of music, and thus the syrinx came <lb/>
              to have a voice. This instrument Pan suspended within <lb/>
              the cave, and he is said often to resort hither in order to <lb/>
              play upon it. At a period subsequent to the event of <lb/>
              which I am speaking, he conveyed the place as a gift to <lb/>
              Diana, upon the condition that none save a spotless maiden <lb/>
              should be allowed to enter it. Whenever therefore the <lb/>
              virginity of any female comes into suspicion, she is con­ <lb/>
              ducted to the entrance of this cavern, and it is left to the <lb/>
              syrinx to pronounce judgment upon her. She enters in her <lb/>
              usual dress, and immediately the doors are closed. If sibe <lb/>
              proves to be a virgin, a sweetly clear and divinely ravishing <lb/>
              sound is heard, caused either by the air which is there stored <lb/>
              up, finding its way into the syrinx,* or by the lips of the <lb/>
              god himself. After a short space, the doors open of their <lb/>
              own accord, and the maiden makes her appearance, wearing <lb/>
              a crown of pine leaves. If, on the other hand, the female <lb/>
              has falsely asserted her claim to virginity, the syrinx is <lb/>
              silent, and instead of music, the cave sends forth a doleful <note type="footnote"> culties. The translator has endeavoured to give, what (after a com­ <lb/>
              parison of the notes) appeared to him the true sense. </note><note type="footnote"> # See the same legend, towards the end of Longus, B. it. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              sound, upon which those who attended her to the entrance <lb/>
              depart and leave her to her fate. Three days after, the <lb/>
              priestess of the temple enters, and finds the syrinx fallen <lb/>
              to the ground, but the female is no where to be seen. I <lb/>
              have now told you everything, and it is for you maturely to <lb/>
              deliberate upon what course you intend pursuing. If, as I <lb/>
              sincerely hope, the maiden is a virgin, you may fearlessly <lb/>
              submit to the ordeal, for the syrinx has never falsified its <lb/>
              character. Should the case be otherwise, it is needless to <lb/>
              suggest what is the safer course; and you well know, <lb/>
              what a female, exposed as she has been to various perils, <lb/>
              may have been compelled to submit to, quite against her <lb/>
              will."</p>
          <p>Eagerly interrupting the priest, Leucippe said, "You <lb/>
            need be under no alarm on my account, I am quite ready <lb/>
            to enter, and be shut up within the cave."—" I rejoice to <lb/>
            hear you say so," replied he, " and I congratulate you on <lb/>
            the good fortune which has preserved your virtue." As it <lb/>
            was near evening we retired to the chambers prepared for <lb/>
            us by the priest; Clinias had not supped with us from fear <lb/>
            of being burdensome to our kind host, but had returned to <lb/>
            his former lodgings. The legend of the syrinx caused Sos­ <lb/>
            tratus much uneasiness, as he evidently feared, that out of <lb/>
            regard to him, we had been advancing undue claims to <lb/>
            chastity; perceiving this, I made a sign to Leucippe to <lb/>
            remove as best she could, the suspicions of her father. <lb/>
            His anxiety bad not escaped her observation, and even <lb/>
            before receiving a hint from me, she had been devising <lb/>
            how to set his mind at rest. Upon embracing him, there­ <lb/>
            fore, as he retired to rest, "Father," she said, in a low <lb/>
            voice, "you need be under no apprehension; I solemnly <lb/>
            swear to you by Diana, that both of us have spoken nothing <lb/>
            but the truth. The following day, Sostratus and the priest <lb/>
            were occupied in performing the object of the sacred em­ <lb/>
            bassy, by offering the victims; the members of the Senate <lb/>
            were present at the solemnity, and hymns of praise resounded <lb/>
            in honour of the goddess. Thersander also was there, and <lb/>
            coming to the president he desired to have his case post. <lb/>
            poned to the next day, as the condemned criminal had been <lb/>
            set at liberty by some meddling persons, and Sosthenes <lb/>
            could no where be found. His request was complied with, <lb/>
             <pb n="496"/>
            and we on our part, made every preparation for meeting t'he <lb/>
            charge which was to be brought against us. When the <lb/>
            morning of trial arrived, Thersander spoke as follows :—" I <lb/>
            am utterly at a loss how to begin, and against whom first to <lb/>
            direct my charges; the offence which has given rise to this <lb/>
            trial involves various others equal in importance, and impli­ <lb/>
            cates several parties, and each of their offences might supply <lb/>
            matter for a separate trial; my words must almost unavoid­ <lb/>
            ably fail in doing justice to each division of the subject, <lb/>
            and in my eagerness to hasten to some point hitherto <lb/>
            untouched, I must necessarily deal imperfectly with that <lb/>
            upon which I am engaged. How indeed can it be other­ <lb/>
            wise in a case like this, wherein is mixed up adultery, im­ <lb/>
            piety, bloodshed and lawless excesses of every kind! Where <lb/>
            adulterers are found murdering other people's slaves, mur­ <lb/>
            derers corrupting other people's wives, whoremongers and <lb/>
            harlots interrupting and disgracing with their presence <lb/>
            holy solemnities and the most sacred places? Nevertheless <lb/>
            I will proceed. You condemned a criminal to death-on <lb/>
            account of what cause, it matters not—you sent him back <lb/>
            in chains to prison, there to be kept until the execution of <lb/>
            the sentence; yet this man who is virtually your prisoner, <lb/>
            now stands before you at liberty and attired in white; <lb/>
            aye, and no doubt will venture to raise his voice in order <lb/>
            to declaim against me—or rather, I should say, against you <lb/>
            and against the justice of your verdict. I demand to have <lb/>
            the sentence of the Court read aloud.—There, you have <lb/>
            now heard it. ' The sentence of the Court is that Cli­ <lb/>
            topho be put to death.'—Where then is the executioner ? <lb/>
            Let the prisoner be led away, let the hemlock * be admi­ <lb/>
            nistered—he is already dead in law, and has lived a day <lb/>
            too long. And now, what excuse have you to plead, holy <lb/>
            and reverend priest ? In which of the sacred laws do you <lb/>
            find it laid down that prisoners, duly condemned by a sen­ <lb/>
            tence of the court, and delivered up to chains and death, arc <lb/>
            to be rescued and set at liberty. On what grounds do you <lb/>
            arrogate to yourself a power superior to that of the judges <lb/>
            and the Court ? President! it is time for you to quit your <lb/>
            chair and to abdicate to him your place and power! Your <note type="footnote"> * " sorbitio—dira cicutæ"—Persius, S. iv. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="497"/>
            authority is gone, your decrees are good for nought! He <lb/>
            takes upon himself to reverse the sentence you have passed. <lb/>
            -Why any longer stand among us, sir Priest, as a mere <lb/>
            private individual ? By all means go up higher, take your <lb/>
            place upon the bench; issue henceforth your judgments, or <lb/>
            if it please you better, your arbitrary and tyrannical de­ <lb/>
            crees ; spurn law and justice under your feet; believe that <lb/>
            you are more than man; claim for yourself worship next <lb/>
            after Diana, since you have already arrogated her peculiar <lb/>
            privilege. Hitherto she alone has afforded sanctuary to <lb/>
            suppliants, but to suppliants, be it remembered, whom <lb/>
            the law has not yet condemned—not those to whom chains <lb/>
            and death have been decreed, for the altar should be a <lb/>
            refuge not to the wicked but to the unfortunate! You, <lb/>
            forsooth, liberate a prisoner; you acquit a condemned cri­ <lb/>
            minal ! You therefore arrogate a power superior to that of <lb/>
            Diana's self! Who, until now, ever heard of a murderer <lb/>
            and adulterer inhabiting the chamber of a temple, instead <lb/>
            of the dungeon of a prison ? A foul adulterer under the <lb/>
            same roof with a virgin goddess, and having for his partner <lb/>
            a shameless woman, a slave and runaway! You it is who <lb/>
            have entertained the worthy pair at bed and board; nay, <lb/>
            probably have shared her bed. You have converted the <lb/>
            temple of the goddess into a common brothel. You have <lb/>
            made her sanctuary, a den of whoremongers and harlots; <lb/>
            your doings would hardly find a parallel in the vilest stew ! <lb/>
            So far as regards these two I have now done, one will I <lb/>
            trust meet with his just deserts, let the sentence of the law <lb/>
            be put in force against the other.</p>
          <p>" My second charge is against Melitta for adultery; and <lb/>
            here I need not speak at any length, as it has already been <lb/>
            decided that her maids shall be submitted to the torture, in <lb/>
            order to ascertain the truth. I demand, therefore, to have <lb/>
            them produced; and if, after undergoing the question, they <lb/>
            persist in denying their knowledge that the accused has <lb/>
            for a considerable time cohabited with her in my house, not <lb/>
            only in the character of paramour but of husband, then I <lb/>
            am bound freely to acquit her of all blame. But should the <lb/>
            contrary be proved, then I claim that in accordance with <lb/>
            the laws she be deprived of her marriage portion, and that <note type="footnote"> 2 K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="498"/>
            it be given up to me,* in which case the prisoner must <lb/>
            suffer death, the punishment awarded to adulterers. Whe­ <lb/>
            ther, however, he shall suffer under this charge or as a <lb/>
            murderer, matters little; he is guilty of both crimes, and <lb/>
            though suffering punishment will, in fact, be evading <lb/>
            justice,†—for whereas he owes two deaths, he will have paid <lb/>
            but one. One other subject there remains for me to touch <lb/>
            upon: this slave of mine and her respectable pretended <lb/>
            father. I shall, however, reserve what I have to say on this <lb/>
            head until you have come to a decision respecting the other <lb/>
            parties."</p>
          <p>Thersander having now ended, it was for the priest to <lb/>
            speak. He was possessed of eloquence, and had in him a <lb/>
            large share of the Aristophanic vein; accordingly he at­ <lb/>
            tacked Thersander's debauched manner of life with great <lb/>
            wit and humour. " By the goddess," said he, " it is the <lb/>
            sign of having a foul tongue, thus shamelessly to rail <lb/>
            against honest folks,—but it is nothing new to this worthy <lb/>
            gentleman, for throughout his life the filthiness of his <lb/>
            tongue has been notorious.‡ The season of his youth was <lb/>
            passed among the lewdest of mankind, among whom he gave <lb/>
            himself up to the most abandoned practices, and while <lb/>
            affecting gravity, sobriety, and a regard for learning, his <lb/>
            body was made the slave of all impurity. After a time he <lb/>
            left his father's house, and hired a miserable lodging, where <lb/>
            he took up his abode. And how do you suppose he earned <lb/>
            his living ? Why, partly by strolling about the town and <lb/>
            singing ballads, partly by receiving at home fellows like <lb/>
            himself, for purposes which I shall not now name. All this <note type="footnote"> * By the Roman law, a woman convicted of adultery was mulcted <lb/>

              proving his education; whereas, accomplished hypocrite I <lb/>

              his attitudes, and his always choosing to engage in wrestling <lb/>
              with the stoutest and comeliest of the youths, showed his <lb/>
              detestable propensities. Such was his character during <lb/>
              his youthful days. Upon arriving at manhood, he threw <lb/>
              off the mask, and exhibited before the eyes of all the vices <lb/>
              which hitherto he had endeavoured to keep concealed.</p>
          <p>" As he could no longer turn any other part of his body to <lb/>

            and admirably has he succeeded in sharpening it upon the <lb/>
            whetstone of impurity,. making his mouth the vehicle for <lb/>
            shameless speech, pouring out its torrents of abuse on every <lb/>
            one, and having his effrontery stamped upon his very face. <lb/>
            He has gone the length (as you have seen) of coarsely <lb/>
            insulting in your presence an individual whom you have <lb/>
            honoured with the priesthood. Were I a stranger to you, <lb/>
            and had not my life been passed among you, I should deem <lb/>
            it necessary to dwell upon my own character, and that of <lb/>
            my usual associates; but there is no occasion for doing <lb/>
            this. You well know how opposite has been my way of <lb/>
            living to the slanderous imputations which he has cast upon <lb/>
            me. I therefore pass on at once to his recent charges. <lb/>
            I have set at liberty, he says, a convicted criminal; and <lb/>
            upon these grounds he proceeds to inveigh bitterly against <lb/>
            me, and applies to me the epithet of tyrant, and I know <lb/>
            not how many other hard words. Now a tyrant is one who <lb/>
            oppresses the innocent, not one who steps forward to defend <lb/>
            the victim of false accusation. What law, I demand, sanc­ <lb/>
            tioned your committing this young man to prison? Before <lb/>
            what tribunal had he been condemned? What judge had <lb/>
            pronounced his sentence? Granting tho truth of every <lb/>
            charge advanced against him, he has at all events a right to <lb/>
            a fair trial; ho has a right to bo heard in his own defence; <lb/>
            he has a right to be legally convicted! If need be, let <lb/>

              authority over another. But if proceedings such as we <lb/>
              have seen, are to be countenanced, it would be advisable at <lb/>
              once to close the courts, to abolish the tribunals, to depose <lb/>
              the magistrates. With far greater justice may I retort <lb/>
              against him the expressions which he has employed re­ <lb/>
              specting me. I may say, President, make way for Ther­ <lb/>
              sander, for your presidentship is but an empty name,-it is <lb/>
              he who really exercises your powers; nay, more, exercises <lb/>
              powers which you do not possess. You have assessors, <lb/>
              without whose concurrence you can pass no sentence. <lb/>
              You can exercise no authority except upon the judgment <lb/>
              seat; you cannot sit at home and condemn a man to chains <lb/>
              and prisons. This worshipful gentleman, however, is both <lb/>
              judge and jury all offices are, forsooth, concentrated in <lb/>
              his single person ; he makes his house his court of justice; <lb/>
              there he inflicts his punishments; thence he issues his <lb/>
              decrees and condemns a man to chains ; and to make mat­ <lb/>
              ters yet better, he holds his court at night !† And what is it <lb/>
              which now finds employment for his lungs ? ' You have set <lb/>
              free,' he says, 'a criminal condemned to death.' I ask, What <lb/>
              death ? I ask, What criminal ?-for what crime condemned ? <lb/>
              'For murder,' he replies. A murderer! Where, then, <lb/>
              is the murdered victim ? She whom you declared to have <lb/>
              been done to death, stands before you alive and well. The <lb/>
              charge, therefore, at once falls to the ground, for you cannot <lb/>
              consider this maiden as an airy phantom, sent up by Pluto <lb/>
              from the realms below! You are yourself a murderer,­ <lb/>
              aye, and a double murderer. Her you have slain by lying <lb/>
              words ; him you wished in reality to slay. I may add her <lb/>
              also; for we know of your doings in the country. The <lb/>
              great goddess Diana has, however, happily preserved them <lb/>
              both, by delivering the maiden from the hands of Sosthenes, <lb/>
              and this young man from you. As for Sosthenes, you have <lb/>
              purposely got him out of the way, in order to escape detec­ <lb/>

              I have said will have sufficed to clear myself; the defence <lb/>
              of the strangers I shall leave to others."</p>
          <p>An advocate of considerable reputation as an orator, and <lb/>
            a member of the senate,* was about to address the court in <lb/>
            behalf of me and Melitta, when be was interrupted by one <lb/>
            of Thersander's counsel, named Sopater:—" Brother Nicos­ <lb/>
            tralus," said he, "I must claim the right of being first <lb/>
            heard against this adulterous couple; it will be your turn <lb/>
            to reply afterwards.</p>
          <p>" What Thersander said related only to the priest, and <lb/>
            scarcely touched upon the case of the prisoner; and when <lb/>
            I shall prove him to be richly deserving of a two-fold death, <lb/>
            then will be the time for you to rebut my charges." Then, <lb/>
            stroking his chin, and with a great flourish of words, he <lb/>
            proceeded:—"We have listened to the buffoonery of this <lb/>
            priest, venting his scurrilous falsehoods against Thersander, <lb/>
            and endeavouring to turn against him the language so justly <lb/>
            directed against himself. Now, I maintain, that throughout <lb/>
            Thersander has adhered to truth ; the priest has taken upon <lb/>
            himself to liberate a prisoner; he has received a harlot <lb/>
            beneath his roof; be has been on friendly terms with an <lb/>
            adulterer. Not a word has he uttered against Thersander <lb/>
            but what savours of the vilest calumny, but if anything <lb/>
            especially becomes a priest, surely it is to keep a civil <lb/>
            tongue in his head,-and in saying this I am but borrowing <lb/>
            his own words. However, after edifying us with his wit <lb/>
            and jests, he went on to adopt a tragic strain, and bitterly <lb/>
            inveighed against us for handcuffing an adulterer, and send­ <lb/>
            ing him to prison. I wonder what it cost to kindle in him <lb/>
            this prodigious warmth of zeal? Methinks I can give a <lb/>
            tolerably shrewd guess. He has looked with a longing <lb/>
            eye upon the features of these two shameless guests of his , <lb/>
            the wench is handsome, the youth has a goodly countc­ <lb/>
            nance; both are well suited for the private pleasures of a <lb/>
            priest! Which of the two best served your turn ? At any <lb/>
            rate you all slept together ; you all got drunk together; <lb/>
            and there are no witnesses to depose how your nights <lb/>
            were passed. I sadly fear me that Diana's fane has been <lb/>
            perverted into Aphrodite's temple! It will furnish matter <lb/>
            for future discussion whether you are fit to be a priest.</p><pb n="502"/>
            
          <p>As to Thy client Thersander, every one knows that from <lb/>
            his earliest years be has been a pattern of sobriety and <lb/>
            virtue; no sooner was he arrived at manhood, than lie <lb/>
            contracted a marriage according to the laws; his choice <lb/>
            was indeed unfortunate, and trusting to her rank and <lb/>
            wealth, he found himself the husband of a wife very diffe­ <lb/>
            rent from what he had expected. There can be little doubt <lb/>
            that she long ago went astray, unknown to this most exem­ <lb/>
            plary of men; it is plain enough that latterly she has cast <lb/>
            off all shame, and has indulged her disgraceful propensities <lb/>
            to the utmost. No sooner had her husband set out on a <lb/>
            long voyage than she thought it a favourable opportunity <lb/>
            for indulging her loose desires ; and then it was that, un­ <lb/>
            fortunately for her, she lighted upon this ' masculine <lb/>
            whore;'* a paramour who among women is a man, and <lb/>
            among men a woman.</p>
          <p>" Not content to cohabit with him in impunity in a foreign <lb/>
            land, she must needs transport him with her over an extent <lb/>
            of sea, and on the voyage must needs take her lascivious <lb/>
            sport in the sight of all the passengers. 0, shameless <lb/>
            adultery, in which sea and land, had both a share. 0 <lb/>
            shameless adultery, prolonged even from Egypt to Ionia! <lb/>
            Generally, when women are guilty of adultery they confine <lb/>
            themselves to a single act, or if they repeat their crime, it <lb/>
            is with every precaution which may ensure concealment. <lb/>
            In the present case, however, she commits the sin by sound <lb/>
            of trumpet, if I may so say. The adulterer is known to <lb/>
            every one in Ephesus, and she herself is not ashamed to <lb/>
            have brought him hither like so much merchandise ; making <lb/>
            an investment in good looks, taking in a paramour by way <lb/>
            of freight! She will say, ' I concluded my husband to be <lb/>
            dead ?' ' In that case,' I reply, ' were your husband dead, <lb/>
            you would be free from criminality, for there would then be <lb/>
            no sufferer by the adulterous act, nor is any dishonour cast <lb/>

            Thersander here interrupted him, " It is needless to <lb/>
            examine any one by torture, as was formerly proposed. <lb/>
            I offer two challenges: one to this wife of mine, Melitta; <lb/>
            the other to the pretended daughter of this ambassador, <lb/>
            who is lawfully my slave." He then read aloud ; " I <lb/>
            Thersander challenge Melitta and Leucippe (such I un­ <lb/>
            derstand is the strumpet's name) to submit to the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing ordeal:-If the former, as she asserts, has had no <lb/>
            intercourse with this stranger during the period of my <lb/>
            absence, let her go unto the sacred fountain of the Styx, <lb/>
            declare her innocence upon oath, and then stand acquitted <lb/>
            of any further guilt. Let the latter, if free-born and no <lb/>
            longer a maiden, remain my slave, for the temple of the <lb/>
            goddess affords sanctuary to slaves alone; if, on the other <lb/>
            hand, she asserts herself to be a virgin, let her be shut into <lb/>
            the cave of the syrinx." We immediately accepted this <lb/>
            challenge, being already aware that it would be made.</p>
          <p>Melitta, likewise conscious that nothing improper had <lb/>
            taken place during the actual absence of Thersander, said, <lb/>
            " I accept the challenge ; and will here add, that during the <lb/>
            period referred to I had criminal intercourse with no one, <lb/>
            whether foreigner or citizen; and I will ask you," address­ <lb/>
            ing Thersander, "to what penalty will you submit, pro­ <lb/>
            vided the charge prove groundless and calumnious ?"—"" I <lb/>
            will submit to whatever the law decrees, is was his reply. <lb/>
            The court then broke up, the following day being appointed <lb/>
            for the respective ordeals referred to in the challenge. <lb/>
            The following is the legend of the Stygian fountain :­</p>
          <p>" There was once a beauteous maiden, named Rhodopis, <lb/>
            whose supreme delight was in the chase. She was swift of <lb/>
            foot, unerring in her aim; she wore a head-band, had her <lb/>
            robe girt up to the knee, and her hair short, after the fashion <lb/>
            of InCH. Diana, met her, bestowed many commendations <lb/>
            on her, and made her her companion in the chase. The <lb/>
            maiden bound herself by oath to observe perpetual vir­ <lb/>
            ginity, to avoid the company of men, and never to humiliate <lb/>
            herself by submitting to amorous indulgence.* Venus <note type="footnote"> 0 " ....shell not be hit <lb/>
            With Cupid'a arrow, .... <lb/>
            And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'a, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="504"/>
            overheard the oath, and was incensed at it, and determined <lb/>
            to punish the damsel for her presumption. There happened <lb/>
            to be a youth of Ephesus, named Eutbynicus, as much <lb/>
            distinguished among men for beauty as Rhodopis was <lb/>
            among those of her own sex. He was as ardently devoted <lb/>
            to the chase as the maiden, and like her was averse to the <lb/>
            delights of love. One day when Diana was absent, Venus <lb/>
            contrived to make the game which they were following run <lb/>
            in the same direction ; then addressing her archer son, she <lb/>
            said, 'Do you see yon frigid and unloving pair, enemies to <lb/>
            us and to our mysteries ? The maiden has even gone the <lb/>
            length of registering an oath against me! Do you see <lb/>
            them both following a hind ? Join the chase, and begin by <lb/>
            making an example of the maiden ;-your arrows never <lb/>
            miss.' Both at the same moment bend their bows,—she <lb/>
            against the hind, but Cupid against her,-and both hit the <lb/>
            mark, but the successful huntress herself becomes a victim; <lb/>
            her arrow pierces the shoulder of the deer, but Cupid's <lb/>
            shaft penetrates her heart, and the result of the wound was <lb/>
            love for Euthynicus. Cupid then aims a shaft at him, and <lb/>
            with the same effect. For a time they stand and gate <lb/>
            upon each other; their eyes are fascinated; they cannot <lb/>
            turn away;. gradually their inward wounds become in­ <lb/>
            flamed ; the fire kindles,! and love urges their steps to the <lb/>
            cavern where now the fountain flows, and there they violate <lb/>
            their oath.‡ Diana soon after saw Venus laughing, and <lb/>
            readily comprehended what had taken place, and as a <note type="footnote"> From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd <lb/>

            punishment changed the maiden into a fountain, upon the <lb/>
            spot where her chastity was lost. For this reason, when <lb/>
            any female is suspected of impurity, sibe is made to step <lb/>
            into the fountain, which is shallow, reaching only to midleg, <lb/>
            and then it is that the ordeal takes place. The oath decla­ <lb/>
            rative of chastity is written on a tablet, and suspended from <lb/>
            her neck; if truly sworn, the fountain remains unmoved; <lb/>
            if falsely taken, it swells and rages, rises to her neck, and <lb/>
            flows over the tablet."</p>
          <p>Next morning a great concourse assembled, and at the <lb/>
            head came Thersander, with a confident expression of coun­ <lb/>
            tenance, and looking at us with a contemptuous smile. <lb/>
            Leucippe was attired in a sacred robe of fine white linen, <lb/>
            reaching to the feet and girded about her waist; round <lb/>
            her head she had a purple fillet, and her feet were bare. <lb/>
            She entered the cavern with an air of becoming modesty. <lb/>
            Upon seeing her disappear within, I was overcome by <lb/>
            agitation, and said mentally, " I doubt not your chastity, <lb/>
            dearest Leucippe, but I am afraid of Pan; he is a virgin- <lb/>
            loving god, and for aught I know, you may become a second <lb/>
            syrinx. His former mistress easily escaped him, for her <lb/>
            course lay over an open plain; whereas you are shut up <lb/>
            within doors, and so blockaded that flight is out of the <lb/>
            question, however much you may wish to fly. 0 Pan! be <lb/>
            thou propitious; do not violate the statutes of the place, <lb/>
            which we have religiously observed; grant that Leucippe <lb/>
            may again return to us a virgin; remember thy compact <lb/>
            with Diana, and do no injury to the maiden." While <lb/>
            talking to myself in this manner, sounds of music proceeded <lb/>
            from the cavern, more ravishingly sweet, I was assured, <lb/>
            than had been heard on any former occasion: the doors <lb/>
            were immediately opened, and when Leucippe sprang forth, <lb/>
            the multitude shouted with delight, and vented execrations <lb/>
            upon Thersander. What my own feelings were, I cannot <lb/>
            pretend to describe. After gaining this first signal triumph, <lb/>
            we left the spot, and proceeded to the place which was to be <lb/>
            the scene of the remaining ordeal, the people following <lb/>
            again to behold the spectacle. Everything was in readiness, <lb/>
            the tablet was suspended to Melitta's neck, and she de­ <lb/>
            scended into the shallow fountain with a smiling counte­ <lb/>
            nance. No change was perceptible in the water, which <lb/>
             <pb n="506"/>
            remained perfectly still, and did not in the slightest degree <lb/>
            exceed its usual depth, and at the expiration of the allotted <lb/>
            time the president came forward, and taking Melitta by <lb/>
            the hand, conducted her out of the fountain. Thersander, <lb/>
            already twice defeated, and surely anticipating a third <lb/>
            defeat, took to his heels and fled to his own house, fearing <lb/>
            that the people would, in their fury, stone him. His <lb/>
            apprehensions were well founded, for some young men <lb/>
            were seen at a distance dragging Sosthenes along; two of <lb/>
            them were Melitta's kinsmen, and the others were servants, <lb/>
            whom she had despatched in quest of him. Thersander <lb/>
            had caught sight of him, and feeling sure that when put to <lb/>
            the torture he would confess everything, he secretly left <lb/>
            the city, as soon as night came on. Sosthenes was com­ <lb/>
            mitted to prison by order of the magistrates, and we returned <lb/>
            triumphant upon every point, and accompanied by the shouts <lb/>
            and good wishes of the people.</p>
          <p>Next morning they whose business it was. conducted <lb/>
            Sosthenes before the magistrates. Aware that he was <lb/>
            about to be put to the question, he made a full confes­ <lb/>
            sion of everything, stating how far Thersander had been <lb/>
            the prime agent, and how far he had himself assisted in <lb/>
            carrying out his schemes! nor did he omit to repeat the <lb/>
            conversation which had taken place between his master and <lb/>
            him before the cottage-door. He was sent back to prison <lb/>
            there to await his sentence, and a decree of banishment <lb/>
            was pronounced against Thersander. When this business <lb/>
            was concluded, we again returned to the hospitable dwell­ <lb/>
            ing of the priest, and while at supper resumed the subject <lb/>
            of our former conversation, mutually relating any incidents <lb/>
            which had previously been omitted. Leucippe, now that <lb/>
            the purity of her character was fully established, no longer <lb/>
            stood in awe of her father, but took pleasure in narrating <lb/>
            the events which had befallen her. When she came to that <lb/>
            part of her story which referred to Pharos and the pirates, <lb/>
            I requested her to give us every particular about them, <lb/>
            and especially to explain the riddle of the severed head, as <lb/>
            this alone was wanting to complete the history of her <lb/>
            adventures. " The recital will interest us all," I said, <lb/>
            “ especially your father." <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_33_fig138.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="507"/>
              “The unhappy female to whom you allude,” replied <lb/>
              Leucippe, "was one of that class who sell their charms <lb/>
              for money. She was inveigled on board, under pretence of <lb/>
              becoming the wife of a sea captain, and remained there in <lb/>
              ignorance of the real cause for which she had been brought, <lb/>
              passing her time in the company of one of the pirates, who <lb/>
              pretended to have a passion for her. When I was seized, <lb/>
              they placed me, as you saw, in a boat, and rowed off with all <lb/>
              their might; and afterwards when they perceived that tho <lb/>
              vessel despatched in pursuit was gaining upon them, they <lb/>
              stripped the wretched woman of her clothes, which they <lb/>
              put on me, making her dress herself in mine; then placing <lb/>
              her at the stern in sight of the pursuers, they cut off her <lb/>
              head and cast the body overboard, doing the same with the <lb/>
              head, when the pursuit was given up. Whether she bad <lb/>
              been brought on board for the above purpose, or in order <lb/>
              to be sold, as they afterwards told me, I cannot say; <lb/>
              certain it is that she was put to death by way of eluding <lb/>
              the pursuers, the pirates imagining that I should fetch <lb/>
              more money as a slave than she would do. It was this <lb/>
              determination on their part which earned his just reward <lb/>
              for Chæreas, who had suggested the murder of the female <lb/>
              in place of me. The pirates refused to let him retain ex­ <lb/>
              clusivo possession of me, saying that on his account one <lb/>
              woman had already been lost to them, who would have been <lb/>
              a source of gain. They proposed, therefore, that I should <lb/>
              be sold to make up the loss, and that the money should be <lb/>
              equally divided. He replied in an angry and threatening <lb/>
              manner, asserting his prior claims, and reminding them of <lb/>
              their compact, and that I had been carried off, not in order <lb/>
              to be sold, but to be his mistress. Upon this, one of the <lb/>
              pirates came behind him, and dealt him his measure of <lb/>
              justice by striking off his head and flinging his body into <lb/>
              the sea,—a worthy requital of his perfidious conduct to­ <lb/>
              wards me.</p>
          <p>" After two days' sail, the pirates put in at some place, the <lb/>
            name of which I do not know, where they sold me to a <lb/>
            . merchant who used to traffic with them, and from his hands <lb/>
            I passed into the possession of Sosthenes."</p>
          <p>“ My children," said Sostratus, when Leucippe had <lb/>
            concluded, “ I will now relate what has happened to Calli­ <lb/>
             <pb n="508"/>
            gone, for it is but fair that I should contribute my share <lb/>
            to the conversation.” * Upon hearing my sister's name <lb/>
            mentioned, I became all attention, and said, “Prithee, sir, <lb/>
            proceed; I shall rejoice to hear that she is still alive." <lb/>
            He commenced by repeating what has already been men­ <lb/>
            tioned respecting Callisthenes, the oracle given to the <lb/>
            Byzantians, the sacred embassy sent to Tyre, and the <lb/>
            stratagem for carrying off Calligone. He went on to say : <lb/>
            " Callisthenes discovered during the voyage that she was <lb/>
            not my daughter; but although matters had thus turned <lb/>
            out quite contrary to his intentions, he conceived a strong <lb/>
            passion for his fair captive, and throwing himself at her <lb/>
            knees: ‘ Lady,' he said, ‘ do not imagine that I am a corsair <lb/>
            or a villain; I am of good birth, and second in rank to <lb/>
            none in Byzantium. It is Love who has compelled me to <lb/>
            turn pirate, and to employ this stratagem against you. <lb/>
            Deign, therefore, to consider me your slave from this day <lb/>
            forth. I offer you my hand in marriage. You shall have for <lb/>
            your dowry more wealth than your father would have <lb/>
            bestowed upon you, and you shall preserve your maiden <lb/>
            state so long as you may please.'</p>
          <p>" By means of these, and other insinuating words, he <lb/>
            brought her to look favourably upon him, for he was hand­ <lb/>
            some in person and possessed a flow of persuasive language. <lb/>
            Upon arriving at Byzantium he had a deed drawn up assign­ <lb/>
            ing her an ample dowry ; he then proceeded to make other <lb/>
            preparations, purchased for her splendid dresses, jewellery <lb/>
            and ornaments, in short, whatsoever was required for the <lb/>
            wardrobe and toilette of a lady of rank and wealth. Having <lb/>
            done this, he abstained from soliciting her virtue, and in rule <lb/>
            filment of his promise allowed her to remain a maiden, and <lb/>
            thus he gradually won her affections. In a short time, <lb/>
            quite a wonderful alteration took place in the young man ; <lb/>
            he became conciliatory in manner, and prudent and orderly <lb/>
            in his mode of living; he shewed respect by rising up before <lb/>
            his elders,t and was the first courteously to salute any <lb/>
            whom he met; his former indiscriminate profusion, which <figure type="illustration">

              had been mere lavish prodigality, now became wisely di­ <lb/>

              suffering from poverty and required assistance.</p>
          <p>" All who remembered his former and dissolute course of <lb/>
            life were amazed at this sudden change. He shewed me the <lb/>
            most marked attention, and I could not help loving him <lb/>
            and attributing his former conduct more to an excess of <lb/>
            open-heartedness than to any actual vicious propensities, <lb/>
            and I called to mind the case of Themistocles, who after a <lb/>
            youth spent in licentiousness, in after life excelled all his <lb/>
            countrymen in soundness of judgment and many virtues.* <lb/>
            I really felt sorry at having repulsed him, when he was a <lb/>
            suitor for my daughter's hand, he treated me with so much <lb/>
            respect, giving me the title of father, and escorting me t <lb/>
            whenever I had occasion to go through the forum. He <lb/>
            likewise took great interest in military exercises, especially <lb/>
            in what related to the cavalry department; he had always <lb/>
            been fond of horses, but hitherto merely to indulge his love <lb/>
            of amusement and his luxurious tastes; yet though ac­ <lb/>
            tuated by no higher motives, he had been unconsciously <lb/>
            fostering the seeds of skill and courage; and eventually his <lb/>
            chii ambition was to distinguish himself by valour and <lb/>
            ability in the field. He contributed largely from his own <lb/>
            private resources the expenses of the war, and was elected <lb/>
            my colleague in command, in which position he shewed me <lb/>
            a still greater degree of attention and deference. When at <lb/>
            length, victory declared itself on our side, through the <lb/>
            visible intervention of the deity,‡ we returned to Byzan­ <lb/>
            tium, and it was decreed, that the public thanks of the <lb/>
            State should be conveyed to Hercules and Diana, for which <lb/>
            purpose he was to proceed to Tyre, while I was despatched <lb/>
            to this city. Before setting out Callisthenes took me by <lb/>

            have pursued, deliberate choice and principle have in­ <lb/>
            fluenced my actions. I have scrupulously respected the <lb/>
            maiden's honour, during a time of war and confusion when <lb/>
            men are generally least inclined to deny themselves the <lb/>
            indulgence of their desires. My intention is now to con­ <lb/>
            duct her to her fathers house, at Tyre; and then to claim <lb/>
            her for my bride, at her father's hand, in accordance with <lb/>
            the law.* I have made an ample settlement upon her, and <lb/>
            shall consider myself most fortunate, if he grants my <lb/>
            suit; if, on the contrary, I meet with a repulse he will <lb/>
            receive back his daughter as pure as when she left his <lb/>
            home..</p>
          <p>“ I will now read you a friendly letter, which—feeling <lb/>
            anxious that the marriage should be concluded—I addressed <lb/>
            to my brother, before the termination of the war, in which <lb/>
            I mentioned the rank of Callisthenes, and bore testimony <lb/>
            to his good birth, the honourable position which he had <lb/>
            attained, and his eminent services in the field. If we gain <lb/>
            our cause in the new trial t moved by Thersander, I pro­ <lb/>
            pose, first of all to sail to Byzantium, and afterwards to <lb/>
            proceed to Tyre.</p>
          <p>Clinias came to us next day, with the intelligence that <lb/>
            Thersander had secretly left the city, that his object in <lb/>
            appealing from the recent decision was but a pretext to <lb/>
            gain time, and that lie had no intention of following up the <lb/>
            case. After waiting three days, the period appointed for <lb/>
            taking fresh proccedings,‡ we appeared before the Pre­ <lb/>
            sident, and having satisfactorily proved by reference to the <lb/>
            statutes, that Thersander had no longer any legal ground <lb/>
            against us, we embarked and enjoyed a favourable voyage <lb/>
            to Byzantium, where our long-desired nuptials took place. <lb/>
            A short time after, we sailed to Tyre, which we reached <note type="footnote"> * The law referred to in B. iL </note> <figure type="illustration">

              two days after the arrival of Callisthenes, and where I <lb/>
              found my father preparing to celebrate my sisteres wedding <lb/>
              on the following day. We were present on the occasion, <lb/>
              and assisted at the religious ceremonial, offering up our <lb/>
              united prayers that both our marriages might be crowned <lb/>
              with happiness; and we arranged, after wintering at Ephe. <lb/>
              sus, to proceed to Byzantium in the spring.</p>
