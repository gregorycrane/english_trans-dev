<title type="main">TO THE READER.</title>
</head>
<p>IN this third edition, the translation of Aristotle'is Rhetoric has been again carefully compared with the Greek, and revised and corrected throughout. Numerous explanatory and illustrative notes have also been added; as well as a marginal analysis, which it is presumed will be found of much service to the reader.</p>
<p>The famous Thomas Hobbes' Brief of the Art of Rhetorick, "containing in substance all that Aristotle hath written in his three books on that subject," and forming the best summary of this noble science, has been again reprinted from the scarce edition published at London in 1681. A body of Analytical Questions, for self-examination, has also been appended.</p>
<p>With these improvements, the Editor confidently hopes that the present volume will be found to contain, not only the most faithful version of the Rhetoric of Aristotle, but the best helps for the due understanding and retaining the sense thereo.

<note type="footnote">Oxford, November, 1846. </note> </p>
<p>IN the present new edition of the Oxford version of. the Rhetoric, it has been thought advisable not to interfere either with the text, notes, or Questions, all being of acknowledged excellence. But, as Hobbes, by the
<pb n="iv"/>
quaintness of his Analysis, at times lost sight of the precise character of the original definitions, an Appendix has been added, containing the very words of Aristotle, connected by such remarks as were necessary to preserve clearness, and furnishing such passages as should be almost learnt by heart.</p>
<p>The new translation of the Poetic is an attempt to unite the closeness of Taylor with the perspicuity of Twining, upon whose versions it has principally been based. A copious selection from the notes of the last named scholar has been added, together with a few necessary ones from recent sources by the present Editor,</p>

It is further evident that the

<note type="margin"> 3rd. </note> to assign what is just and expedient: and, what is most of all to the point, is this, that the award of the legislator is not particular nor about present circumstances, but about what is future and general; whereas the member of a popular assembly and the judge decide on points actually present and definite ; and under their circumstances, feelings of partiality, and dislike, and personal expediency, will, in many instances, antecedently have been interwoven with the case ; and to such a degree, that one is no longer able, adequately, to contemplate the truth, and that personal pleasure or pain throws a shade over the

<note type="footnote" n="10">As the young man can learn consequences (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃτι</foreign>)* ere he discovers principles, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διότι</foreign>, Eth. lib. i.,) so can most men better judge of individual cases by <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστικὴ φρόνησις</foreign>, than frame laws by <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομοθετικὴ φρόνησις</foreign>. (Eth. lib. vi.) And this is proved by the universal bias of orators to individual cases founded on law. To borrow an illustration from the arts, we may say, that as a person placed in the centre of a landscape has a fuller view of any individual object in it than the painter himself, but loses proportionately the general effect; so the judge can discern all the particulars of a given case, but cannot, as the legislator who contemplates at a distance, view so well the general bearings and effects of any law when united or contrasted with others. Cf. also the Ethics, lib. v. c. 1.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸρθω̄ς μὲν νόμος ὁ κείμενος ὀρθω̃ς' χει̃ρον δὲ</foreign> O <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπεσχεδιασμένος</foreign>. </note>

</note>observed, it is right to leave the judge a discretion in
as few as possible11: but questions of fact, whether it has or has not taken place, will or will not happen, does or does not exist; all such it is necessary12 to abandon to the discretion of the judges ; since it is not possible that the legislator ever should foresee them.</p>
<p>If these things be so, it is plain that they embrace

<note type="chapter"> 9. </note> in their systems matters foreign to the subject, who give us explanations of the other points, as for instance-what the proem, and the narration, and the other divisions, ought severally to embrace: for in these treatises they busy themselves about nothing else, except how to render the judge of a certain disposition ; while on the subject of those means of persuasion, recognised by art, they discover nothing ; and yet this is the source whence an orator may become a good reasoner. And it is for this reason

<note type="margin"> 10. Reasons why men prefer judicial to deliberative oratory. </note> that, notwithstanding the same system is conversant about deliberative and judicial cases, and although the business of the senate is more honourable, and embraces higher social interests, than that whose subject is merely the transactions of individuals; yet about the former they say not one word, while all undertake to frame systems of judicial pleading. And13 they are not without a reason for this, since

<note type="footnote" n="11">Cf. Hooker, v. § 9, p. 36. </note>

<note type="footnote" n="12">It is not in the nature of things that any human legislator should determine on the infinite number of possible cases; or that he should not, with regard to some, be an unsafe guide to our decisions : for the last of these inconveniences we have a remedy in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲπιείκεια</foreign>; since equity is, as he subsequently describes it, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ του̃ ἰδίου νόμου καὶ γεγραμμένου ἒλλειμμα</foreign>, and

<note type="footnote" n="13">This error is a consequence on the one mentioned before, § 3: from the disregard there noticed of the enthymem and
<foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστις</foreign>, orators are naturally led to attach themselves to that
branch of public speaking which requires enthymem least; and such is judicial pleading, inasmuch as the cause there rests mainly on evidence, properly so called, on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτέχναι πίστεις</foreign>. Aristotle himself gives as another reason for this preference, the greater ease of judicial oratory. (Vide lib. iii. c. xvii. § 10.) </note>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK I. </note>
in deliberative speeches it is less worth while to state matters foreign to the subject, and a deliberative speech admits less of malicious sophistry than judicial pleading, but is more widely interesting; for here the judge [i. e. the senator] decides on questions which nearly interest himself, so that no more is necessary than to prove that the question stands just as he, the adviser, asserts. In judicial questions, however, this is not sufficient, but it is worth while to engage the hearer; for the decision is about a case which does not affect himself: so that the judges, looking to their own gratification, and listening with a view to amusement, surrender themselves up to the pleaders ; and, strictly speaking, do not fulfil the character of judges14. On which very account the law, in many places, as I before remarked, forbids

<note type="footnote"> And this he proves, first, because that which has been is plain to all, even to diviners; secondly, the orator having law for a premiss, the demonstration is easier. To these reasons may be added one which the master of Alexander would not willingly have allowed, namely, the loss of liberty to Greece, and the consequent loss of all interest in deliberative questions, to men whose future fates were totally out of their own power. </note>

<note type="footnote" n="14">A writer in the Quarterly Review, No. 26, after contrasting the perplexity of English law with the simplicity of Athenian jurisprudence, says, " This simplicity in the law made it the orator's business less to hunt for cases and precedents than to discriminate character; less to search for errors in a bill than for flaws or errors in a witness's life or testimony. And the prevalence of this practice may be inferred from a subsequent passage in this book, (c. ix. § 38,) where Isocrates is mentioned as an adept in the comparison of characters, " which," says Aristotle, " he used to do to further his familiarity with judicial pleading." To this we may subjoin the following remarks of Mitford on a speech by Alcibiades: “ The multitude ordinarily composing an Athenian court of justice was so great, that the pleaders always addressed it as under the impulse of the same interests, and subject to the same feelings as the general assembly, and equally without responsibility. Impartiality was never supposed; the passions were always applied to; and it never failed to be contended between the parties, which could most persuade the jurors that their interest was implicated with his, and that by deciding in his favour they would be gainers." Hist. of Greece, vol. v. p. 94. So also Xenophon, in his Athenian Republic, c. i. § 13.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒν τε τοῑς δικαστηρίοις οὐ τοῡ δικαίου</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

Reasons why the logician will probably be the beet rhetorician. </note> about the means of making credible, and as this is a sort of proof, <stage>(because we are then most persuaded when we conceive that the point has been proved,)</stage> but the proof of rhetoric is enthymem, <stage>(and this, to speak generally, has the most sovereign effect of all the means of persuasion ;)</stage> and the enthymem is a sort of syllogism ; since too it is the province of logic to consider equally every sort of syllogism, whether of that art as a whole, or of some particular branch of it; then, these points being admitted, it is evident that the man best able to consider the question, out of what sources and how the syllogism arises, will moreover be in the highest degree capable of employing enthymems ; provided he make himself acquainted, besides his logic, with the kind of subjects about which enthymems are conversant, and what differences they exhibit as compared with the syllogism of logic. Because it belongs to the same faculty of the mind to recognise both truth and the semblance, of truth ; and more thanthis, mankind have a15 tolerable natural tendency toward that which is true; and, in general, bit the truth; wherefore an aptness in conjecturing probabilities belongs to birD who hasa similar aptness in regard to truth. It is plain, then, that other rhetoricians embrace in their systems, points foreign to the subject, and what reasons they have for inclining to the subject of judicial pleading in preference to the other branches of rhetoric.</p>

thermore, in the case of some people, not even if we had the most accurate scientific knowledge, would it be easy to persuade them were we to address them through the medium of that knowledge; for a scientific discourse, it is the privilege of education [to appreciate], and it is impossible that this [should extend to the multitude16] ; bat we must construct our means of persuasion, and our addresses, through the medium of ordinary language; as in fact I stated in my Topics, "on the manner of communicating with

<note type="footnote" n="23">In order more fully to illustrate the nature of rhetoric, Aristotle has considered it throughout thischapteras analogous to logic. Each, he says, is founded on a faculty naturally possessed by all men; each is useful, and applicable with equal propriety to any class of subjects whatever. Besides this, logic and rhetoric alone, of all arts, are equally conversant with opposite inferences; and of course with sound and specious arguments (whether in the form of syllogism or enthymem). Now as logic and rhetoric are in their own nature indifferent to truth or falsehood, it must require an act of choice in either case to select the former or the latter, and the constant repetition of that choice will ultimately form a corresponding habit. Hence the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλεκτικὸς</foreign> may be considered as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνάμει σοφιστὴς</foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφιστὴς</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνάμει διαλεκτὸς</foreign>. But when logic is prostituted to the support of false propositions, by the bad principles (the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρσαὶρεσις</foreign>) of its professors, it is branded with the name of sophistry, and the persons who so misapply it are called sophists: whereas, in the case of rhetoric, no such distinction in reference to the principles of its professors ever obtained ; but the name of orator is enjoyed equally by all who aremasters of the art, whether they exercise it fairly or not, </note><figure type="illustration">

Whence rhetoric is invested with the costume<ref n="4"/> of that science, as well as its professors, partly from inexperience, partly arrogance, and in part from other human causes ; because, as I stated at the outset, it is a sort of subordinate division of logic, and portraiture of it; neither of them being a science of any one definite

Now Aristotle, so far from holding a person guilty of presumption for such an use of the term, would rather retort on the accuser the charge of ignorance of its true import. For with a view to invest their art, and of consequence themselves, with an air of dignity, the professors of rhetoric, said he, would have the world think (some of them, poor creatures, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαιδευσιαν</foreign>) that it was applicable exclusively to such cases as are of high concernment to society. This in part is true; rhetoric is <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραφυὲς τη̃ς Πολιτει̃ας</foreign> : but, as Majoragius observes, " Virgulta magnam quidem cum arboribus quibus adnascuntur habent similitudinem, et rerum naturam redolent.

For if any of these<ref n="4"/> be known, it is not necessary to mention it; for the hearer of himself makes this addition. For example, in order to convey the information that Dorieus was conqueror in a contest where a chaplet is the prize; it suffices to say, that he conquered in the Olympic games : but as to the circumstance that, having conquered at Olympia, he got a chaplet, there is no necessity for adding it, because every one knows it.</p>

<note type="footnote">Another explanation, founded on three passages, the first in
the Analytics; the second by Cicero (de Inv. i. 30); the third in Quintilian, (v. c. ix. 10,) adopted by Majoragius, is as follows : The <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign> is some sensible fact, either attested by sense or reducible thereto, not a general truth; hence it will be the minor premiss in the enthymem, not the major, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημειόμενον</foreign> or thing signified by it, being the conclusion, and as the latter is known solely through and by the former, there is always a real or supposed connexion between them. </note>

The latter then, as regards the former, will stand in the ratio of a whole to its part; as individual or particular nature to common or generic: what is definite always containing or implying more than what is indefinite (on which principle we are told in logic that the species is more of a whole than a genus). Hence it is defined,
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς τῶν καθεκαστόν τι πρὸς τὸ αθόλου</foreign>, and is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂναγκαῖον</foreign>
or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκμήριον</foreign>. Hence Quintilian, observing the conclusiveness of this argument, denies it the name of argument at all: " Non sunt argumenta, quia ubi illa sunt, queestio non est;" an error resembling that made by certain modem philosophers, who deny the utility of logic because the premises of a syllogism virtually imply the conclusion. </note>

pears in the same mood as the first, scilicet, Barbara, but in the second figure, hence an illicit process of the minor term.

<note type="footnote"> relation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign> and the conclusion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκεῖνο πρὸς</foreign> o <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign>) is the strict logical relation of universal to particular, or of a generic law to its application in an individual instance. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign> therefore is the major premiss, not the minor. </note>

<note type="footnote"> We see that the universal major in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign> enthymem cannot be the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign> itself, because it is detached from any particular relation, and involves no particular deduction : nor yet is this major, though universal, an <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign>, being <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁπλῶς</foreign> and totally true, which is inconsistent with the very meaning of the word " probable." </note>

<note type="footnote"> Again, though the minor premiss of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὀς</foreign> enthymem contains a simple matter of fact, it is not a <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖν</foreign>, for to constitute a sign it must point to something else equally necessary with itself; a condition not fulfilled by the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign> enthymem conclusion. Still there is so much affinity between the minor premiss of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign> enthymem, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνὡνυμον σημεῖον</foreign>, that by converting the major premiss, with the addition of the word " probably" to the copula, we shall change the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign> into an <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign> of low degree: e. g. All who have a fever breathe hard. This man breathes hard. This man has a fever. Those who breathe hard probably have a fever. This man breathes hard. This man probably has a fever. And this affinity perhaps led Quintilian to confound Aristotle'a
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνώνυμου σημεῖον</foreign> with his <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign>. (lib. v. c. ix. § 8.) It is this
kind of " sign" and the argument deducible from it, which constitutes what, in criminal cases, is called circumstantial evidence. </note>

<note type="footnote"> Aristotle mentions another sort of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign> (§ 18) which comes out a syllogism in the third figure, with an universal conclusion, and hence its error is an illicit process of the minor term. The principle on which this syllogism proceeds is an imperfect, precarious induction, and endeavours to deduce a general truth from a particular instance. The ratio, therefore, of the sign to the thing signified, is as one to all. This, it will be observed, is a new signification of the terms <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθόλου</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθ᾽ ἒκαστον</foreign>, but one which they will obviously admit, and borne out by the example he adduces. </note>

<note type="footnote" n="11">The usual definition of e<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰκὀ</foreign>s is considered by Aristotle as too vague; he limits it, therefore, to contingent matter, and would have it stand in such a relation to the conclusion to be drawn, as an universal to a particular.

no name assigned to it in reference to its difference

<note type="margin">17. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκ­ μήριον</foreign>. </note> [as a species.] Now by necessary propositions, I mean those out of which a syllogism is adduced ; and hence this kind of signs is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκμήριον</foreign>, for when they think it impossible to do away what has been stated, people then esteem that they adduce a <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκμή­ ριον</foreign> ; the point having been evinced and concluded; for, according to the old language, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέκμαρ</foreign> is the

Again, there is one sign whose ratio is as that of a particular to an universal: thus, were one to assert, for instance, that wise are just;,-because Socrates wise and just this then is a sign, but it may be done away, even supposing the premiss stated to be true ; for it violates the rules of syllogism, as to the other, when, for instance, a person alleges as a sign that a man is sick, his being in a fever ; or says a woman has had a child, because she has milkl ; this is a necessary sign ; which very one of the signs alone amounts to a <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκμήριον</foreign> ; since it alone, if the premiss be true, cannot be done away. The other sign is in the ratio of an universal to a particular ; as if, for instance,

<note type="footnote"> Corinthians at Athens state as an <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign>, that the Corcyraeans were addicted to piracy, their shunning alliances with other states, because those who would become pirates study secrecy; but this broad fact is, when compared with the single case of the Corcyraeans, as an universal to a particular, or as a whole to a part, pirates being one class only of the many who study secrecy as a veil to crime.

For instance, you assert that Dionysius, in asking a guard, has views of setting up a tyranny, because Pisistratus before him, when designing this, began to ask for a body guard, and when he got it, established himself as tyrant; so too did Theogenes, at Megara. And all other persons who have acted in this way, and with whom your audience are acquainted, become examples against Dionysius, with respect to whom they do not yet know whether he be asking a guard with this intention : and all these

Two different sorts of enthymemo </note> The difference of enthymems is considerable, and has remarkably escapednearly every writer : it is, too, a difference the very same as exists between syllogisms in logic : for some enthymems there are of applicability equal to that of rhetoric itself, in the same way that in some syllogisms are; others, according to the extent of other arts and faculties, existing, some already, and others not yet comprised by rules. And hence those who employ them both escape the observation of their hearers, and if they handle them more than is right, pass out of their pro-

I call those forms of reasoning16 properly logical or rhetorical, in reference to which, I use the expression places ; such are those which apply with equal advantage to questions of justice, and natural philosophy, and of the philosophy of social life, and to numerous other subjects which differ in species. The place for instance, of greater and less; for there will not be a whit more advantage in deducing a syllogism or an enthymem from this place, on a question of justice or of natural philosophy, than on any other subject whatsoever;

<note type="margin"> 2nd. <foreign xml:lang="grc">είδη</foreign>. </note> and yet there are questions specifically distinct. But I call peculiar, all those reasonings which arise out of propositions, conversant with each species and genus of subjects; for instance, there are propositions on subjects of natural philosophy17 out of which neither

<note type="footnote" n="15">By the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ αὐτὸ γένος</foreign> is understood a common circumstance and property of nature ; by the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign> OO'TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθόλου</foreign>, the general proposition in reference to all such cases. </note>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. II.] </note>
enthymem nor syllogism could be constructed respecting morals; and on this subject, again, there are others out of which will arise no reasoning respecting natural philosophy; this is also the case equally on every subject. Now the first-mentioned reasonings <stage>(the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόποι</foreign>)</stage> will render a man informed on no class of subjects, for they are about no distinct subject-matter: as to the other <stage>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴδια</foreign>)</stage>, the orator, in proportion as he makes the better 18 selection of propositions peculiar, will imperceptibly produce a science different from mere rhetoric or logic19 ; for, if he light on first principles, thenceforth, it will no longer be rhetoric or logic which he is employing, but that science whose principles he embraces.</p>

Thus, then, there will necessarily result three kinds of orations, the deliberative, judicial, and demonstrative2. The business of deliberation is partly exhortation, partly. dissuasion ; for invariably those who in their individual capacities simply advise, and those who publicly harangue, effect one of these objects. The business of judicial rhetoric is partly accusation, partly defence; for the litigants must of course do one or the other of these things. Of demonstrative the business

time proper to each of these respectively is, to the deliberative orator, the future; for in exhorting or dissuading, he advises respecting thingsfuture3. The time proper to a judicial pleader is thepast;for it is ever on the subject of actions already that tEe one party accuses, and the other defends. To the demonstrative orator the present time is the most appropriate, for it is in reference to qualities actually possessed that all eithr praise or blame.Orators, however, do very frequently avail themselves of other times; as well by awakening a recollection of what has already happened, as by anticipating what is likely to happen. The end of each of these

<note type="margin"> 5. and end peculiar to each. </note> branches is different, and, as belonging to three subjects, is itself triple.*</p>
<p>The object of the deliberative orator is the expe-* dient and inexpedient; for he who recommends, advises you to adopt the better measure; but he who dissuades, diverts you from the worse; the other considerations either of justice and injustice, of honour or disgrace, he adjoins by the way, in addition to these two. The object of the judicial pleader is justice and injustice; but he also embraces by the way those oTher considerations. The object of those praise andblame is honour and disgrace ; and these also refer other considerations to tHese two.</p>
<p>But we may take as a sign that what I have stated

<note type="margin"> 6. Proof of this from fact. </note> is the particular object of each, the fact that there are times when they will not feel inclined even to raise a question about the other: the litigant, for example, will not always deny that the fact has taken place, or that it has hurt the other party; but he

<note type="footnote" n="3"> " Passion may be as much excited by the orator's reasonings on a future event, as on one past; and indeed the future, caeteris paribus, produces the greater effect on us, as that to which we are approaching, and what every moment gives us the added interest in, which it takes from the past. But then the past has the counterbalancing privilege of being susceptible of infinitely better testimony and evidence, from memory, present effects, etc.; memory, indeed, the great eye of the mind, unlike that of the body, sees all we have left behind, and nothing before it."

never, under any circumstances, would admit that he has been guilty of injustice toward him ; for then would there be no need of a judicial decision. In the same way the deliberative orator very often abandons the other considerations ; but as to the point that he is advising what is disadvantageous, or dissuading from what is useful, this will he never admit; but it frequently happens that <stage>(on a question of invasion)</stage> they do not trouble themselves to make out that the subjugating a neighbouring people is not inconsistent with justice. Just so those who praise and blame do not consider whether the person's conduct has been advantageous or disadvantageous ; nay, they, in many instances, set it down on the score of praise, that, overlooking his own interests, he wrought some deed of honour : thus they praise Achilles, because he came to aid the cause of his comrade Patroclus, with full knowledge that himself was fated to die ; it being in his power, [by withholding that aid,] to live. To him, however, a death such as this was the more honourable prize : but to live would have been advantageous.</p>

<note type="margin">7. The orator in each class must have <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοι­ ναὶ προ­ τάσεις</foreign>. </note> From what has been said, it is plain that the orator must first be in possession of propositions on the subject of each of these divisions, separately; for the

since all, as well in praising as in blaming, as well in exhorting as in dissuading, as well in accusing as in defending, attempt to evince not only the points I have mentioned, but likewise to prove respecting this good or bad, this honourable or dishonourable, this just or unjust, that it is, moreover, either great or small, whether speaking of the things independently, or comparing them respectively one with another: as this is the case, it is plain that it will be necessary to have propositions respecting the degrees of great and small, of greater and less, as well general, as peculiar to each division: what good, for instance, is greater or less, what deviation from justice, or what conformity to it ; and so in the same way also respecting the other subjects. The points then have been stated, respecting which it will be absolutely necessary to get at propositions.

Let us, however, even on the present occasion, discuss such points as it is worth while to enlarge upon, and which still reserve the more full consideration for the science of social life: for nearly all the questions on which men deliberate and on which the deliberative orator harangues, those at least of the highest concernment, are in number five6; and these are questions of finance, of war andpeace, and again respecting the safeguard of territory, and respecting imports and exports ,respecting legislature.</p>

<note type="footnote" n="5"> The analytical science seems to have been the analysis of arguments. </note>

We may observe, then, a regular gradation in these five questions; though in his examination of them Aristotle proceeds analytically, and takes that which first presents itself in civilized society ; namely, the ways and means. Xenophon also, in his Memorabilia, represents Socrates as using nearly the same five subjects and arrangement, when dissuading Glaucon, a young Athenian, from attempting politics too early. Perhaps Aris. totle may have borrowed the hint from him. Cf. Xenoph. Mem. lib. iii. c. 6 : and a translation of the whole passage in the posthumous works of Dr. Franklin, vol. v. p. 77. Lond. 1819.

what and how great they may be; in order that, if any branch is overlooked, it may be added to the rest; and, if any be in default, it may be augmented. Moreover he should be acquainted with the whole expenditure of the state, that if any expense be superfluous it may be curtailed; if any too high, it may be reduced. For men become more wealthy, not only by adding to their capital stock, but by detracting from their expenses as well. These, however, are points which we must not only learn from our own experience as individuals ; but, with a view to deliberation on these subjects, one ought to be qualified by a research into the discoveries made by other people.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">9. ii. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πό­ λεμοςκαὶ είρήνη</foreign>. War and peace. </note> Respecting questions of war and peace, the orator must needs be acquainted with the force of the state, how great it actually is already, and how great it admits of becoming; of what description also it is already, and what additions admit of being made to it. Moreover he should know both what wars the state has been engaged in, and how it has conducted them. This must he needs know, not in relation to his own state only, but as regards frontier states also; particularly in the case of those with whom there is a likelihood of being at war, in order that toward the more powerful, pacific measures may be held, and that in regard to the weaker, it may rest with his own state to make war or not. He should also be acquainted with the description of force which belongs to each state, whether it resemble or differ? from his own; for it is possible, even in this respect, to secure an advantage to yourself, or to have one taken by the enemy. In order to all which things, the orator must necessarily have considered with attention the wars, not of his own state only, but those also of others, what has been their issue; for it is natural that from similar causes similar results should accrue.

But known it must be, in order that if any garrison be weak, it may be reinforced; if any be unnecessary, it may be done away, and the force may rather maintain positions strictly adapted to defence.</p>
<p>Again, on the subject of provision, the orator

<note type="margin"> 11. iv. Provision, i. e. imports and exports. </note> should know how great a consumption is sufficient to subsist the state, and of what kind that is which arises at home, and what is imported; and those nations whose exports there is need of, and those to whose markets he wants to import his home productions, in order that commercial treaties and agree- ments may be entered into with them. [All this should the orator be acquainted withj, because it is absolutely necessary strictly topreserve your citizens from any ground of quarrel in two of their relations, viz. in respect to those physically their superiors8, and those who may be serviceable in afore- mentioned points.</p>

things peculiar to itself; because, with the exception of the most excellent form of government, every other, by being relaxed or strained too much, destroys itself. Thus a democracy, not only when relaxed, but even when overstrained, grows weaker, and thus will at last be brought an oligarchy.

<p>So many then are the questions of highest concern touching which the deliberative orator must be in possession of propositions. We will, however, again discuss the elements out of which it is proper to exhort and dissuade, as well on these as on other questions.

Let us then, for the sake of getting at a received standard, ascertain what happiness, generally speaking, is ; and what are its constituents; for on the subject of it, and what conduces to it, and of its opposites, exhortation or dissuasion is always conversant; and this, because we needs do the things which procure it or any of its constituents, or which render it greater from having been less, and refrain from doing the things which destroy or impede it, or produce its opposites.</p>

<note type="margin"> ii. Individual. </note> Considered in reference to individuals, noble birth is derivable from male or female ancestry, and legitimacy on both sides ; and, just as in the case of a state, to have had the first of their line well known on the score of virtue, wealth, or any other valued quality; and for many of their kindred to have been illustrious, as well men as women, as well young as old :—

In reference to individuals, a good and numerous offspring consists in your own children being numerous, and they, as well male as female, such as I have described.

The constituent parts ofhonour are sacrifices,—monumental inscriptions, in metre or prose,—rewards,—consecrated pieces of ground6,— precedence,—public burial,—statues,—pensions from the state; those received among barbarians areprostration,—giving place7. The presents also usual among each people are, with them, respectively marks of honour; for a present is at once the gift of property, and a mark of honour. Wherefore it is that the avaricious are equally desirous of these, as the ambitious ; because they convey to both that which they desire, since at once it is a property, the object which the avaricious desire, and includes honour, the object of the ambitious.</p>

exertion, and swiftness as well. But the comeliness of one who has attained life's prime, is a person adapted tothe fatigues of war, with an'aspect to be looked uponwith pleasure tempered by awe. That of the old consists in the body being capable of the fatigues which it needs must undergo, and exempt withal from pain, by reason that it has none of the afflictions by which an old age is disfigured. Strength

<note type="margin"> 12. Strength </note> is the capability of moving another at will: you move another, of course, either by dragging, or shoving, or lifting, or crushing him ; so that the man who is endowed with strength, is requisitely so for some, if not for all these purposes. Excellence of stature,

<note type="margin"> 13. Stature. </note> is the exceeding the generality in height, substance, and breadth, in such a ratio as not, by reason of that excess, to render one s motions 

<note type="margin"> 14. Gymnastic excellence. </note> more tardy. Gymnastic excellence of person is made up of stature, strength, and speed; for the swift is also endued with strength : for he who is able to throw out his legs in a particular way, and move them rapidly, and in a forward direction, is fit for running ; but he who can crush and grapple with an adversary, is fit for wrestling ; while he who can send him forward by a blow, is the man for boxing : but if any be endued with the two latter qualifications, he is fit for a pancratiast; while he who has all three may contend in the pentathlum.</p>
<p>A good old age is an old age slow in approach, un-

<note type="margin"> 15. Good old age. </note> attended by pain ; for neither is it a good old age if one grows rapidly old ; nor if he does so slowly, indeed, but painfully: this blessing, however, is of the number both of the excellencies of the body and of fortune. For one who is neither unmolested by sickness, nor endued with strength, will not be exempt from sufferings ; and his days will be but few, and those not void of pain: nor without good fortune will he hold out at all. Indeed, independently both of strength and health there is means of long life ; for many, without the excellencies of the body, are long-lived. But accuracy of statement on these subjects makes nothing to our present purpose.</p>

<note type="margin"> 16. Friends. </note> In what number and excellence of friends consists is not doubtful, it having been distinctly stated, respecting a friend, that he is a friend who exerts himself to do for another whatever he esteems good for him, solely for the other's sake. He to whom many are so affected, has numerous friends; he to whom worthy men, has excellent friends.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">17. Good fortune. </note> Good fortune is the accession, and actual possession, either of all, of most, or the greatest of those goods of which chance is the cause. Now chance is the cause of some things about which there are arts conversant9; of many things, too, unrecognised by art; for instance, of whatever things nature is a cause; for it is possible that they should happen contrarily to nature : for art is a cause of health ; nature, of comeliness and stature. In a word, those goods proceed from chance, about which envy is felt 10. Chance is also a cause of those goods which baffle all calculation ; when, for instance, one is handsome, the rest of whose brothers are ugly ; or when every one else overlooked a treasure, and he found it; or if a weapon hit one's neighbour and not one's self; or if he alone, who used always to frequent a place, did not come there, while they who came then only were destroyed; for all such things appear to be pieces of good luck.</p>

<note type="margin">18. Virtue. </note> As to moral excellence, since that topic is most intimately connected with praise11, we must lay down distinctions respecting it when we treat of the subject of praise. It is then plain at what objects we ought to aim in exhorting, as likely to take place,or

<p>Let good, then, be defined to be, 1. Whatever is an object of choice independently, for its own sake; 2. and for the sake of which we choose something else. 3. What every thing aims at1, or every thing which has perception, or which has intelligence; or every thing would aim at, were it possessed of intelligence. 4. Whatever intelligence would award to each. 5. Whatever the intelligence conversant with every instance awards to each, that to each individual is his good. 6. That which being present, one is well disposed and independent. 7. Independency. 8. Whatever produces or preserves such advantages2; 9. and that on which they are consequent. 10. Whatever, too, has a tendency to prevent or destroy their opposites. Now, things are consequent in two ways;

<note type="margin"> 3. Consequences are twofold. </note> for either they may be consequent simultaneously or subsequently.—Knowledge, for instance, is a consequent on learning subsequently; life is so on health simultaneously. Again, things are productive in

<p>

<note type="margin">4. Indisputable goods. </note> These things being laid down, it must be of course that acquisitions of good, and the exemptions from evil, are good; for on the one is consequent the non-possession of evil simultaneously; on the other, the possession of good subsequently.</p>
<p>

<note type="chapter">5. </note> And the acquisition of a greater instead of a less good; of a less evil instead of a greater; for this becomes an acquisition of the one and an exemption from the other, in the ratio of the excess of the

<note type="chapter"> 6. </note> greater above the less. The virtues also must of course be a good, for in reference to them are their possessors well-disposed4; they are also productive of goods, and bear on moral conduct: respecting each, however, severally what, and of what kind it is,

<note type="chapter"> 7. </note> must be distinctly treated. It must be also that pleasure is a good, for all living things naturally desire it. Thus, too, things pleasant and honourable must needs be good; for the first are productive of pleasure ; while, of things honourable, some are pleasant, and the rest are by themselves objects of

<note type="chapter"> 8. </note> choice on their own account, So that to speak of them severally, it must be that the following things are good.—Happiness; for it is both an object of choise by itself, and independent, and for the sake of it

<note type="footnote" n="4"> We may observe of Aristotle's several enumerations of
<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδη</foreign>, that he usually refers a few instances of earliest 
rence to the respective definitions or axioms at the outset of the subject, by virtue of which they belong to the class to which he assigns them. Thus, in the enumeration of good here instituted, he refers to his general canons of good which have just been admitted; e. g. virtue may be classed among goods, by virtue of def. 5 and 7. It would be useful to pursue the comparison, if not through all the instances quoted, at least through the greater part of them ; since it will at once serve the purpose of impressing on the memory his leading examples, and of helping us to a fuller acquaintance with his theory. </note>

<p>But in the case of questionable goods, your reason-

<note type="chapter"> 19. </note> ings will be deduced from these formulae,—that of which the contrary is an evil, is itself a good ; as is that of which the contrary is expedient to an enemy : for example, if your being cowards be above all things expedient to your enemies, it is plain, that to the citizens your courage will be above all things beneficial. And, in a word, whatever be the things

<note type="chapter"> 20. </note> which the enemy desires and in which they rejoice, the contrary of those things appear beneficial; and hence was it well said ;—

<note type="chapter"> 26. </note> choice are good. And men determinately choose to do both the things which have been mentioned, and those which are evil to foes and good to friends ; and those which are possible-these are varied in two ways ; such as may be done, and such as may easily

<note type="chapter"> 27. </note> be done12 . Easy things are such as are done either without pain, or in a short time ; for difficulty is defined in reference either to the pain, or length of time. And men choose what is done as they wish ; and they wish what either is in no respect an evil, or in a less degree than it is good. This will occur in the case of unjust action, where the punishment either escapes notice or is trifling : and such actions as are

<note type="chapter"> 28. </note> peculiar ; as no one has done ; or which are extraordinary, for thus is their value greater : and those things which have an adaptation to ourselves; of which kind are things belonging to us in respect of family, and power.

And if the

<note type="footnote" n="3"> This qualification is absolutely necessary to the truth of the position; for it may happen, if the plurality be not of things of the same species as the less number, that the less number is of higher value than the greater.

Things are consequent simultaneously, as life on health ; but it is not consequent on life: and subsequently, as knowledge on learning; virtually, as larceny on sacrilege; for the man who has committed sacrilege would be ready also

greater degree [than itself], are greater6; for of necessity

<note type="chapter">7. </note> they exceed even the greater. T hings productive of a greater good are greater, for this would be by virtue of their being productive of something greater. That, too, the productive cause of which is greater, is likewise greater; for if that which is healthy, be preferable to, and a greater good than, that which is pleasant; then also will health be superior

for the one is for the sake of something else, the other, for its own sake; thus is exercise inferior to a good habit of body 7. That too is a greater good which in

And whenever one thing does not exist, nor can possibly

<note type="chapter">11. </note> be brought into existence independently of another, but that other can without it; then that which needs not the accession, is more independent, and thus shows itself to be a greater good. Again, if one be

because the end, and not the principle, was above stated to be the greater. Just like the saying of Leodamus in impeaching Callistratus, " that the man who devised the deed was worse than he who executed it; for had he not devised it, the other could not have executed it:" and conversely, against Chabrias, he argued that " the agent was worse than the deviser; for had there not been an agent, it would not have been realized in action, because people devised plots on this very account, that others may

<note type="chapter">14. </note> execute them." The morerare good is greater than the abundant11 ; thus gold is better than steel, notwithstanding that it is less useful; for the acquisition, by reason of its being more difficult, is greater. And in another view, the abundant is better than the rare, for the enjoy ment of ---It exceeds that of the other; for the idea of often exceeds that of seldom; whence

Virtue, too, is greater than what is not positive virtue, and vice than what is not positive vice; for the former

Also of whatever things the excellencies and deficiencies are of greater importance, of them are also the productions of greater importance: since results stand to each other in the same ratio, as their several causes and principles; and, vice versa, causes and principles, in the ratio of their several results. Things,

<note type="chapter"> 18. </note> tile excess or which is preferable or more becoming, as accuracy of sight is preferable to that of smelling, for sight is preferable to smelling; and the being greatly attached to friends is more becoming than to be greatly attached to money13, so that attachment to friends is more becoming than fondness for money. And conversely, too, the excesses of better feelings are themselves better: and of the more becoming, themselves, more becoming: as, too, are those things of

<note type="chapter"> 19. </note> which the desires are better or more becoming; tor the greater desire is of the greater object: and, for the same reason, the desires which fasten on the more excellent and becoming objects, are themselves more excellent and becoming. Again, where the sciences

<note type="chapter"> 20. </note> are more grave or becoming, there the subject-matter also is more grave and becoming; for, as is the science, so is its truth; for each science takes cognisance of its peculiar truths: and analogous to this precedence of subjects is that also of the sciences, which recognise graver and more becoming subjects, above the rest; for the same reasons. And that which men of practical

<note type="chapter"> 21. </note> wisdom, or every person, or the generality, or the majority, or the best of men have, or would have pronounced to be a greater good; that of course must be such, either absolutely, or so far at least as they decided conformably to their prudence. This, too, is a test available in common to the other questions about good; for their substance, quantity, and quality, have themselves so as science and prudence may direct; on this subject however we have treated. For that has been defined to be good which every

being, if fraught with prudence14, would choose; wherefore it is evident, that what prudence pronounces

<note type="chapter"> 22. </note> good in a high degree is a greater good. Also that which belongs to the better men, either absolutely, or in respect of their being better; as courage is better than strength. Also what the better man would make the object of his choice, either absolutely or in respect of its being better; as, the suffering rather than the doing an injury, for this would he choose

<note type="chapter"> 23. </note> who is more just. And that which conduces more to pleasure rather that what conduces less; because every being pursues pleasure, and is desirous of enjoying it for its own sake; now it is in reference to this, that the good and the end have been defined: that is said to conduce more to pleasure, which is conducive to it with less alloy of pain, and for a

<note type="chapter"> 24. </note> greater length of time. That which is more becoming rather than what is less so; for the becoming either is that which tends to please, or is desirable on

<note type="chapter"> 25. </note> its own account. Whatever things people prefer being the causes of to themselves or to their friends, those are greater goods; but whatever they would

<note type="chapter"> 26. </note> least wish, are greater evils. Things whose duration is long, rather than those whose duration is short; and those which are more secure, rather than those which are less so: for there is an advantage in their enjoyment; of the former, in respect to time; of the latter, from their being at will: for the enjoyment of what is secure is more in their power whenever

<note type="chapter">27. </note> they wish. And as are the terms arising from conjugates and similar inflections, so are the qualities they denote; for example, if courageously be an idea more noble and desirable than temperately, courage will also be something more noble than temperance, and the idea of a man's being courageous than of his

<note type="chapter">28. </note> being temperate. What every one chooses is better than what some do not, as also is the choice of a majority better than that of a minority; for as that was supposed a good which all desire, so that is propor-

tionately greater which is more desired. That, too, which litigants or foes, judges, or arbitrators selected by judges, prefer, is better ; for in one case the decision is equivalent to that of all mankind; and in the other, men of authority and information actually do pronounce. And sometimes good is greater in which

<note type="chapter"> 29. </note> all participate; tor not to participate in it is a disgrace : while at others, that is which none, or which few share with you; for it is more rare. Things

<note type="chapter"> 30. </note> more commended, because more becoming; and in the same way things are better to which belongs the greater honour, because honour is as a kind of estimate of worth. Those things again are more heinous on which are imposed the greater punishments. Again, what is greater than things confessedly or apparently

<note type="chapter"> 31. </note> great, is itself superior in greatness. And the same objects, when separated into their several constituents, have an air of superior greatness, for the excess of a plurality of objects is conspicuous. Whence the poet says that Meleager's wife persuaded him to rise up to the war by entering into detail:­ " She paints the horrors of a conquer'd town, The heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown, The matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved15." Iliad ix. 705. Again, the condensing and accumulating of circumstances in the way Epicharmus used to do, is productive of effect, and that on the same principle as their separation; viz. because the condensing of them evinces great excess, and for the further reason, that it appears a principle and a cause of great results. But as that is greater which is more rare and difficult,

<note type="chapter"> 32. </note> circumstances both of opportunity, and age, and place, and time, and strength, produce great effect. 15 Another striking instance of the effect produced by a detail of circumstances may be found in the Septem contra Thebas of Aeschylus, 302, ed.

The constituent parts of virtue are justice, courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality,

Thus expressed the sentiment has the force of a suggestion ; but thus, of commendation, " thinking highly, not of goods which were his by chance, but those obtained by his own means."

To conclude out of general rules and axioms by discourse of wit our duties in every particular action, is both troublesome, and many times so full of difficulty, that it maketh deliberations hard and tedious to the wisest men. Whereupon we naturally all incline to observe examples, to mark what others have done before us, and, in favour of our own ease, rather to follow them, than to enter into a new consultation, if in regard of their virtue and wisdom we may but probably think they have waded without error.

Now the act of

But to carry on distinctions in reference to age, or habits, or whatever else enacts itself in conduct, were superfluous. For, granting that it happens to young men to be passionate, it is not by motion of their youth that they act thus, but by motion of anger and appetite: neither is it by motion either of wealth or poverty, simply, but <stage>(in the case of the poor)</stage> it is on account of their neediness that it happens that they cherish an appetite for wealth; and <stage>(in the case of the rich)</stage> on account of their having the means, that they risk an appetite for unnecessary pleasure ; and these persons will act neither by motion of their wealth nor of their poverty, but by motion of appetite. And in exactly the same way, the just and unjust, and all such as are said to act conformably to habits, will in reality act, under all circumstances, by motion of these principles ; for they on the impulse either of reason or of passion; but some from good manners and passions, others from the contrary. Still, however, it happens that on habits of this particular

For I also set down the getting quit either of evils or apparent evils, and the getting a less evil in exchange for a greater, in the class of goods; because they are in a certain way desirable things. And, among things pleasant, I likewise set down the getting quit of things bringing pain, or appearing to do so; or the getting things

<note type="margin"> 4. All freedom " from constraint. </note> compulsion is contrary to nature. Wherefore acts of necessity are painful; and it has been truly remark- A " Every act of necessity is in its nature painful." It must be also that a state of sedulous attention, anxiety, the having the mind on the stretch, are painful, for they all are acts of necessity, and constrained, unless they have become habitual; but it is custom which, under such circumstances, renders them pleasant. The contraries of these must also be pleasant; wherefore, relaxation of mind, leisure, listlessness, amusements, and intervals of rest, rank in the class of things pleasant; for none of these has any thing to do with necessity. Every thing of

<note type="margin"> 6. Appetites are pleasant. </note> which there is an innate appetite, is pleasant; for appetite is a desire of what is pleasant. Now, of appetites, some are irrational, others attended by reason. I call all those irrational, which men desire, not from

<note type="margin"> Irrational. </note> any conception which they form: of this kind are all which are said to exist naturally, as those of the body; thirst or hunger, for instance, in the case of sustenance; and the appetite of sustenance in every kind. And the appetites connected with objects of taste, and of lust, and, in fact, objects of touch generally ; the appetite of fragrant odours, too, as connected with smelling, and hearing, and sight. Appetites

<note type="margin"> Rational. </note> attended by reason, are all those whatsoever which men exercise from a persuasion: for many things there are which they desire to behold, and possess, on hearsay and persuasion. Now, as the being

<note type="margin"> 6. Hope and memory are pleasant. </note> pleased stands in the perception of a certain affection, and as imagination is a kind of faint perception, there will attend on him who exercises either memory or hope, a kind of imagination of that which is the object of his memory or hope; but if so, it is plain that they who exercise memory or hope, certainly feel pleasure, since they have also a perception. So that every thing pleasant consists either in the

<note type="chapter"> 7. </note> perception of present objects, or in the remembrance of those which have already been, or in the hope of such as are yet to be; for men exercise perception
<pb n="74"/>

<note type="margin"> [ BOOK I. </note>
on present, memory on past, and hope on future objects.

<note type="chapter"> 8. </note> Now the objects of memory are pleasant, not only such as at the moment while present were pleasant, but some even which were not pleasant, should their consequence subsequently be honourable and good ; and hence this saying, " But it is indeed pleasant for a man, when preserved, to remember his toils ;" and this, " For after his sufferings, a man who has suffered much, and much achieved, is gladdened at the recollection." But the reason of this is, that to be exempt from evil is

<note type="chapter"> 9. </note> pleasant1. And all objects are pleasant in hope, which appear by their presence either to delight or benefit in a great degree ; or to benefit, without giving pain. In a word, whatever objects by their presence delight us, do so, generally speaking, as we hope for, or remember them. On which account, too, the feeling of anger is pleasant; just as Homer has remarked of anger in his poem, " That which with sweetness far greater than distilling honey as it drops for there is no one who feels anger where the object seems impracticable to his revenge ; nor with those far their superiors in power do men feel anger at all, or if they do, it is in a less degree.

<note type="chapter"> 10. </note> There is also a kind of pleasure consequent on most appetites; for either in the recollection that they have enjoyed them, or in the hope that they shall enjoy them, men are affected and delighted by a certain pleasure: thus men possessed by fevers feel delight, amid their thirst, as well at the remembrance how they used to drink, as at the hope of drinkinsr

<note type="margin"> Criterion of love. </note> And this is in all cases a criterion of the commencement of love, when persons feel pleasure not only in the presence of the object, but are enamoured also of

<note type="margin"> 12. Sorrow. </note> it when absent, on memory; wherefore, even when

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XI.] </note>
pain arises at absence, nay in the midst of mourning, and the very dirge of death, there yet arises within us a certain pleasure. For the pain is felt because the object is not present; but the pleasure consists in remembering and seeing, as it were, both the person, and what he used to do, and the kind of character of which he was. Whence has it been said, and with probability enough, "Thus spake he, and excited within them all a desire of lamentation." Also the

<note type="margin"> 13. Revenge. </note> avenging one's self is pleasant2; for the getting of that is pleasant, the failing to get which is painful: now the angry do feel pain in an excessive degree if they be not avenged ; but in the hope of revenge they take pleasure. Again, to overcome is pleasant, not to the

<note type="margin"> 14. Vietory. </note> ambitious only, but even to all; for there arises an imagination of superiority, for which all, either in a faint or more violent degree, have an appetite. But

<note type="margin"> 15.Hence, amusements. </note> since to overcome is pleasant, it must follow of course, that amusements where there is field for rivalry, as those of music and disputations, are pleasant ; for it frequently occurs, in the course of these, that we overcome; also chess, ball, dice, and draughts. Again, it is the same with respect to amusements where a lively interest is taken3; for, of these, some become pleasant as accustomed to them; others are pleasant at first; for instance, hunting and every kind of sporting ; for where there is rivalry, there is also victory; on which principle the disputations of the bar and of the schools are pleasant to those who have become accustomed to them, and have abilities. Also honour and good character are most

<note type="margin"> 16. Honour and character. </note> pleasant, by reason that an idea arises, that one is such as is the good man ; and this in a greater degree should those people pronounce one such, who

he think speaks truth: such are those immediately about one, rather than those who are more removed; familiar friends, and acquaintances, and one's fellow citizens, rather than those who are at a distance; the present, rather than a future generation ; a man of practical wisdom, rather than a mere ignoramus ; many, than a few; for it is more likely that these I have mentioned will adhere to the truth, than that the opposite characters will: since one has no anxiety about the honour or the opinions of such as one greatly despises, children and animals for instance, not at least for the sake of such opinion itself; but if one is anxious about it, then it is on account of

<note type="margin"> 17. Friends. </note> something else. A friend, too, ranks among things pleasant; for the affection of love is pleasant; since there is no lover of wine, who does not delight in wine: also the having affection felt toward one is pleasant; for there is in this case also an idea of one's being an excellent person, which all who have any sensibility to it are desirous of; now' the having affection felt for you is the being beloved yourself,

To vary is also pleasant; for change is an approach to what is natural: for sameness produces an excess of a stated habit; whence it has been said, " In every thing change is pleasant5." For on this principle, whatever occurs at intervals of time is pleasant, whether persons or things; for

<note type="footnote" n="4"> It may be interesting to compare the grounds on which Dr. Johnson considered flattery pleasant with these of Aristotle.

it is a variation of present objects; and at the same time that which occurs merely at intervals possesses the merit of rarity. Also learning and admiration,

<note type="margin"> 21. Learning : admiration. </note> generally speaking, are pleasant; for under admiration exists a desire [to learn], so that what is admired is desired: and in the act of learning there is a settlement into a state conformable to nature. To benefit

<note type="margin"> 22. To do good: to receive good. </note> and to be benefited are also of the number of pleasant things ; for to be benefited, is to get what people desire ; but to benefit, is to possess and abound ; things, the both of which men desire. And because a tendency to beneficence is pleasant6, it is also pleasant to a man to set his neighbour on his legs again, and to put a finish to that which was deficient in some particular. But as the acquisition of knowledge

<note type="margin"> 23. Imitation. </note> is pleasant, and the feeling admiration, and such things; that, too, must necessarily be pleasant which has been expressed in imitation, as in painting,

<note type="margin"> Painting Sculpture. Poetry. </note> sculpture, and poetry: also, every thing is pleasant which has been correctly imitated, although the original object, of which it is the imitation, may not in itself be pleasant; for one does not feel pleasure on that account; but there is an inference that " this means that and thus it happens that we learn something.

<note type="margin"> 25. Sumlarity and conformity to nature and ourselves. </note> saved from danger narrowly; for all these are cases exciting admiration. Again, since that is pleasant which is conformable to nature, and things which are akin are respectively conformable to nature, every thing like and akin, speaking generally, is pleasant;

<note type="footnote" n="6"> This principle of pleasure has been thus developed by Hooker: " As to love them of whom we receive good things is a duty, because they satisfy our desires in that which else we should want; so to love them on whom we bestow is nature, because in them we behold the effects of our own virtue."—Ecc. Pol. v. § 63, p. 285.

<note type="chapter"> 26. </note> together;" and every other saying of this sort. But as every thing like and akin is delightful to it, and as every one stands to himself in this relation in a most special manner, all must be, more or less, lovers of themselves; for all these qualities do in a particular manner exist in reference to self. But as all are lovers of themselves, that necessarily which is their own must be pleasant to all; as, for instance, their sayings and productions. On which account men are in general fond of flatterers and lovers, and are ambitious and fond of children; for children are their own production8. It is also pleasant to put a finish to what is deficient9; for it became by that

<note type="margin"> 27.Power. </note> time one a own production. And as rule is the most pleasant of all things, the appearing to be wise is also pleasant; for knowledge is a principle of power;

<note type="margin"> Wisdom. Censure. </note> and wisdom is a knowledge of many subjects, and those commanding admiration. Moreover, as men in general are ambitious, the power of rebuking one's

<note type="margin"> 28. Dwelling on one's own excellencies. </note> neighbour must needs be pleasant. Also the pausing on that province in which he appears to be best, when compared with his own powers in other respects; just as Euripides remarks, "And this he plies, allotting the greatest part of each day to it,

COMMENCING from this point, let me mark in detail all acts which conform to, or which violate justice.

The general law. </note> Law2, now, I understand, to be either peculiar or universal; peculiar, to be that which has been marked out by each people in reference to itself, and that this is partly unwritten, partly written.

ascertain what is just, honourable, and expedient; arid when that is discovered, it is proclaimed as a general ordinance, equal and impartial to all. This is the origin of law, which, for various reasons, all are under an obligation to obey, but especially because all law is the invention and gift of Heaven, the sentiment of wise men, the correction of every offence, and the general compact of the state; to live in conformity with which is the duty of every individual in society.

intuitively divine, even should no intercourse with each other, nor any compact have existed4; which sentiment the Antigone of Sophocles enters uttering, that it was just, namely to bury Polynices, though denounced, since this by nature was a deed of justice: " For by no means is it for this or the next day merely that this maxim is in force, but for ever; nor is there any one who knows from whom it proceeded5. And as Empedocles says on the subject of not slaying that which has life: for this maxim is not right here, and wrong there, "but a principle of law to all, it is extended uninterruptedly throughout the spacious firmament and boundless light." And as Alcidamas remarks in the Messeniac oration.</p>

And hence we may, as regards acts of justice, and the contrary, violate justice or adhere to it in two ways; for we may do so in reference either to an individual, or to the community: for the man who is guilty of

Now as all acts of violating justice have been distinguished, and as some of them are against the community, and others against one or more individual members of it, let me, after reverting to what the suf-

<note type="chapter"> 5. </note> fering injustice is, explain the rest. Now to be injured, is to suffer injustice at the hands of a willing agent;

<note type="chapter"> 6. </note> for commission of injustice has been previously defined to be a voluntary act. As however it is necessary that the person injured should be hurt, and involuntarily hurt. Now what hurt is will be evident from what has gone before; for things good and evil have been distinctly spoken of above, and voluntary acts also ; namely. that they are all things done know-

<note type="chapter"> 7. </note> ingly. So that all grounds for complaint must exist, necessarily in reference either to the community, or to individual interests; the agent being either unconscious, or unwilling, or willing and conscious; and [in the last] of these cases, acting either on deliberate

<note type="chapter"> 8. </note> choice, or on the impulse of passion. Now I shall treat on the subject of anger in my discussion of the passions ; but it has been above explained under what circumstances, and with what dispositions, men act on deliberate principle.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">9. We must know the definition of the various acts of injustice. </note> But as people, while they acknowledge their having acted in such a way, very frequently will not acknowledge the designation in the indictment, or the view of the case on which the indictment turns : a man will avow, for example, his having taken a thing, but not his having stolen it; that he struck the first blow, but yet did not insult; that he cohabited, but did not commit adultery, with the woman in question; or that he stole, but was not guilty of sacrilege, for it was not consecrated property ; or that he did till beyond his boundary, but encroached not upon public land ; or conversed with the enemy, but was yet not guilty of treason: it will, for these reasons, be necessary to lay down definitions on these matters ; as to what essentially constitutes theft, insult, and adultery; in order that, if we wish to show that they really do or do not exist, we may be able

<note type="chapter"> 10. </note> to set the right of the case in a true light. Now all

these questions, as to a matter being unjust and criminal, or not unjust, do in fact constitute the ground of inquiry; for the criminality and injustice of the act stands essentially in the deliberate principle on which it is done ; and this sort of terms marks, over and above the matter of fact, the principle also of the agent; the terms, assault and felony, for instance ; for because a man has struck another, he will not under all circumstances have assaulted him, but if he has done so with a view to something, as with a view to treat him with disrespect, or to his own gratification : neither, supposing a man has taken privily, has he been guilty, in every case, of larceny; but if he took it to the injury of another, or in order to appropriate it to himself, then indeed he has been guilty of larceny. The case too is similar respecting other terms designating crimes to what has been remarked respecting these.</p>
<p>But as there were two species of things right and

<note type="chapter"> 11. </note> wrong ; for one was of written prescript, the other of unwritten law ; now those on the subject of which the laws speak a written language have been treated of; and of those arising from unwritten law there are

two kinds. And these are, the one class which is always in proportion to the excess of vice or virtue of the agent, on which are consequent either censures and praises, or deprivation of rank and marks of distinction and public grants ; thus, for instance, the being grateful to a benefactor, and the repaying with kindness one who has been kind to yourself, and the having an inclination to aid one's friends, and whatever other duties are of this kind: the other

tradiction happens, partly indeed against the will, and partly with the will of the legislator: it then happens against his will, when the question may have escaped his notice ; but, with his will, whenever he has it not in his power accurately to make distinction, but it is necessary that he pronounce universally, though the case be not so absolutely without exceptions, but generally only. Thus also in respect to all cases about which, by reason of their infinitude, it is not easy to make distinctions; such, with regard to wounding with steel, are the distinctions as to the size and nature of the instrument, for an age would

<note type="chapter"> 14. </note> fail one in the enumeration. Be it then that the case admits not such distinctions, yet if one must needs enact a law respecting it, he cannot do otherwise than speak in general terms 9; so that one who has so much as a ring on his finger, and lifts up his hand and strikes you, does by the letter of the written law stand guilty, and acts unjustly; but in real truth he does not act unjustly 10; and this is the equity of the

<note type="footnote"> between man and man, that, to the utter undoing of some, many things by strictness of law may be done, which EQUITY and HONEST MEANING forbiddeth. Not that the LAW is unjust, but imperfect; nor equity against, but above the law, binding men's consciences in things which the law cannot reach unto. Will any man say that the virtue of private equity is opposite and repugnant to that law, the silence whereof it supplieth in all such private dealing? No more is public equity against the law of public affairs; albeit, the one permit unto some, in special considerations, that which the other, agreeably with general rules of justice, doth in general sort forbid. For, sith all good laws are the voices of right reason, which is the instrument wherewith God will have the world guided, and impossible it is that right should withstand right; it must follow that principles and rules of justice, be they never so generally uttered, do no less effectually intend, than if they did plainly express, an exception of all particulars, wherein their literal practice might any way prejudice equity.

case. Now if equity be what it has been stated to

<note type="margin"> 15. Equity consists in fellow- feeling. </note> be, it will be evident what kind of things are equitable, and what not so ; also what kind of persons are not equitable. Since in whatever cases one is bound to have a fellow-feeling, these are all cases of equity. Again, equity is the not esteeming faults and crimes

<note type="chapter"> 16. </note> of equal guilt, nor accidents, and faults. Now accidents are whatever things happen against all calculation, and proceed not from criminal principle ; and faults are whatever things do not happen against calculation, nor proceed from criminal principle ; but crimes are whatever things, not falling out contrary to calculation, proceed from criminal principle; for the things which are done through desire, proceed from criminal principle. Equity also is the having a

Now these criteria arise from the actions virtually exceeding; for he who stole three half farthings of consecrated money would cheat one in any thing.

And that the judge is, as it were, an assay-master, that he may distinguish between counterfeit and real ideas of justice. And that it is the part of a better

He should insist also, that no one chooses good in the abstract, but what is so to himself; and that there is no difference between a law not enacted and one not put in force.

Now in order to set them out as deserving credit or undeserving it, there is no difference from the process respecting witnesses. For of whatever characters those who have subscribed, or had the custody11 of the deeds, happen to be, of the same authority will the deeds themselves also be. When, however, the deeds are acknowledged to have been made, we must, in case they be on our side, aggrandize their authority; for a deed is law, private and particular12. And deeds

But should the deeds be opposed to you, and on the side of your adversary, these arguments will be to your purpose: -first, those with which one would contend against a law which made against him ; for it is absurd if we think we are not bound to obey the laws, unless well enacted, and if the legislators have been guilty of mistaking their point, but yet hold it necessary to abide by mere deeds. Next to argue that the judge is an

And that it is not possible to alter what is just, either by fraud or force ; for it has an existence in the nature of things13 : deeds, how-

Observe, moreover, whether it be in opposition to any written law, or any universal principle of right, and to the principles of justice and honour; whether again it be opposed to other later or earlier deeds; for either the later are valid, and the earlier invalid ; or the earlier are correct, and the later have been obtained by stratagem; urging whichever of these cases may happen to suit the purpose. Have an eye moreover to the matter of expediency, whether the deed stand in any respect in the way of the judges, and every other such consideration, for these may also be easily discovered.

Thus, then, his not taking it will be from virtuous motives, not from fear of forswearing himself; here, too, the saying of Xenophanes is in point, viz. that this sort of appeal, made by an impious man to a pious, is not fair, but is just such an one, as if a robust fellow were to challenge an infirm man, either to strike him, or to get beaten himself.</p>
<p>3. If, however, he accepts it, the advocate alleges

<note type="margin"> 30. ii. When he accepts it. </note> that he feels confidence in himself, but none in his adversary. Let him also declare, inverting the saying of Xenophanes, that it is fair enough if the impious man tenders the oath, and the pious man takes it; also, that it is surely a strange thing that a man should be unwilling himself to take an oath, in a question about which he calls on the judges to give their verdict on oath.</p>
<p>4. If, however, he tenders the oath, let him insist

<note type="margin"> 31. iv.

But as rhetoric has in

<note type="chapter"> 2. </note> view the coming to a decision <stage>(tor in deliberative oratory, the assembly arrive at decisions, and the sentence of a court of justice is ipso facto a decision)</stage> ; it is necessary to look not only to your speech, in what way that will be of a character to convince and persuade, but also to invest yourself with a certain kind of character, and the judge with a certain kind of feeling. For it is a point of great consequence,

<note type="chapter"> 3. </note> particularly in deliberative! cases ; and, next to these, in judicial; as well that the speaker seem to be a man of a certain character, as that his audience conceive him to be of a certain disposition toward themselves; moreover it is of consequence if your audience chance to be themselves also disposed in a certain way.

<note type="footnote" n="1"> Those subjects about which deliberative oratory is concerned, least of all admit any thing like absolute certainty, for we can only form conjectures of what will be from what has been; and Aristotle has already told us, " that men lend a readier and more implicit belief to the good on all questions whatsoever; but on those whose nature precludes our arriving at certainty, but compels us to remain in doubt, we rely entirely on them."

Now, as to a speaker's appearing to be himself of a certain character, this point is more available in deliberations : but the disposing the auditor in a certain way, in judicial cases ; for things do not show themselves in the same light to persons affected by love and by hatred, nor to those under emotions of anger, as to those who are disposed to placability; but they appear either utterly different in character, or at least different in degree. For to a judge who is affected by love toward the party respecting whom he pronounces his decision, that party appears either not at all to be unjust, or to be so in a very trivial degree. To a judge, however, who is affected by hatred, the case has a contrary appearance. So also to a person who is eager and sanguine, the proposed object, if pleasant, takes the appearance, as well of being likely to accrue, as of being likely to prove really a good ; while by one who is indifferent and reluctant, the opposite view is taken.</p>

Now, if anger be this, it must be that he who is affected by anger, is so affected invariably towards some individual <stage>(for instance, towards Cleon)</stage>, but not towards mankind2, generally: and this, because the individual has already wrought some indignity, either on himself or some of his friends, or in-

It must be also that there is a sort of pleasure consequent on all anger, arising out of the hope of avenging one's self3; for the idea of attaining what one desires is pleasant; and no one is desirous of objects which appear impracticable to him; and he who is under the affection of anger is desirous of objects which appear practicable to him. Wherefore it has been happily remarked of anger, that it is, " Far, far too dear to every mortal breast, Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste4.” Because a sort of pleasure is consequent on it, as well on this account, as because men linger in thought on compassing revenge. Now the phantasy which then arises excites a pleasure within us, as do the phanta-

But as a slight is the operation of an opinion conceived of an object which appears not worth consideration (for we esteem things absolutely bad, and those which are good, and what conduces to them, to be worth some consideration ; that however which is mere nothing, or absolutely trivial, we con-

There are three species of slight, contempt, vexatiousness, and contumely: for he who manifests contempt is guilty of a slight, since men contemn whatever they think worth nothing, and what is worth nothing, they slight. Again, he who is vexatious appears to contemn, for vexatiousness is a thwarting another's wishes, not that any thing may accrue to the person himself who so impedes, but in

order that something may not accrue to that other. Since, then, he slights not with a view to any advantage to himself, it is plain that he conceives you can neither hurt him, <stage>(for, if he did, he would be afraid, and would not be guilty of slight,)</stage> nor can benefit him in any respect worth mentioning, since he would otherwise hold you in consideration, in order to become your friend.<ref n="6"/> He, too, who acts contume-

<note type="chapter"> 6. </note> liously manifests slight; for contumely is the doing and saying those things about which the person who is the subject of this treatment, has feelings of delicacy, not with a view that any thing should accrue to himself, other than what arises to him in the act, but in order that he may be gratified; for they who requite an injury, do not act contumeliously, but take revenge. Now the cause of the pleasure felt by those

<note type="chapter"> 6. </note> who act contumeliously, is that, by injuring, they conceive themselves to be more decidedly superior: on which account young men and the rich are given to contumely, for in manifesting the contumely, they conceive themselves superior. To contumely belongs the withholding of respect; but he who withholds respect, manifests slight; for that which is of no value, is held in no consideration, either good or bad. On which principle Achilles, in his anger, says, " He hath withheld from me respect, for he hath seized and possesses my prize himself, having taken it from me." And again, " Like some unregarded vagabond ;" as though he were, on this account, affected by anger. Now people think it becoming that they

much superior: thus the rich man thinks to be looked up to by the poor, in regard to money; also the man who has a faculty of speaking, by him who is destitute of it, in the case of speaking ; and he who thinks himself worthy to bear office, by him who deserves to be subject to rule.

From hence it is by this time manifest both under what affections as regards themselves, and with what objects, and for what reasons, men feel anger. For as regards themselves, it is when they happen to be aggrieved, since he who is aggrieved is anxious for something. Now a man [will feel thus aggrieved], as well on any person's clashing with him in regard to any object, directly; when he is thirsty, for example, in regard to drinking: as also should they not directly clash, yet will he appear to do the same thing; and if a person thwarts, or does not co-operate with one, and if a person annoys one in any respect, when thus circumstanced, one feels anger against all these.

On which account seasons, times, dispositions, and ages, which class of them are readily excited to anger, and when, and how, will be plain from this which I have said ; also it will be plain that they are then excited with greater readiness, when more immediately influenced by these circumstances.

Also the letting a man escape our memory is a thing very apt to provoke anger; for example, the nearly forgetting even his name, since forgetfulness seems to be an indication of slight; because forgetfulness arises from disregard, and disregard is a kind of slight. Now, it has been told you against whom men feel anger, and under what dispositions, and why11. It evidently will be needful for an orator to work up his audience by his speech, into such a frame of mind as that under which men are prone to anger, and his adversary, too, as being obnoxious to that on account of which men feel anger, and as being such an one as people feel anger against.

<note type="chapter"> 4. </note> means they are appeased. Let placability, then, be defined to be " a subsiding and appeasement of anger1.” Now, if men feel anger towards those who slight them, and if slight be voluntary, it is plain that they are placable in regard to those who do no such thing, or who either do so, or appear to do so, involuntarily : towards those also who wish the contrary of what they do; and those who behave in the same way toward themselves also, for no one seems likely him-

Men are thus disposed also towards such as acknowledge and repent of their guilt; for taking their feeling of pain for what they have done as a punishment, they are appeased :-there is proof of this in the case of chastising servants; for we chastise more violently those who contradict us, and deny their guilt; but towards such as acknowledge themselves to be justly punished, we cease from our wrath2; the reason of which is, that the denial of what is evident is a sort of impudence, and impudence is slight and contempt: therefore we are not alive to sense of shame, in regard to those whom we despise very

contradict their imputations; for they appear to acknowledge themselves inferior ; but inferiors fear us, and no one who fears is guilty of slight.

<note type="chapter"> 9. </note> are not given to contumely, nor to jeering one; and who do not manifest slight towards any one, or towards those alone who are not good men, and not towards such as we ourselves are. In a word, we

<note type="chapter"> 10. </note> should consider the subject of placability, from the opposite of the doctrine of anger. Once more, it is

<note type="margin"> Whom we fear. </note> felt towards those whom men fear, or have a delicacy toward ; for so long as they are thus affected, they are not influenced by anger; since it is impossible to feel anger and fear at the same time. Again,

<note type="margin"> 11.

<note type="chapter"> 12. </note> is unattended by pain, anger, however, is so attended. Thus are they also disposed towards such as regard them with respect.</p>
<p>It is evident, also, that men are placable, when in a

For which reason, Philocrates, when some one asked him " how it was, as the populace were enraged with him, that he did not make his defence," very justly said, " I will not do it yet.”— " But when will you ?"—" I will do it, when I see some one else criminated." For people, after they have exhausted their anger on some other object, become placable ; which happened in the case of Ergophilus; for the populace, though more indignant with him than with Callisthenes, yet acquitted him, because, on the day before, they had condemned Cal-

<note type="chapter"> 14. </note> listhenes to death. Men are thus disposed if they have convicted the object, and if he have suffered a greater ill than they, with all their anger, would have themselves inflicted; for they think they have gotten, as it were, their revenge. Again, if they are aware that they are themselves unjust, and suffer de-

and this is plain from the definition. Hence is it said in the poem with great propriety, " Go, say 'twas Ulysses, subverter of cities," etc.; as though the hero had not been revenged, unless Polyphemus perceived both by whom6, and in return for what7, he suffered. So that men are not angry with any who are no longer sensible; neither any longer with those who are dead8, as being persons who have endured the extremity of suffering; nor with those who will not be susceptible of pain, nor feel the punishment inflicted, a point of which those affected by anger are desirous. On which account the poet, wishing to restrain Achilles from his anger against Hector now that he is dead, aptly says, " In his madness he is vexing a senseless clod."

<note type="margin">31. Six points of comparison between anger and hatred. </note> 1. Now anger arises out of something which has reference to ourselves; hatred, however, even independently of any thing having reference to ourselves, since if we conceive a person to be of a certain description, we bear hatred towards him. 2. And our anger invariably has reference to individual objects, as to Callias or Socrates ; but hatred may be borne even to whole classes; for every one hates the character of a thief and an informer. 3. Again, the one feeling is to be remedied by time; the other is incurable. 4. Also the first is a desire of inflicting pain on its object, the last of doing him deadly harm; for the angry man wishes to be felt9, to him who bears hatred this matters not; and all things which give pain may be felt; but what does harm in the highest degree, is least capable of being felt, for instance, injustice and folly, for the presence of vice does not at all pain [him to whom it is present]. 5. And anger is attended by pain, hatred is not; for he who is affected by anger is pained, but he who is affected by

From this, as from many other of its distinctive characteristics, ANGER will be confessed to be a more generous passion than HATRED. To this purpose Lord Bacon well remarks, that " Some, when they take revenge, are desirous the party should know whence it cometh : this is the more generous; for the delight scemeth to be not so much in doing the hurt, as in making the party repent; but base and crafty cowards are like the arrow that flieth in the dark."

The former, too, had many ills befallen the object of his anger, might be inclined to pity him; the latter would not, in any case; for the former wishes the object of his anger to suffer in his turn, the latter desires the extinction of the object of his hate10.

So that, to speak generally, all those things are to be feared, which, happening or being likely to happen in the case of others, excite compassion. The circumstances then of fear, and which men are alarmed at, those at least of greatest importance, are, as I may say, nearly those which I have enumerated: and now let me state under what dispositions, as regards themselves, men are susceptible of fear.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin"> 13. How those are affected that feel fear. </note> Now, if fear be attended by an apprehension of suffering some destructive evil, it is plain that none of those who consider that they shall not suffer any thing, is subject to fear; and that no one is subject to it, in regard to those things which he does not consider that he shall suffer; nor in regard to those persons at whose hands he does not apprehend any thing; nor at a time when he is without apprehensions. It must follow, therefore, that those are subject to fear, who apprehend they shall suffer something, and this in regard to the persons at whose hands, and the things which, and at the times when.

<note type="chapter"> 14. </note> they so apprehend. But neither are those who are, and who think themselves to be, in the midst of great good fortune, at all apprehensive of suffering any thing, <stage>(on which account they are contumelious, contemptuous, and rash; but it is wealth, strength, number of friends, power, which renders men of this temper,)</stage> nor those who think that already they have suffered the sum of all that is horrible7, and whose feelings have been chilled with respect to what awaits them, just as those who have been already beaten on the rack; but [in order to the existence of fear] there must needs arise some hope of safety, about

<note type="footnote" n="7"> Fuisset; Quern metui moritura? Aen. iv. 603. </note>
<pb n="125"/>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. V.] </note>
which men feel the painful anxiety8; and this is a proof of it, that fear makes men deliberate; and yet no one deliberates about that which is utterly hopeless. So that, when it shall better serve our cause

<note type="chapter"> 15. </note> that the audience be affected by fear, we must set them off as persons liable to suffer, inasmuch as others of greater power have suffered, and also to show that their equals are or have been exposed to sufferings; and this, at the hands of persons from whom they would not have apprehended it, and such things, and at times when they would not have apprehended it.</p>
<p>But since on the subject of fear, it is plain what it

<note type="margin"> 16. Confidence de. fined. </note> is ; and on the subject of things exciting fear, and also with what dispositions men experience it; from this it will be plain both what confidence is, and on what points men are confident, and with what dispositions ; for both confidence itself is the opposite of fear, and what inspires it is the opposite of what excites fear; so that it is the hope of things conducive to safety, accompanied by an idea that they are near; and of things to be feared, that they either do not exist, or are at a distance.</p>
<p>But these are circumstances inspiring confidence;

" I have often thought, that after a man has taken the resolution to kill himself, it is not courage in him to do any thing, however desperate, because he has nothing to fear. When a man, either from fear, or pride, or conscience, or whatever motive, has resolved to kill himself; when once the resolution is taken, he has nothing to fear. He may then go and take the king of Prussia by the nose at the head of his army. He cannot fear the rack who is resolved to kill himself. When Eustace Budgell was walking down to the Thames, determined to drown himself, he might if he pleased, without any apprehension of danger, have turned aside and first set fire to St. James's palace.”—Boswell’s Johnson, A.

But he will have an esteem for those who admire him, and whom he does himself admire, and by whom he wishes to be admired, and in regard to whom he feels emulation, and whose opinion he does not hold cheap.

On which account men have a sense of shame, even towards those who ask any thing for the first time, as having never yet forfeited their good opinion in any points. And of this description are both those who have lately sought to be our friends, for they have observed our excellent qualities; and hence, the reply of Euripides to the Syracusans is a good one4; and, of our old acquaintances, those who know no ill of us. And men are

<note type="chapter">21. </note> sensible of shame not only about the things themselves which have been mentioned as delicate points, but even about the indications of them; for instance, not only about licentious conduct, but also about all indications of it; not only in doing what is disgraceful, but even in mentioning it5.

In brief, however, people are not at all sensible of shame before those whose opinions, in regard to their justness, they hold cheap; for no one feels shame before children and brutes: nor do men feel it about the same points when before acquaintances, as before strangers; but when before acquaintances they feel it on points really shameful6; but before strangers on matters merely sanctioned by custom.</p>

But it becomes great should it be conferred on one who is in extreme want2, or if the boon be great and difficult of attainment, or at a crisis of a certain description, or if the giver has bestowed it alone, or first, or in a

We should also examine the

<note type="chapter"> 9. </note> cause . But the evils whose characteristic is great anguish and destruction, are as follows: death, assaults, personal injuries, and age, and sickness, and

<note type="chapter"> 10. </note> want of tood. And the evils of which chance is the cause, are, absolute want, or fewness of friends, <stage>(on which account even the being torn from friends and familiars is a circumstance to be pitied,)</stage> ugliness, infirmity, deformity, and the circumstance that some evil befalls one from a source whence it were becoming for some good to have arisen; and the frequent occurrence of a similar thing: and the accession of some good, when one has already passed his sufferings ; as for example, the gifts of the king were sent

<note type="chapter"> 11. </note> down to Diopithes after he was dead11; and the fact either that no good has accrued, or of there being no enjoyment of it when it has arrived. These, then, and the like, are the circumstances on account of which men feel pity.</p>

And they feel it towards their equals, whether in age, in temper, in habits, in rank, or in family; for in all these relations, the evil is seen with greater clearness as possible to befall also one's self. For we must here also assume generally, that whatever people fear in their own case, that they pity as happening in the case of others. But as the disasters

Whence also this was remarked by Homer: " He missed engaging with Ajax the son of

But, if it be not on the same grounds, we feel indignant if an inferior challenge a superior, even on any grounds; for instance, if a musician were to dispute with a just man, for justice is superior to music. The persons then with whom, and the reasons why men feel indignant will be evident from this; for they are these or others of the same description.</p>

<note type="margin"> 12. Men likely to feel indignation. </note> As regards themselves, men have a tendency to indignation, if they deserve and have acquired the highest goods; for the circumstance of those not their equals being thought worthy of equal advan-

And those, in a word, who think themselves worthy those things, of which they do not esteem others worthy, are apt to feel indignant at those others, and about those very objects.

And from this it is evident on what occasions of misfortunes, or ill luck, or failure of success, persons ought to rejoice, or at least to be unaffected by pain; for, from what has been stated, the contraries will be evident. So that should the speech have wrought up the judges into this disposition, and should it have shown that those who claim to be pitied, and that the circumstances under which they claim it, are undeserving pity, and really deserving not to gain it, it will be impossible for the judges to feel pity.

And those who are ambitious are more given to envy than those who are devoid of ambition. And those who make a show of wisdom, for they are ambitious on the score of wisdom.

<p>

<note type="margin">5. Men likely to be envied. </note> Again, it is evident with whom men are envious ; for this has been already stated in connexion [with what has gone before; since men envy those who

<note type="margin"> Rivals. </note> of envy 3." Men also envy those with whom they are at rivalry; for they are rivals of those above- mentioned ; but of those who existed ten thousand years back, or who may live ten thousand years hence, or who are already dead, of these no one is the rival; nor again of those who live at the Pillars of Hercules 4; nor of those of whom, in the opinions either of themselves or of others, they are greatly the inferiors ; nor again of those to whom they conceive themselves to be in a great degree superior; with the like indifference do they regard those fat all en-

<note type="chapter"> 6. </note> gaged] in pursuits of this description. And as men are affected by ambition in regard to rivals, and competitors, and all, in a word, who are eager after the same objects, it must follow that they envy these in an especial manner; whence the saying, " potter

<note type="margin"> 7. The successful, </note>

<note type="margin"> 8. Those whose success is a tacit reproach to us. </note> envies potter." And those who either succeed with difficulty, or do not succeed at all, envy those who succeed quickly. Again, they envy those whose acquisitions and success are a reproach to themselves, and these are those who are near them, or their equals; for it becomes evident that they do themselves fail of success through their own fault, so that

this, galling them, produces envy. And those who

<note type="chapter"> 10. </note> at considerable expense on an object, envy those who have expended little on the same object. But it is

<note type="chapter"> 11. </note> evident both with whom, and on what occasions, and with what dispositions people of this sort feel pleasure ; for they will be delighted, having in the contrary circumstances that very temper, the which being without, they are pained. So that if the

But at the same time they are thus affected reasonably enough ; for many are they who need the aid of men of property. Whence, too, that remark of Simonides addressed to the wife of Hiero respecting the wealthy and the wise ; for when she asked him, " whether it were better to have been born wealthy or wise," he replied, " wealthy; for," he said, " he used to see the wise hanging on at the doors of the wealthy."

For men in power are more ambitious and more manly in their dispositions than the wealthy; from their aiming at all duties whatsoever, which from their power they have the means of discharging. And they are less given to trifling, because, from a necessity of looking carefully to their power, they are constrained to a diligent attention. And they comport themselves with a dignity which is conciliatory rather than repulsive; for their claims for dignity render them more conspicuous ; on which account, they bear themselves moderately : but conciliatory dignity is a softened and graceful sedateness. And, if they do transgress the bounds of right, it is not in small points, but in those which are of importance, that they are guilty.</p>

But he alone is strictly a judge, who decides on the questions at issue in civil<ref n="1"/> controversies : since both forensic questions, and those on which men deliberate, are agitated as to how they stand. But of dispositions, as they are affected by the constitutions of states, we have spoken above. So that the means will now have been distinctly unfolded, both how, and by the use of what things, we may render our addresses ethical.</p>
<p>

<note type="chapter">2. </note> But as there was, in each species of orations, a certain distinct end proposed; and as respecting all of them some ideas and propositions have been ascertained, out of which the deliberative, demonstrative, and judicial orators deduce their means of persuading ; and as, in addition to these, the means by which it is possible for us to render our speeches ethical, have been developed; it merely remains, that we go over

<p>But of these common topics, amplification is most congenial to demonstrative oratory, as has been remarked ; possibility, as relating to the past, to judicial3; since on what has been its decision is made; but possibility, as relating to the future, is most congenial to deliberative.</p>

If the more difficult be possible, so will also that which is easier. And if it be possible for a thing to be produced in a state of excellence or beauty, it also is possible for it to be produced under general circumstances ; for it is more difficult for a building to be

<note type="margin"> 5. The beginning. </note> made beautiful, than simply a building. And in whatever case the commencement is possible, the fulfilment also is possible1: for of things which are impossible, none either take place or begin to do so; for instance, it neither is the case, that the diameter of a square is commensurable with the side, neither

<note type="margin"> 6. The subsequent. </note> every thing proceeds from a beginning. And if the subsequent in being or production be possible, so also is the antecedent: if, for example, it be possible that a man should be produced, so also is it that a child should, since it is antecedent in its production : again, if it be possible for a child, so is it also for a man to be produced; on the principle that the former is a

<note type="margin"> 7. Things which we love. </note> commencement. Things likewise are possible, of which there is a natural love or desire; for no one loves what is impossible, neither desires it, for the

And if a thing admits of

So that as with respect to each class of speeches the proposed end is a good ; <stage>(for instance, the expedient,-the honourable,-and the just;)</stage> it is evident that by every orator, his means of amplification are to be arrived at through the medium of these.

Again1, example is somewhat of this description, as if one were to assert that the state ought to set itself in order against the king, and not to allow him to make himself master of Egypt; and this, because aforetime Darius passed not into Greece, before that he had seized that country; but when he had seized it, he passed across; so that the present king, should he seize Egypt, will pass over; on which account he is not to be permitted.</p>

<note type="margin">4. Illustration. </note> Illustration is of the nature of Socrates's discourses : for instance, were one to say that it is not fitting that magistrates chosen by lot should be in office; for it is just the same thing as though one were to pick out wrestlers by lot; not taking such as are able to contend, but those on whom the lot may fall: or as though men were to draw lots for that person of the crew whom it might befit to take the helm; as if it became the person on whom the lot fell, and not him who understood the art.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">o. Fable. </note> But fable is such as that of Stesichorus in opposition to Phalaris, and that of Aesop in behalf of the demagogue. For Stesichorus, when the citizens of Himera had chosen Phalaris<ref n="2"/> general with absolute powers, and were on the eve of assigning him a body guard, after other things which he said, related to them a fable: " That a horse was sole master of a meadow; but that on a stages coming in and spoiling the pasture, in his wish to be avenged of the stag, he asked some man whether he should be able, in

<note type="footnote" n="2"> Bentley seems to suspect this story as applying to Phalaris, " because," says he, " Conon, a writer in Julius Caesar's time, gives us the very same narrative; but, instead of Phalaris, he says it was Gelon that Stesichorus spoke of.

conjunction with him, to chastise the stag. The man said [that he would be able] if he would take the bit, and himself were to mount him with his darts. When, however, he had agreed to this, and the man was mounted, the horse, instead of being revenged, was himself already the slave of the man. And in the same way do you also <stage>(says he)</stage> look to it, lest, in your wish to avenge yourselves on your enemies, you suffer in the same way as the horse ; for already, through your choice of a commander with independent power, you have the bit in your mouths: but if you assign him a body guard, and permit him to mount into the saddle, you will become, from that moment forth, the slaves of Phalaris."</p>
<p>And Aesop, when pleading at Samoa in behalf of

<note type="margin"> 6. </note> a demagogue who was tried for his life, said, " That a fox in crossing a river was thrust out of her course into a drain, and that, being unable to get out, she was harassed for a long time, many horse leeches having got hold of her; but a hedgehog wandering by, when he saw her, taking compassion on her, asked whether he should pick off the horse leeches from her; that the fox however would not permit him; but on his asking why, she replied, ‘ Because these are indeed already filled from me, and now suck but a little blood; if, however, you should pick them off, others, who are hungry, coming up will drain off the little blood which remains.

Because, if they be put first, they bear resemblance to induction; and induction, except in few instances, is not proper to rhetoric; whereas when put in at the end, they resemble evidence; and a witness in every case influences belief.

<p>ON the subject of the use of maxims, after it has

been stated what a maxim is, it will most easily become clear both in what cases, on what occasions, and what persons it befits to avail themselves of the enunciation of maxims in their speeches.</p>

So that, as the enthymem is a form of reasoning

<note type="margin">Conclusions of most enthymems are maxims. </note> nearly [confined] to this description of subjects, both the conclusions of enthymems and their premises, after the syllogistic form has been done away, become maxims 2. Take an instance: “ A man who is

<note type="footnote" n="1"> Having told you that maxims are certain general propositions, he cautions you against supposing that every general proposition deserves this appellation. For example, mathematical truths are asserted in propositions, general enough it is true, which however do not come up to the notion which Aristotle would have you form of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμη</foreign>. I hardly know whether it be allowable to attempt an explanation of Aristotle from a popular comedy ; but those readers who remember the School for Scandal, may probably derive some illustration of this subject from the ' sentiments' there put in the mouth of Joseph Surface ; e. g. " The heart that is conscious of its own integrity, is ever slow to credit another's treachery." Act iv. scene 3. </note>

<note type="footnote" n="2"> In other words, the maxim is to the enthymem what propositions are to syllogisms. Not to every enthymem does the
<foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμη</foreign> hold this relation, but to such only as are conversant
with " the actions and passions of common life." Aristotle has not ventured to tell us that all enthymems relate to these subjects; he says only that " nearly" all of them are so conversant ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τοιούτων ἐστὶ σχεδόν</foreign>. </note>

in his sound mind never ought to educate his children so as to be too highly skilled 3." Now this is a maxim: but if the reason, and the cause why he should not do so, be added, the whole [conjointly] will become an enthymem; thus, " for besides the indolence which they contract, they will attach to themselves the bitter jealousy of the citizens." Again, this : " There is not a man who in every respect is happy4:" and the following: "There is not one of all mankind who is free5," are maxims: and the last becomes an enthymem, if added to the following proposition, " for either he is the slave of money or of fortune."</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">3. Maxims are of four kinds. </note> If, then, the maxim be what it has been described, there will necessarily be four kinds of maxims: for either they will be with the annexed reason, or with-

Now the maxims which need proof are all such as assert any thing which contravenes received opinion, or is doubtful; but those which state nothing contrary to peopled notions do well enough] with-

<note type="chapter"> 5. </note> out the addition of proot. And of these last it cannot but be that some will need no proofs, from their having been previously known ; as, " The best thing for a man, as it seems to me at least, is health -because to nine-tenths of mankind this seems to be the case: and that others simultaneously with their being uttered become evident to such as turn their attention to them ; as, " There is no lover who does not always

And again, of those which have proof subjoined, some are a part of an enthymem, just as, " A man who is in his sound mind never ought," etc. Others are essentially enthymems, and not part of an enthymem ; the which obtain more than any other species. And these are all those in which the reason for what is asserted appears wrought in, as

in this maxim: " Being yourself a mortal, do not

<note type="margin"> These last are most approved. </note> cherish immortal wrath :” "-or the assertion that, " one ought not always to cherish wrath," is a maxim; that, however, which is added, viz. "because you are a mortal," states the reason why. Similar to which is the following: “ It is fitting that a mortal conceive mortal notions, not that a being destined to death should think of what is immortal 7."</p>

For on subjects which may be questioned, or contravene received opinions, the orator must not use those without the reason annexed; but let him either, prefixing the reason, use the conclusion as a maxim, thus—“ For my part, as then it neither is good to be exposed to envy, nor to be indolent, I assert that it is not good to be educated ;" or, stating this [which here is the conclusion] first, subjoin that which was prefixed 8. Observing that on subjects which do not contravene received opinions, but are doubtful, that he annex the reason why as concisely as possible. And on subjects such as these the

Since for one not so advanced in age to sport maxims is bad taste, just as it is for him to have recourse to fables: and the use of them on subjects about which one is ignorant is silly, and argues a want of education. There is a sufficient sign of the truth of this; for the boors of the country are of all other people most fond of hammering out maxims,

<note type="margin"> 11. Common ones are useful. </note> Again, it is proper to avail ones self of maxims which are current and common, if they be of any service ; for from their being common they appear to be correct, as though every one acknowledged their truth11: this one, for instance, <stage>(if the orator be exhorting persons to face the hazard, though they have not sacrificed,)</stage> " One omen there is which is best, to defend one's country or to face it, though they be few in number,-" Mars is common;" and to cut off the children of their foes, what though they have done no injury,-" He is a fool who, after slaying the father, still spares the child12."</p>

sioned manner. The speaking in an impassioned manner is, as if one in a passion were to assert, " that it was a falsehood that one ought to know himself; at least, this man, had he known himself, would never have claimed to be your general 13." The moral character appears better [when we contradict a maxim] thus, "it does not become men, as some assert, to love as though they were about to hate, but to hate as though they were about to love." And we ought

<note type="chapter"> If. </note> to give a mamfestation of our moral principle by means of the diction we employ, otherwise to subjoin the reason; for instance, either stating the sentence thus, " we ought to love, not as they tell us, but as though always about to love, for the other is the part of an insidious manor thus, “ the common maxim does not please me; for it is the duty of the true friend at least to love as though he were always about to love." " Nor again [does this please me], that we ought to carry nothing to excess; since 'tis our duty to hate the wicked at least to the very extreme."</p>
<p>They contribute, too, a considerable aid to our

<note type="margin"> 15. Maxims aid a speech. i.

My meaning, however, will be plain in this way, as also the manner in which we ought to catch at them; for the maxim, as has been stated, is an assertion universally, and men feel delighted when that is asserted universally, which they happen previously to have taken up as their opinion upon particulars. If, for instance, a man chanced to have bad neighbours or children, he would hail the man who should say, "nothing is more annoying than dwelling near people," or, " nothing is more silly than to beget children."

<note type="footnote" n="13">The words probably of some panegyrist of Iphicrates, who, in the warmth of declamation, must have produced a very great effect by contradicting a maxim so generally received, and which bore an authority more than human, (e ccelo descendit <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνω̃θι σεαυτὸν</foreign>,) while at the same time he placed the merit of the general in a most striking light.

This one advantage the application of maxims must needs possess, and another superior to it; for it gives our orations an air of character. But those orations bear an impress of character in which the principle is manifest. And all maxims produce this effect by reason of the speaker's asserting universally on things which are the objects of deliberate choice: so that should the maxims be good, they make the speaker also to appear a man of worthy character.</p>

<note type="chapter"> 8. </note> view of existing circumstances7: there is no difference in your pursuing this process, whether it be respecting Athenians or Lacedaemonians, men or gods. For in advising Achilles, or in praising or blaming him, in accusing and defending him, we must assume the traits which attach, or appear to attach, to his character; in order that from among their number we may, in so praising or blaming him, allege whatever things honourable or base attach to him; and in accusing or defending him, whatever things just or unjust; and in advising him, whatever is beneficial

session of certain select propositions on points which may occur, and are most convenient: and [it is

The orator must seize the peculiar points. </note> evident] that the orator should conduct his inquiry respecting questions which arise on the sudden in the same manner, not turning his view aside to indefinite points, but to the actual points of the case which the oration is concerning; and embracing in his sketch the greatest number he is able, and those coming the nearest to the point; for in proportion as he is master of the greater number of the things inherent in the case, by so much the easier will it be to effect proof; and in proportion as these are the nearer to the point, in the very same proportion will they be more peculiar, and less vague. By vague I mean, the praising

<note type="chapter"> 12. </note> Achilles because he is a man, and one of the deified heroes, and made war against Troy ; for these are points attaching to a thousand others beside: so that such an orator no more praises Achilles than he does Diomed. But by peculiar I mean, those which befall no one else than to Achilles, for instance, the slaying Hector, the bravest of the Trojans ; and Cycnus, who, being himself invulnerable, prevented all the forces from landing ; and that he joined the expedition the youngest, and without being bound by an oath; and whatever other topics are of this description. One element of enthymems, then, is that

<note type="margin"> The topic of selection. </note> of selection ; and this is the first which partakes of the nature of topics.</p>
<p>And now let us state the elements of enthymems;

<note type="chapter"> 13. </note> <stage>(but by pace and element of an enthymem I mean the same thing)</stage>. First, however, let us treat of those

<note type="margin"> 14. Two sorts of enthymems:
<foreign xml:lang="grc">δεικτικὰ.
ἐλεκτικὰ</foreign>. </note> points concerning which it is necessary first to speak. For of enthymems there are two species; the one species are confirmative, that such is or is not the fact; and the other refutative: and they differ just as, in logic, the syllogism and the elenchus differ. And the confirmative enthymem is the deducing a

<note type="chapter"> 15. </note> conclusion from acknowledged premises; the refuta-

<note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note>
tive, however, is the deducing an inference which is

<note type="chapter"> 16. </note> not admitted. Now the general arguments nearly on each class of subjects necessary and useful to be known are in our possession; for propositions have been selected on each [branch of rhetoric] ; so that the topics out of which one must allege his enthymems, whether on questions of good or evil, just or unjust, honourable or dishonourable, select points moreover respecting the dispositions, the passions, and the habits, having been collected above, are likewise actually before us.</p>

When these points have been elucidated, we shall discuss the subject of starting objections to enthymems, and the means of their solution, from what sources we ought to adduce them.</p>

<title type="sub">Elements of Enthymems.</title>
</ab>
<p>

<note type="margin">1. i. Element,that of contraries. </note> THERE is one element of confirmative enthymems, derivable from contraries; for we should consider, whether the contrary quality be inherent in the contrary subject; doing away the argument [grounded thereon] if it be not inherent; and if it be inherent, founding one thereon ourselves: for example, the argument that " Temperance is good, because intemperance is injurious:" or, as it is in the Messeniac<ref n="1"/> oration, "If war be the cause of our present trou-

bles, of course we shall put ourselves right again with the return of peace." And, " If in truth it be not just to be angry with those who unwillingly do us harm; neither, if one on compulsion shall do good to any one, is it his duty to be grateful to him." And, " If to speak falsely is among men available to persuade; there is no anomaly in supposing, on the contrary, that many things which are true fail of being believed."</p>
<p>Another is derivable from conjugate inflections2;

<note type="margin"> 2. ii. Of conjugate inflections. </note> for the qualities must either be inherent consistently, or not at all; for example, the argument, that " the just is not in every case a good, for then also would that which is justly be well; now it is not, however, desirable to die justly3.</p>
<p>Another from relatives; for if to one party attach

<note type="margin"> 3. iii. From relatives. </note> the idea of his having acted honourably or justly, to the other also will attach that of having suffered [honourably, etc.]. Also, if to command be just, so also is the having executed [the command] ; for example, just as that farmer of the revenue, Diomedon 4, said of the revenues, " If it be not base for you to put them up for sale, neither is it for us to purchase them." And if the idea that he has suffered justly or honourably be on the side of the patient, so will it also be on that of the agent; and if on that of the agent, then also on that of the patient. There is, however, in this way of arguing, room for passing off some false reasoning 5: for if the person has justly suffered any thing, he indeed has justly been a sufferer, but perhaps not so at your hands. On which

account we should view the question separately,­ whether the patient deserve to suffer, and whether the agent have a right to inflict the suffering; that done, to employ the facts in whatever way may suit our purpose: for at times, considerations of this kind do not harmonize; just as in the Alcmaeon of Theodectus, " Did no man hate thy mother ?" In his reply he tells her, that it is fitting to consider the points taken separately ; and when Alphesiboea asks how, taking her up, he says, " That she indeed deserved death, they did decree; but at the same time that I ought not to be the slayer." And just so the trial respecting Demosthenes, and of the persons who slew Nicanor. For when they had been adjudged to have slain him justly, it appeared that he had also been justly put to death. Again, respecting the person who met his death at Thebes, respecting whom some one bade the question be decided, whether he were deserving death; as though it were not unjust to slay one who deserved to die.</p>

<note type="margin">4. iv. From comparisoil in three ways. i.a fortiori. </note> Another element is derivable from the relations of greater and less6; for instance: " If not even the gods know every thing, hardly I should suppose do men for it is-to say, that if the quality be not inherent in that which would more naturally possess it; then it is evident, that in that which would less naturally possess it, it is not inherent.</p>

Paris and this, ‟ Suppose Hector did slay Patroclus, Paris slew Achilles;" and this, " If other artists are not to be held cheap, neither are philosophers and, "If generals are not held cheap because they are frequently vanquished, neither are sophists;" and that, " If it behoves an individual to have a care for your glory, it also behoves you to regard that of Greece."</p>
<p>Another element arises from the consideration of

<note type="margin"> 6. v. From respect of time. </note> time, as Iphicrates urged in his oration against Harmodius, " that if before my doing it, I had claimed to have the honour of a statue, ye would have granted it; will ye not then grant it me now that I have achieved it ?-Do not, therefore, engage yourselves under promises, when about to receive; and, when you have experienced the benefit, withdraw them." And, on another occasion, in reference to the Thebans permitting Philip to pass through into Attica, the argument that, " if, before his aiding them against the Phocians, he had claimed a passage, they would have promised; it were then an absurd thing, if, because he threw himself on them, and had confidence in them, they should not let him march through8."</p>
<p>Another element is deduced from assertions made

You ought, however, to be dealing with an opposite party, who appears in a greater degree to have been guilty of injustice; otherwise it would appear ridiculous, were any one laying an accusation against an Aristides, to allege this ; but it ought always to tend directly to the discredit of him who lays the impeachment ; for, generally speaking, the plaintiff presumes himself better than the defendant; this notion, then, it behoves us to refute. And generally it is absurd when one chides in another what he does himself, or would feel inclined to do ; or exhorts him to do what he does not himself, neither would be induced to do.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">8. vii. From definition. </note> Another place is from definitions9; as, " that the genius is nothing else than either the deity, or his production. And yet whoever conceives the existence of the production of a deity, must necessarily think at the same time that gods are in existence 10." And, as Iphicrates said, "that that man was most noble who was the best; for that there did not attach any nobility to Harmodius and Aristogiton before they had achieved some noble exploit." And his proof that himself was more nearly akin to them, by saying, " At any rate my deeds are more akin to those of Harmodius and Aristogiton, than yours are11."

" All will be free to acknowledge that the intemperate do not acquiesce in the enjoyment of a single person." And the reason on account of which Socrates refused to go to Archelaus, " because," said he, " it is a disgrace for one who has been treated well to be unable to make a retort on terms of equality, just as it would be for one who has been treated ill." For all these deduce their inferences about the points respecting which they speak, after having defined and ascertained the question.</p>
<p>Another element is deducible from the number of

<note type="margin"> 9. viii. From the number of meanings of the term. 10. ix. From the division. </note> senses in which a word may be taken, as in the Topics respecting the acceptations of the word rightly. Another from taking the different bearings of the case; as, " If all act unjustly for three objects, for the sake either of this, or this, or this, and from two of these motives it is impossible that he should have acted; but that he acted on the third, not even the accusers themselves allege."</p>
<p>Another from induction, as may be illustrated from

<note type="margin"> 11. x. From induotion. </note> the oration respecting Peparethus, to establish that women every where discern truly respecting their children; because first at Athens the mother made the matter clear to Mantias, the orator, when undertaking a suit against his son; and again at Thebes, when Ismenias and Stilbon were at issue on the point, the Dodonian woman proved the child to be the son of Ismenias; and on this account they considered Thessaliscus to be the son of Ismenias. And again, from the law of Theodectes, " If people do not give their own horses in charge to those who manage those of others amiss, nor [their ships] to those who overturn the ships of others; neither ought we, if in every case it happens in the same way, to employ those who but ill protect the safety of others, for our own protection." And, as Alcidamas asserted, that " all pay honour to the wise, at least the Parians. honoured Archilochus, what though he was a calumniator of them; and the Chians, Homer, who was not their citizen; the Mitylenaeans, Sappho, though she was a woman; and the Lacedaemonians, who of

<p>

<note type="margin">12. xi. From former decisions. </note> Another element of enthymems is derivable from a former decision of the same, a similar, or opposite question; more especially indeed if all men so decide, and that uniformly ; and otherwise, [if not all,] but the majority ; or the wise, either all, or most of them ; or the good; or if the very judges themselves, or those whom they approve, or those in opposition to whom they cannot decide <stage>(as for instance those on whom they depend)</stage> ; or those contrary to whom it is not becoming to decide; for instance, a god, or a father, or teacher, [happen so to have decided]. Just on the principle of the appeal of Autocles to Mixidemides, " whether it beseemed the awful goddesses to render an account to the Areopagus, and not Mixidemides ?" Or, as Sappho insisted, "that to die was an evil, the gods having so decided; since [had it not been so] they would themselves have died;" or as Aristippus told Plato when he asserted something, as he thought, rather dogmatically, " Yet," said he, " our companion at least held no such thing," meaning Socrates. And Hegesippus, having first consulted the oracle at Olympia, put the question secondly at Delphi,-whether he [Apollo] was of the same opinion as his father; as though it were disgraceful to contradict a father. And of Helen, as Isocrates wrote12, that " she was worthy, since indeed Theseus judged her so." And of Paris, " whom the goddesses

preferred 13;" and of Evagoras, as lacerates says, that must needs be virtuous, It since Conon, when unfortunately passing by every one else, came to Evagoras."</p>
<p>Another element arises from an enumeration of

<note type="margin"> 13. xii. From the enumeration of parts. </note> parts; as in the Topica, " what kind of motion the soul is; it is either of this, or that description." And an instance occurs in the Socrates of Theodectes: "Toward what temple bath he been guilty of impiety? whom of the gods which the ritual of our state acknowledges, hath he not honoured ? "</p>
<p>Another consists in, Since, in the generality of in-

<note type="margin"> 14. xiii. From the consequents. </note> stances, it happens that on the same circumstances somewhat is consequent whether good or evil, the exhortation or dissuasion by means of these consequences, the accusation or defence, the praising or blaming; for instance, on education is consequent envy, which is an evil; and the being wise, which is a good: [on the one hand then you may assert that] men should not seek to be educated, because it is not good to be envied; [on the other that] it is fitting to be educated, for it is good to be wise. In this topic 14, with the addition of that on possibility, and the other [universal means of proof], as they have been stated, consists the system of CaliDDus.</p>
<p>Another occurs, when we want to exhort or: dis-

<note type="margin"> 15. xiv. From the dilemma. </note> suade respecting two propositions, and those opposed to each other; and to avail ourselves of the forementioned argument in the case of both. The difference [between this and the element last mentioned] is, that in it the opposition is merely between any propositions which may happen, it here holds between contraries : for instance, a priestess was endeavouring to prevent her son from becoming a public speaker ;

<note type="footnote" n="13">See book i. chap. vi. § 26; where, in stating that to be good which is an object of preference, he cites these two instances. </note>

<note type="footnote" n="14">It is, however, a mode of argument sometimes so falla. cious, that we may say with Ovid, careat successibus opto Quisquis ab eventu facta notanda putat. </note>

<note type="footnote"> Phyllis Demoph. </note>
<pb n="186"/>

<note type="margin"> [ BOOK II. </note>
because, said she, " If on the one hand you speak what is just, men will hate you ; if what is unjust, the gods." [Here then it might be retorted], therefore you ought to become a public speaker; for, " if you speak what is just, the gods will love you; if what is unjust, men 15." And this is equivalent to the proverb " of buying dirt as well as salt." And the retortion is this, when on each of two contraries good and evil is consequent, they being respectively opposed.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">16. xv. From the different motives of mankind. </note> Another arises from the circumstance, that men do not approve the same things privately as before the world; but when in public, they praise beyond all things what is just and honourable ; but within themselves they prefer what is expedient: the orator should endeavour to infer whichever suits his purpose, for this element is of sovereign use in exposing anomalies of opinion.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">17. xvi. From analogy. </note> Another element is deducible from the analogy of results; as Iphicrates urged when they compelled his son to serve who was under the standard age, because he was tall, that " if they esteem great children as men, they assuredly will vote small men to be children." And Theodectes, in the oration respecting the law, asked, "Do ye make the mercenaries, such as Strabax and Charidemus, citizens on account of their virtue, and will ye not make exiles of those among the mercenaries who have committed these intolerable acts?"</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">18. xvii.From the similarity of consequents. </note> Another arises out of the argument, that if the result be the same, the principle from which it arises will be the same; just as Xenophanes used to argue, that " they are equally guilty of impiety who assert that the gods were produced, as those who assert that they die; for in both cases it happens that in some period or other the gods do not exist." And generally

<note type="footnote" n="15">See an instance of this mode of arguing used by Tiresias, Euripides, Phoenissae, 968. Of this kind is also the argument of Gamaliel: " If this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought; but, if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it." Acts v. 38, 39. </note>
<pb n="187"/>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XXIII.] </note>
assuming that the result of each act is in every case identified with it. [Take this argument as an illustration] : "Ye are about to pronounce, not respecting Socrates, but respecting the pursuit in general, whether it be right to addict one's self to philosophy." And this, "that the giving earth and water is the being slaves." And "that the participating in the common peace is the performing of what is enjoined." Now we are to take whichever side may suit our purpose.</p>
<p>Another may be deduced from the circumstance,

<note type="margin"> 19. xviii. From the inconsistency of men. </note> that the same persons do not choose the same things subsequently as before, but contrariwise; as, for instance, this appeal :-" If, when in banishment, we fought that we might return ; shall we, now that we have returned, take to flight, in order that we may not fight16?" For one while they chose abiding in their country at the expense of fighting ; at another, the possibility of avoiding fighting at the expense of non-continuance in their native land.</p>
<p>Another element which may be resorted to is, the

<note type="margin"> 20. xix. From assuming a possible end as the real one. </note> assertion that a thing either exists or was produced, for the sake of that for which it might have existed or been produced; as if some one were to give a person any thing, in order that by taking it from him he may annoy him. Whence also it has been said, " To many, fortune, not bearing them good will, gives great good luck; but it is in order that they may receive the more conspicuous calamities 17." And this from the Meleager of Antiphon: " Not in order that they might slay the beast, but that they may become witnesses, before Greece, of Meleager's valour." And that insinuation in the Ajax of Theodectes, "that Diomede chose Ulysses, not as any compliment, but in order that his attendant might at the same time be his inferior." For it is very possible that he did so on this account.</p>
<p>Another, common both to the judicial and de-

<note type="margin"> 21. xx. From consider-</note> liberative orators, is the consideration of the motives

<note type="footnote" n="16">From an Oration by Lysias. </note>

<note type="footnote" n="17">Evertêre domes totas optantibus ipsis Dii faciles. </note>
<pb n="188"/>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note>

<note type="margin"> ing the
motives. </note> which stimulate or retard men, and the objects with a view to which they both act and avoid; for these are such as, if they be actually in existence, we needs must proceed to action; for instance, if the undertaking be possible, and easy, and beneficial, either to the person in question himself, or to his friends, or pernicious to his enemies, and entailing loss on them ; or if the loss be less than the object proposed 18. And it is upon these considerations that orators exhort, and on their opposites that they dissuade ; moreover they both defend and accuse upon the ground of these considerations; they rest their defences on those which are used to dissuade, and their accusations on those used to exhort 19. The whole system of Calippus, as well as that of Pamphilus, is nothing more than this element.</p>
<p>

<note type="footnote" n="2">2. xxi. From that which is incredible yet true. </note> Another is deducible from circumstances which appear to have taken place, but which are improbable, on the ground that they would not seem to be facts, had they not well nigh occurred or actually done so; and that they have a yet stronger claim to belief; for men apprehend as truths either facts or probabilities; if then it be passing belief, and not probable, it will be true 20; for at all events, it is not on account of its likelihood and plausibility that it has this appearance of being the case. Just as Androcles of the burgh Pithos, said in his impeachment

<note type="footnote" n="18"><foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρα̃γμα</foreign> : by this word he designates the object of desire and pursuit. Victor. </note>

<note type="footnote" n="19">That is to say, those very same faculties which the deliberative orator would employ in exhorting a person to act, would, if existing in reference to one under accusation, be turned against him by the judicial speaker as circumstances confirmative of suspicion. And, vice versâ, the circumstances of difficulty attending the undertaking, which would be employed to dissuade from its attempt, might be alleged in defence of an individual under suspicion, as points of the case which render his guilt improbable. </note>

<note type="footnote" n="20">The argument may be formally stated thus : Men believe either what is actual fact, or probable; this is believed; this therefore is either fact, or probable; it is not probable, therefore it is fact. It is needless to observe that the slight possibility, that it may be neither one nor the other, is completely slurred over. </note>

of the law, when the multitude were tumultuous as he spoke, " The laws require some law to set them right, for the very fishes require salt;" and yet it is neither likely nor plausible that creatures bred in the brine of the sea should require salt. " Nay, the olive lees require oil," and yet it is a fact not to be credited, that the very things from which oil is produced should require oil."</p>
<p>Another element, REFUTATIVE, is the consideration

<note type="margin"> 23. Refutative element. i. From consideration of contradictions. </note> of contradictions; if there occur any contradiction under all the circumstances of time, conduct 21, sayings, and the like. And this independently, respecting your adversary, as " He tells you that he loves you, yet did he conspire with the thirty [tyrants] ;" or independently respecting yourself, " He tells you that I am litigious, but is not able to prove that I have brought any action into court;" or respecting both yourself and the adversary distinctly, " This man never lent any thing, but I have ransomed manv of vou."</p>
<p> Another, applicable to those who have been calum-

<note type="margin"> 24. ii. From explanation. </note> mated, or who appear so, whether men or actions, is the explaining the cause of the mistaken notion; for there is some circumstance, on account of which it appears to be the case; for example, when a certain woman had come in contact with her son, she seemed from her embracing him to have had connexion with the youth; when, however, the circumstance which caused it had been stated, the charge was quashed. And as in the Ajax of Theodectes, Ulysses tells Ajax why, though he is braver than Ajax, he does not seem so.</p>
<p>Another is derived from the cause, if that be in

<note type="margin"> 25. iii. By arguing from </note> existence, arguing that the effect is also; and should it not exist, that neither does the effect. For cause,

Just as Leodamas in his defence, when Thrasybulus accused him, because he had been inscribed with infamy on a pillar in the Acropolis, but erased it in the time of the thirty tyrants, urged, " that it was not possible, because the thirty tyrants would put greater confidence in him, while his hatred toward the democracy remained inscribed in public."</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">26. iv. From observing whether the fact could have been done better. </note> Another is, the observing whether the thing respecting which the party is deliberating, or acting, or has acted, did or does admit of being on another and better footing; since it will become evident that, if this be the case, he has not acted; since no one voluntarily, and of his own knowledge, deliberately chooses what is bad. This, however, involves a fallacy ; for in many cases it becomes clear [only] when too late, how it might have been managed better, whereas it was. before unknown.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">27. v. From the anomaly of the present act to the past. </note> Another, which occurs when any thing anomalous to former acts is about to be done, is the considering the both in connexion; just as Xenophanes advised the people of Elea, when they asked him whether they should sacrifice and sing a dirge to Leucothea22 or not, " if they conceived her to be a deity, not to sing a dirge; but if a human being, not to sacrifice."</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">28. vi. From errors before committed.
</note>Another element is, the accusing or defending on the ground of errors committed; for instance, in the
Medea of Carcinus, some persons accuse her because she slew her children, [alleging] that at all events they were not forthcoming ; for, respecting the sending away her children, Medea was in fault: she, however, defends herself [alleging that, if any one], she would have murdered Jason, not her children; which in truth had she done, she would have erred in not doing the other. And this element and species of enthymem constitutes the whole of that system of Theodorus, which is first.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">29. vii. From </note> Another is deducible from the name; as Sophocles

says, " Steel in truth you are, and bear the name."

<note type="margin"> the equivocation of the term. </note> And as they are wont to say in their praises of the gods23; and as Conon used to call Thrasybulus, " rash in counsel," <stage>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">θρασύβουλος</foreign>)</stage> ; and Herodicus told Thrasymachus, " You are always rash in fight, <stage>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">θρασύμαχος</foreign>)</stage> ; and Polus, "You always are a colt," <stage>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">Πω̃λος</foreign>)</stage> ; and Draco the legislator, that " his laws were not those of a man, but of a dragon24; for they were harsh." And as the Hecuba of Euripides says of Venus, " The very name of the goddess rightly begins with folly25." And as Charemon says, "Pentheus, rightly named from the calamities20 awaiting him."</p>
<p>Refutative enthymems, however, are more in re-

Of all forms of reasoning, however, as well confirmative as refutative, those produce the greatest effect 27, which are of such a description that, on the commencement of their enunciation, men anticipate the conclusion, yet without their being superficial; for the hearers on their own parts, feel a pleasure 28, in having of themselves anti-

<p>

<note type="margin">1. Fallacious enthymems. </note> JUST as it is possible that [one form of reasoning] may be a syllogism, and that another, without really being such, may appear to be so ; even so it must needs be with respect to the enthymem also, that one description should really be enthymems, and another not, however they may appear to be; for the enthymem is a species of syllogism.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">2. 1st. From the diction of two kinds. i. Asserting a conclusion not inferred. </note> But the elements of these apparent enthymems are, one derivable from the diction: and of this, the first kind is, as in logic, the asserting your last proposition with all the air of a conclusion, although you have deduced no [legitimate] inference at all: thus, " So and so is assuredly not the case, necessarily, therefore, so and so is." And the expressing yourself in the course of your reasonings concisely and pointedly; for this kind of style is the very province of the enthymem, and this kind of fallacy is, it is probable, that which is [demonstrated] " the result of the style of the diction ;" but the stringing together the heads of many syllogisms, is a good expedient with a view to expressing yourself with all the air of syllogism in your style; thus, " that he preserved some, avenged others, emancipated the Greek people." For each of these propositions has been demonstrated from others ; and when they are put in conjunction, it appears that

" the mouse is an excellent animal, being that from which the most esteemed of all rites have derived their name;" for of all rites, the mysteries are held in most esteem. Or, if any one in praising a dog, were to embrace in his panegyric the dog in the heavens, or Pan; because Pindar thus addresses him, "<ref n="0"/> blessed being, whom the inhabitants of Olympus call the all-various dog of the mighty goddess." Or the arguing, that "it is a most disgraceful thing, that there should be not even a dog in the house; and therefore it is evident that a dog is honourable." And the assertion, that Mercury is "communicative" above all the gods, because Mercury alone is called " common." And the stating that <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>, speech, is most excellent; because the good are worthy of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>, esteem, not of wealth: for the words <stage>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγου ἄξιον</foreign>)</stage> are not used in a single sense.</p>
<p>Another [element of fallacy] is the asserting con-

<note type="margin"> 3. 2nd.From division and composition. </note> jointly what is true separately; or separately, what is true conjointly; for as it appears to be the same thing, what though in many instances it be not the same, the orator should practise whatever method is more available to his purpose. The saying of Euthydemus is neither more nor less than an instance of this; the declaration, for instance, that "he knew there was a galley in the Piraeus 1," for he knew each [separate fact of his assertion]. And to declare of one who knows the constituent letters, " that he knows the verse 2;" for the verse is the same thing. Again, the saying that " as twice so much is prejudicial, he denied that the one was wholesome; for it is absurd that two good things should constitute one that is noxious." Thus enunciated, it is adapted to refutation; but thus it is confirmative; "for two evils do not constitute one good," etc. But the whole topic

<note type="footnote"> I An instance of the flagrant absurdity which may arise from taking conjointly what is true only separately: Euthydemus knew there were galleys in existence, and he was in the Piraeus when he had this knowledge; he knew therefore that there were galleys in the Piraeus, i. e. he being in the Piraeus. </note>

is replete wih fallacy. Such again is the saying of Polycrates respecting Thrasybulus, that he had deposed thirty tyrants3;" for he takes them conjointly. Or, as in the Orestes of Theodectes, from distinct cases, "It is just that she who has slain her husband should die; as also that a son at least should avenge his father. Now, are not these the very things that have been done ?" for, taking the cases conjointly, perhaps it is no longer just. This may also come under the fallacy of omission, for it is not explained " by whom [she should be put to death]."</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">4. 3rd. From exaggeration. </note> Another element is the doing away or establishing a point by exaggeration4: and this occurs when, without having shown that [the prisoner] has really committed the crime, [the accuser] proceeds to exaggerate it; for this fallacy causes it to appear <stage>(when the accused employs the exaggeration)</stage> that he has not done the deed; or, <stage>(supposing it be the accuser who gets into a passion,)</stage> that he has done it. Thus then there is no enthymem ; for the hearer is sophistically brought over to a belief either that [the accused] has or has not done it, without any proof having been adduced.</p>

<note type="margin">5. 4th. From a <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημει̃ον</foreign>. </note> Another is the argument drawn from a sign5, for this also is illogical; as if one were to say, " Lovers are an advantage to states; for the love of Harmodius and Aristogiton deposed the tyrant Hipparchus." And if one were to say, " Dionysius is a robber, for he is a wicked man;" for this also is illogical, because not every wicked man is a thief, although every thief is a wicked man.

<note type="footnote" n="3"> The fallacy consists in this, that it leads you to suppose that Thrasybulus had destroyed thirty distinct tyrannies, whereas he had in fact only suppressed one, the power of which happened to be shared between thirty different individuals. </note>

<note type="margin">CHAP. XXIV.] </note> Another is the arguing from an accidental cir-

<note type="margin">6. 6th. From the accidents of a thing. </note> cumstance; exemplified in that which Polycrates<ref n="6"/> said about mice, that " they lent their aid by gnawing through the [enemy's] bowstrings." Or supposing one to declare, "that the being bidden to supper is the most honourable; for Achilles was wroth, on account of his not being invited by the Greeks at Tenedos:" he however was enraged, as though he was treated with disrespect, and this occurred upon his not being invited.</p>
<p>Another arises from establishing the consequent;

<note type="margin"> 7. 6th. From asserting that as a logical property which is not. </note> as in the oration respecting Paris, [it is contended] that " he is of a noble spirit; because, despising the society of many, he abode on Ida by himself for, because the noble-spirited are thus disposed, he, too, it should seem, is noble-spirited. Again, " Since he is both foppish in his dress, and strolls about by night, he is an adulterer;" because adulterers are persons of such habits7. Similar to this is also the argument, that the poor, because they dance and sing in the temples ; and that exiles, because it is permitted them to dwell where they list, [are happy.]" For as these advantages belong to those who appear to be happy; they too would appear to be happy, to whom they belong. Moreover, the case varies with the circumstances of the transaction; on which account, the argument falls under the charge of omission.</p>
<p>Another arises from stating as a cause that which

<note type="margin">8. 7th. From asserting that as a cause which is not a cause. </note> in fact is not; [arguing], for instance, on its having happened "simultaneously," or "after;" for men do assume that what occurs "subsequently," [occurs] " by means of" [that which preceded], and more especially those engaged in state affairs; just as Demades [insinuated] "that the administration of

Or if any one were to say, " that the striking free men was an insult because under all circumstances this is not the case, but when one begins the violence.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">10. 9th. From arguing. </note> Again, as in the disputations of the Sophists, there arises an apparent syllogism from stating things absolutely or not absolutely, but conditionally ; as [it is contended] in logic, that " what is a nonentity, does exist; because a nonentity exists as a nonentity;" and that " what is unknown is known, for it is known to be unknown9;" just so in rhetoric also, we have an apparent enthymem from what is not absolutely probable, but conditionally probable. This, however, is not universally the case; as in truth Agatho remarks, " Perhaps some one will be inclined to assert this to be probable, that many improbabilities will befall men:" for that which is contrary to probability does occur; so that even what is contrary to probability is probable 10; this, however, is not the case absolutely; but just as in sophistical disputations, it is the omission of the circumstances of extent, relation, and place, which produces the imposition; so also here [in rhetoric], it results from the things being probable not absolutely, but conditionally pro-

And so also respecting all other cases, for he needs must be either open to the imputation or not. Both cases then appear to be likely; but the one is likely [ablolutely], the other not absolutely, but so as has been explained. And this is [the secret] "of making the worse, the better side 12." And hence mankind were justly in-

On the subject of the means of persuasion much has been said, as well as to how many the sources are out of which [they arise], namely, that they are three; also, what is the nature of these sources, and why they are no more: for all those who decide, are persuaded either by being themselves impressed in a certain way, or from conceiving the speakers to be men of a certain character, or from the matter of fact having been proved1.</p>
<p>It has been stated also with respect to enthymems, whence we are to furnish ourselves with them; for [of those sources], some are elementary propositions, peculiar [to the several branches of rhetoric] ; others are places [of universal applicability]. It follows that

It is therefore plain that some such power exists in relation to rhetoric, as well as to poetry; which [as connected with the latter art! Glauco the Teian. and some others, have

And it depends on the voice, as to how we ought to manage it in reference to each several passion; when, for instance, we should employ a loud, when a low, and when a moderate pitch of voice; and on the manner in which we should employ its tones, viz. the acute, the grave, and the intermediate; and on certain rhythms in reference to each ; for the points, in reference to which they conduct their inquiries, are three, viz. the loudness of the voice, the fitness of its tones, and its rhythm. Now these proficients bear away nearly all the prizes in the disputations ; and as in the other contests<ref n="4"/> the actors now produce a greater effect than the poets, so likewise do they in civil causes, owing to the depravity of

<note type="margin"> 10. ii. From a better class if to embellish: from a lower if to debase. </note> you deduce your metaphor from such things coming under the same class as are better; and if to cry it down, from such as are worse: I mean, as the cases are opposed and come under the same genus, that the saying, for example, of a beggar, that "he prays," and of one who is praying, that " he begs," <stage>(both being species of asking,)</stage> is to do the thing which has been mentioned ; just as Iphicrates called Callias " a mere collector to the goddess, and not a bearer of the torch." He however replied, "that he must needs be uninitiated himself, or he would not call him a collector, but a bearer of the torch." For these are both services connected with the goddess; the one however is respectable, while the other is held in no repute. And some one [speaks of the courtiers of Dionysius as] Dionysian parasites; they however call themselves artificers14. And these expressions are both metaphors; the one of persons who would depreciate, the other the contrary. Even robbers, now-a-day, call themselves purveyors15. On which principle we may say of a man who " has acted unjustly," that he " is in error;" and of one who " is in error," that he "has acted unjustly."

There will also be a fault in the syllables, unless they are significant of a grateful sound; for instance, Dionysius, surnamed Chalcous18, in his elegies, calls poetry, " the clangor of Calliope," because both are vocal sounds ; the metaphor, however, is a paltry one, and couched in uncouth expressions19.</p>

The application. </note> which are beautiful; beauty however of words consists, as Licymnius observes, in the sound or in the idea conveyed; as does also their inelegance. And there is moreover a third 22, which does away the sophistical doctrine; since it is not the fact, as Bryso argues, " that' no one speaks inelegantly, if indeed the using one expression instead of another, carries with it the same meaning:" for this is a fallacy; because some words are nearer in their ordinary acceptations, more assimilated, and have more peculiar force of setting the object before the eyes than others. And what is more, one word represents the object under different circumstances from another; so that we may even on this principle lay it down, that one word has more or less of beauty and inelegance than another: for although both words, [at the same time,] express [properties which are] beautiful, as well as such as are inelegant; yet they either express them not qua they are beautiful, or not qua they are inelegant; or granting they do, yet they express them, the one in a greater, the other in a less degree. But we are to deduce our metaphors from these sources;—from such as are beautiful either in sound, in meaning, or [in the image they present] to the sight, or any other sense. And there is a difference, in the saying, for instance, " the rosy-fingered Aurora;" rather than the purple-fingered;" or, what is still worse, " the crimson-fingered."</p>
<p>Also in the case of epithets, it is very possible to

In the use of compound words; like Lycophron2, where he says, "the many-faced heaven," and " the mighty-topped earth," and " the narrow-pathed shore." And as Gorgias used the expression, " a beggarly-mused flatterer," and " the strictly-bound-by-oath and fully-sworn men."

" he supposed their zeal would be completion-working ;" and " he settled a completion-working persuasiveness of speech;" and " the azure-hued level of the main." For all these expressions, by reason of their being compounded, appear poetical3.</p>
<p>This, then, is one cause: also the employment of

<note type="margin"> 2. ii. Use of foreign words. </note> foreign idioms is one; as when Lycophron calls Xerxes, " prodigious hero," and Sciron, " baneful man 4;" or Alcidamas, when he says, " gambollings in poetry," and " nature's improbity," and " whetted by unrestrained rage of soul."</p>
<p>A third description of frigidity consists in the em-

<note type="margin"> 3. iii. Epitheta too long, too frequent, or out of place. </note> plyment of epithets either too long, out of place, or too frequent; for in poetry, indeed, it is becoming enough to say " white milk;" in prose, however, it is rather bad taste. Some also, should there be a superabundance of them, betray [the rhetorician's art], and make it evident that the whole is a mere made-up thing; this, however, you may occasionally avail yourself of, since it produces a departure from the ordinary style, and renders the diction foreign. Yet ought we to aim at the mean; for [the too free indulgence in the licence] does more harm than the speaking carelessly ; for the one has no beauty, the other has [positive] fault. Hence it is that the writings of Alcidamas appear frigid; for he employs epithets not as the seasoning, but as the food, with such profusion does he scatter them, and those both too long, and where the meaning is self-evident: thus, he does not say the sweat, but the moist sweat5:" nor to the

<note type="margin">3. Instances of similes. </note> The following are similes ; viz. that which Androtion employed against Idrieus,'that " he was like puppies loosed from their chain for they rushing at people bite them, and Idrieus, too, now that he was discharged, was a dangerous person. Again, as Theodamus, in a simile, compared Archidamus to Euxenus, without his knowledge of geometry; on the principles of similar ratios: for [conversely] Euxenus would be Archidamus, had [the latter] a knowledge of geometry. Also the instance which occurs in the Politeia of Plato, that those who spoil the dead are like young dogs, " which bite the stone, without touching the person who throws it." Also the [simile] which he employed against the populace, " that it was like a pilot, strong indeed, but rather deaf." And of the metres of poets, " they are like those in the prime of youth who are without beauty for the latter having lost their freshness, and the former their numerical arrangement, are no longer like the same thing. Also the simile of Pericles against the Samians, [who said] " they were like young children, who indeed accept the sop, but still cry:" and against the Boeotians, that " they were like holm-oaks; for these holm-oaks are cut down by their own means2, as were also the Boeotians, in their contests with each

<note type="footnote" n="2"> Victorius's conjecture as to the means whereby these trees destroy themselves appears rather forced. May there not be some allusion to the original of the lately discovered fable of Phaedrus; in which the trees, having been made to dispute about providing a handle for the woodman's axe, after seeing the fatal use lie makes of the present, acknowledge that they deserve that destruction which they had provided for themselves ?

So, too, Democritus likened the orators to nurses, " who, swallowing the sop themselves, besmear the infants with spittle." And in the same way Antisthenes likened Cephisidotus the slim to frankincense, for " in its consumption it spreads universal delight."</p>
<p>[ Thus the simile is metaphor], for it is free to you to enunciate all these both as metaphors and as similes. So that it is plain that as many as, when enunciated as metaphors, are approved, will also become similes; and [vice versâ] the similes, when without the note [of similitude, will become metaphors. But the metaphor, which is constructed on

<p>The precept of Antimachus, too, is of service, viz. the drawing your expressions from absent qualities 2, which he does in celebrating the hill Teumessus, [commencing,] " There is a certain little hill visited by the winds3;" for thus the subject is carried on to infinity. And this expedient holds good alike in the case of qualities which are good, and such as are bad ., just as the subject has them not, in whichever way it may be of service. Hence the poets deduce their expressions 5, the "stringless" and the lyreless melody;" for they build their epithets on privatives. And this expedient is also approved in analogical metaphors; for instance, the saying of " a trumpet," that it is a " lyreless harmony."

<note type="footnote" n="2"> How much may be made of a mere summary of negations, will readily be acknowledged by those who have read Rochester's poem on Nothing; and another in Latin on the same subject (if subject it may be called), by Passerat, a poet and critic of the sixteenth century, in France.

<note type="footnote">a These words, it will be observed, do not in themselves afford an instance of the precept here recommended; but, as it appears that the work of Antimachus was well known, they were probably intended as a hint at a passage in which an illustration was to be found. Of Aristotle's quotations in general, it may be remarked that, however naturally we might expect to meet with beautiful passages, in illustration of the several beauties of style which he successively discusses, they present but a series of allusions (now obscure and scarcely intelligible), to passages which were easily accessible to his audience, but which have been lost to us amid the general wreck of ancient literature.

The rhythm next to these, is that of two to three, or else its equivalent, three to two; a rhythm compounded of the two former times united; and which constitutes, in musical vibration, what we call the fifth. 'Twas here then they discovered the foot they wanted; that foot which, being neither the heroic nor the iambic, was yet so far connected with them, as to contain virtually within itself the rhythms of them both.”—Philolog.

<p>This [paean] makes a good conclusion; whereas the short syllable, owing to its being incomplete, renders the sentence mutilated.

This Aristotle compares to what he calls the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναβολαὶ</foreign> in dithyrambic poetry; meaning, I think, evidently the long, irregular, protracted odes of the more modem dithyrambic poets: for the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναβολὴ</foreign>, here, does not, I believe, signify exordium, prooemium, as usually understood, but was, probably, the name by which <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠδαὶ μακραὶ καὶ πολυειδεῑς</foreign> were distinguished,' etc. -Twining, note 17. </note>

But it is unpleasant, from its being indefinite; for all like to descry the end.

I call a period a form of words which has independently in itself a beginning and ending, and a length easily taken in at a glance. A diction of this description is pleasing, and easily conveys information : now

And hence every one remembers verse better than prose; for it has numbers by which it is

<note type="margin"> 4. The period must finish with the sense. </note> measured. The period ought also to be terminated with the sense, and not to be interrupted like this verse of Sophocles,-

<note type="margin"> 4 "While other sentences are indefinite, and <stage>(like a geometrical right line)</stage> may be produced indefinitely, the period <stage>(like a circular line)</stage> is always circumscribed, returns and terminates at a given point. In other words, while other sentences, by the help of common copulatives, have a sort of boundless effusion, the constituent parts of a period have a sort of reflex union, in which union the sentence is so far complete, as neither to require, nor even to admit a further extension. Readers find a pleasure in this grateful circuit, which leads them so agreeably to an acquisition of knowledge." Harris, Philolog. Inq. P. ii. c. 4.

<p>A period either consists of clauses, or is simple.

<note type="margin"> 5. A period is either in clauses or simple. </note> But the period consisting of clauses is a mode of speech perfect and distinct, and easily pronounced at a breath; not, however, at the point of division, like the fore-mentioned period, but altogether. And a clause is one subdivision of it. By a simple period, I mean one consisting of a single clause.</p>
<p>But neither the clauses nor the periods ought to

<note type="margin"> 6. They must not be curtailed. </note> be either curtailed or prolix ; for their brevity often causes the hearer to feel a hitch ; since it needs must be, if while he is yet [in thought] hastening onward, that limit of termination which he conceives within himself happens to be thrown back by the speakers ceasing, that a kind of hitch, as it were, occurs, owing to the impulse backward. Those, however, which

<note type="margin"> Nor prolix. </note> are prolix cause the hearer to be left behind; just as they who make the turn too far on the outside of the goal, for they don't keep up with those walking with them 6; and in a similar way, periods which are prolix grow into an oration, and are something like a desultory ode. So that that occurs which Democritus, the Chian, joked Melanippides about, viz. that he produced desultory odes instead of anti strophes. "A man in framing a nuisance for others, frames one for himself; and long tedious odes are the greatest nuisance to him who produces them<ref n="8"/> ; ” for it is appropriate enough to hold such language as this respecting the framers of prolix clauses. But those which are brief in their clauses do not, in fact, become periods ; therefore they draw on the hearer by fits and starts.

Simply divided, as, " I have often felt surprised at those who convened the general assemblies and<ref n="9"/> established the gymnastic contests." The style, however, which has antithesis, is that in which, in each clause, either there is one contrary put in conjunction with another, or the same is linked in connexion with contraries: as, " They benefited both, as well those who remained behind, as those who joined the expedition; since they made acquisitions for the latter more than they possessed at home; while to the former they abandoned, in what remained at home, a full competence.” The ideas set in opposition are,-staying behind,-joining the expedition ; competence,—more. [And in this sentence] : " So that both to those who wanted money, and to those who desired to enjoy it,” etc. Here enjoyment stands opposed to acquisition. And again: ‘‘ It happens frequently in these cases, that while the prudent fail, the simple succeed.”—“ Forthwith, indeed, they claimed the prize of highest valour, and not long after they gained the sovereignty of the sea.”-‟ That he sailed, indeed, through the main land, and marched across the sea; joining with a bridge the Hellespont, while he channelled through mount Athos." Again: " That, citizens though they were by birth, they were yet deprived by law of their franchise in the city.”—“ While some of them miserably perished, others were disgracefully preserved." Again : “ That privately, indeed, he employed barbarian slaves ; while in public he allowed many of the allies to be in slavery —

Latin nouns of the third declension ending in o); at the conclusion, however, of a clause, a weaker and less striking similarity will suffice. Compare his first example with those following the words

Again, when he once was exhorting the Athenians, as they were going for provisions, to go to Eu boea for them, he said, " the decree of Miltiades should go forth to the expedition."

Cephisodotus, too, used to call the triremes, " painted corn-mills:” as did the Cynic Diogenes the taverns, " the public tables 12 of Athens." Aesion, too, used the expression, "pouring out the city into Sicily," <stage>(for this is metaphorical, and sets the object before the eyes,)</stage> " so that all Greece exclaimed and this too is in a certain way a metaphor, and personifies.

And as in the funeral speech [of Lycias], " there was reason for Greece to shear her locks over the grave of those who fell at Salamis, since her liberty had been buried jointly with their valour:" for had he said that " there was reason she should weep, her liberty having been buried with them;" it would indeed have been a metaphor, and have given personification; but the words, "their valour," “ her liberty," convey a kind of antithesis. And, as Iphicrates said, " The path of my arguments is through the midst of the actions of Chares:" the metaphor here is on similar ratios, and the expression, " through the midst," produces personification. Also the saying, " that he challenged dangers to be his allies against dangers," is both a personification and a metaphor. And Lycoleon, pleading for Chabrias, said, " [What, not pardon him] out of a respect for the suppliancy13 of his brazen statue:" for in the then crisis it was a metaphor, but not always; but the personification [was perpetual] ; for pending his trial the statue acts as suppliant, the inanimate as an animated object,—" that memento of the exploits of the state." Again, " Making it their study, by every means, to think meanly;" [this is metaphorical,] since study is with a view to advance [not to diminish].

I mean, then, that those expressions which represent the object as in action, do all of them produce the setting before the eyes: for instance, the saying of “ a good man," that he is " a cube 1,” is a metaphor; for both are perfect; but this does not personify: whereas the speaking of one as " having his prime yet blooming," is a personification. And this, “—but you just as a thing let loose," is a personification.

<p>Also the greatest number of elegancies arise from

<note type="margin"> 6.

I however was wrong." And the elegancies of proverbial expressions arise from one's meaning not what he says; for instance, the words of Stesichorus, that " the grasshoppers shall chirp on the ground 8." Also ideas neatly put enigmatically, are for the same reason pleasing; for there is an acquisition of knowledge, and a metaphor is introduced. Again, that embellishment which

Nep. Iphic. 3;) where it should be observed, that Rutgersius, for contra ea mater, proposes to read cum Thraca mater.

(<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴ</foreign>) of evils." For in either acceptation, that is stated which one did not imagine he would say; and that it is true, is acknowledged. For to assert that a beginning is a beginning, shows no great wisdom; but he repeats [the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀ</foreign>p<foreign xml:lang="grc">χὴ</foreign>], not in this sense, but differently ; and he does not repeat the same
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴ</foreign> which he first said, but in a different sense.
And in all these cases, if one introduce the term

<note type="chapter"> 8. </note> appropriately under an equivocation or metaphor, then there is wit; for instance, there is no bearing Baring 13: here the speaker denies the correspondence of signification, but appropriately enough, if [tbe person alluded to] be disagreeable." Again, " You cannot become more a stranger [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>], than becomes you as a guest [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>]," or not in a greater degree than you ought, which is the same; and " it becomes not a stranger [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>] always to be a guest [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>]." For the meanings here also are different. The same, too, is that commended saying of Anaxandrides, " It is honourable to die before doing aught worthy death;" for it is the same as saying, " It is worthy a man to die when he is not worthy to suffer death;" or, " It is worthy a man to die when he is not worthy [the punishment] of death; or, when he has not committed acts worthy that punishment." Now the form of the diction of these sentences is the

<note type="chapter"> 9. </note> same; but in proportion as [the ideaj happens to be enunciated in fewer words and with antithesis, in the same proportion is it more approved. And the reason is, that the information becomes by means of the antithesis, fuller; by means of brevity, more rapid. Such sentiments ought always to have either some

But in proportion as a sentence possesses the greater number of these ornaments, in the same proportion does it appear more elegant; if, for instance, the words be metaphors, and metaphors of such a species, and if there be antithesis, and equipoise of clauses, and if it have personification.</p>

<note type="margin"> Similes are a sort of metaphor. </note> Similes also, as has been uniformly stated in the foregoing, are in some way approved metaphors; for they always are expressed in two terms, like the analogical metaphor; thus, " the shield," we say, " is the cup of Mars the bow, " a stringless lyre." Thus, then, persons express the metaphor not unaccompanied ; whereas the calling a bow, " a lyre;" or a shield " a cup," is without accompanying explan-

But the excellence will exist when there is a metaphor; for you may represent by a simile the shield as " the cup of Mars," and a ruin as " the rags of a house ;" and the saying of Niceratus, that, " he was himself a Philoctetes bitten by Pratys," as Thrasymachus drew the simile when he saw Niceratus, who had been beaten by Pratys in a contest of rhapsodists 17, with his hair

<p>

<note type="margin">1. Different styles are suitable to each sort of oratory. </note> NEITHER ought it to escape us, that to each kind of rhetoric is adapted a peculiar style; for neither are the style which is adapted to writing and that of disputation the same, nor the style of deliberative and that of judicial rhetoric. But it is necessary to be acquainted with both [the first and the second] : for the one consists in knowing the purity of language ; the other in the not being obliged to sit mute, if one wish to communicate any thing to others; the very predicament in which they who know not how to

But the style of writing is the most precise: that of disputation partakes more of declamation ; and of it there are two species, the one conveys the impress of character, the other of feeling. And hence actors choose this description of drama, and the poets this sort [ of actors]. But poets fit for perusal are carried about with us, like Choeremon, for he is as nicely finished as a rhetorician ; and, of the Dithyrambic poets, Licymnius.</p>
<p>Thus also, on comparing speeches together, those

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XII.] </note>
adapted to writing appear jejune when delivered at disputations ; while those of the declaimers, excellent as they were when delivered, seem mere common- place in the closet; and the reason is, that in disputation [these things are appropriate enough. On which

<note type="margin"> Declamatory compositions when read appear ridiculous. </note> account, compositions framed for declamation, inasmuch as, when abridged of their declamation, they do not produce their effect, appear ridiculous: thus, the omission of connectives, and frequent repetitions, in a written style are justly exploded ; yet in the style of disputation even the rhetoricians employ them, for they are adapted to declamation. Yet it is necessary

<note type="chapter"> 3. </note> in repeating the same thing to vary the expression ; which indeed opens a way, as it were, to declamation: [e. g.] " This is he who robbed you ; this is he who defrauded you ; this is he who at last endeavoured to betray you." Just as Philemon the actor used to do in the " Gerontomania " of Anaxandrides, when Rhadamanthus and Palamedes speak; and in the opening scene of the " Devotees " [in the recurrence of] the word I. For if one does not give these passages with declamation, it becomes [a case in point with the proverb] " Stiff as one carrying a beam." And so also

<note type="chapter"> 4. </note> where connectives are wanting, "I came, I met, I besought him;" for you needs must give it with declamation, and not, as though simply saying one thing, enunciate it with the same manner and tone. There is, moreover, a certain peculiarity which omissions of connectives possess; for it strikes one that, in an equal length of time, many things have been stated ; for the connective makes many, one ; so that if it be taken away, it is evident that on the contrary one will be many. It possesses, then, amplification ; " I came, I conversed with, I besought," being many,— " he seems to overlook all I have said, all I now say." Homer is desirous of producing this effect in the lines: " Three ships with Nireus sought the Trojan shore, Nireus, whom Agläe to Charopus bore, Nireus, in faultless shape 1," etc. POPE.

<note type="margin">5. Deliberative style like sketching, and not accurate. Judicial style more precise. </note> Now the deliberative style is exactly like sketching ; for in proportion as the crowd is larger, the view is taken from a greater distance ; on which account, in the one as well as in the other, productions of an exquisite finish are superfluous, and look worse than others. But the judicial is a thing of greater nicety: and in a still higher degree where it is before a single judge ; for least of all is this within the reach of rhetorical artifice ; since the peculiar points of the case are more easily concentrated to the view, than what is merely external: and the heat of disputation is out of the question, so that the decision is fair and clear. And on this account the same speakers are not approved in all these kinds; but where there is most of declamation, there least of all is accuracy: this, however, is the case where power of voice is requisite, and particularly if a considerable power.</p>

<p>But to draw any further distinctions on the subject of style, that it ought to be pleasing and magnificent, is superfluous: for why should it be such rather than temperate and liberal, or if there be any other moral virtue ? For that the foregoing rules will cause it to be pleasing is manifest, if indeed excellence of style has been correctly defined:—for with a view to what must it be, [according to our definition,] " clear and not mean, but-in good taste?" For should it become prosing, it is no longer clear, neither if it should be too concise. But it is plain that the mean is appropriate. And the foregoing precepts will cause its being pleasing, should the

<p>THE parts of a speech are two; for it is necessary to

Wherefore for one, after stating, not to prove it, or to proceed to prove it without a previous statement, is out of the question: for whoever proves, proves something; and he who makes a previous statement, makes such statement with a view to subsequently proving it. And of these parts, the one is the state-

But the divisions which they now usually make are ridiculous; for narration is a kind of peculiarity to judicial speeches alone; for how can there, in demonstrative and deliberative speeches, be any narration such as they speak of, or any reply, confutation of an adversary, or any peroration of points selected for display of character ?</p>

<p>The prelude, then, corresponds to the exordium of demonstrative speeches; for the performers on the pipe, using as a prelude any piece whatever which they are able to execute with skill, connect the whole by an inserted passage: and so in demonstrative speeches ought we to write; for the speaker ought, after stating whatever he lists straightway to employ the insertion, and link it [to the body of the speech]. Which indeed all do, having as their model the exordium of the Helen of Isocrates: for there exists no very near connexion between Helen and the artifices of sophists2. At the same time, if the exordium be out of the way of the subject, there is this advantage, that the whole speech is not of one uniform character. But the exordia of demonstrative

as was Paris, the son of Priam: for thus the orator

<note type="chapter"> 4. </note> conveys advice. Again [we may borrow demonstrative exordia] from those proper to judicial rhetoric, i. e. from appeals to the auditor, in case the speech be respecting any thing revolting to opinion, or difficult, or already noised abroad among many, so as to obtain his pardon : as Choerilus begins, " Now after every thing has become public."</p>
<p>The exordia, then, of demonstrative rhetoric arise from these sources,-from praise, blame, exhortation, dissuasion, and appeals to the hearers. The inserted connective clauses may be either foreign or appropriate to the subject.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">5. The exordium of judicial oratory resembles the prologue of a play. 6. It must therefore declare the object of the speech. </note> With regard to the exordia of judicial rhetoric, we must assume that they are equivalent to the opening scenes of dramas, and the exordia of epic poems ; for the commencement of dithyrambic poetry resembles demonstrative exordia,—"on account of thee, thy gifts, thy spoils." But in the drama, and in epic poetry, the commencement is an intimation of the subject, that the hearer may foresee what the story is about, and that his mind may not be in suspense ; for whatever is indeterminate bewilders us. He then who puts, as it were, into the hand the beginning of the clue, causes him who holds it to follow on the story.

And the tragedians give some insight into the plot of the drama, if not forthwith, as Euripides does, yet they give it some where at least in the opening scene ; just as also does Sophocles Polybus was my father3!" And comedy in the same way. The most necessary business of the exordium, and this is peculiar to it, is to throw some light on the end for the sake of which the speech is made.

Every thing whatsoever which refers to the doing away or the casting an aspersion of character, has a relation to one's self or the adversary. But these things are not done exactly in the same way: for by one speaking on a defence, whatever tends to aspersion of character should be put first; but by one who is laying an accusation, in his peroration. And the reason why is not indistinct; for it is necessary that one who is making a defence, when he is about to introduce himself, should sweep away every stumblingblock ; so that the prepossession against you must first be removed: by him, however, who raises the unfavourable impression, let it be raised in winding up, in order that the judges may the rather recollect it.</p>
<p>The correctives, however, which refer to the hearer,

<note type="margin"> ii. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ τοῡ ἀκροατοῡ</foreign>, excitement of the hearer; attracting his attention, or the reverse. </note> are drawn out of conciliating his good will, and inflaming him with anger, and occasionally from attracting his attention, or the reverse ; for it is not at all times convenient to render him attentive, for which reason many endeavour to induce them to laughter. But all these will conduce to tractability [on thejudge's part], if one wishes it, as does also the showing one's self a person of character; for to such do people the rather give heed. But men are attentive to objects of importance, of a peculiar description, or deserving admiration, or pleasing. Hence we ought to throw in a hint that the speech is concerning subjects of this nature. But if you would have them not attentive, hint that the matter is trifling, concerns them not, or is disgusting. But it ought not to escape our

<note type="margin">9. Awakening the attention is common to all parts of a speech. </note> Again, the business of exciting attention is common to all the divisions of a speech, wherever it may be necessary; for the audience relax their attention any where rather than at the beginning. For which reason it is ridiculous to range this head at the beginning, when more particularly every one is at the summit of attention. So that, whenever it is convenient, we may use the formulary, "Lend me your whole attention, for the question does not affect me any more than yourselves;" and this one,-" for I will relate to you a thing so strange, so wonderful, as you never yet heard." But this is just what Prodicus says he used to do,—" whenever the audience

But that these things are referred to the hearer not in his proper capacity as such, is evident; for all create unfavourable impressions or do them away in their exordia : as, " O king, I confess indeed, that not with haste," etc.6: and again, " Why such long preludes7."</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">Those who have the worst side employ exordia. </note> They, too, employ exordia who have, or appear to have, the worse case; for it is better to pause any where than on the case itself.

Or confessedly acting unjustly he may offer some equivalent: e. g. though hurtful, yet was it honourable ; though painful, yet was it beneficial ; by some other such expedient.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">3. iii. By extenuation and excuse. </note> Another method is, the arguing that the action is merely a fault, or an error<ref n="1"/> or that it was necessary ; such as the plea of Socrates, " that he trembled, not as the calumniator alleged, that he might appear an old man, but of necessity; since his eighty years of age did not overtake him of his own choice." And you may attempt a commutation of motives; e. g. " that he did not wish to hurt, but to do this or that, and not what the accuser insinuated; but that it so happened that hurt was sustained. But that it were fair enough to hate him, had he acted purposely with a view to this taking place."</p>

Another, in raising a counter prejudice against the calumniator ; for it is absurd, if, while the man is himself void of credit, his words obtain it. Another, in inquiring whether a decision has been already made; just as Euripides did in reply to Hygiaenon, who, in an action of Antidosis, accused him as being an impious person, inasmuch as exhorting to perjury he wrote,—" The tongue hath sworn, but the mind is unsworn 2;" for Euripides argued, "that by bringing into court the decisions of the Dionysiac contest he acted unjustly; for there he had given, or would give an account, should he wish to impeach him." Another, in impeaching calumny itself, as to how

<p>But the citing presumptive signs is a topic common to both parties: thus, in the Teucer, Ulysses insinuates that " he is of kin to Priam; for [his mother] Hesione was Priam's sister." He, however, replies on the ground that, " Telamon, his father, was the enemy of Priam, and that he did not denounce the spies."</p>
<p>Another, peculiar to an accuser, is, for one after

<note type="margin"> 10. xi. Praising a little to blame much. This suits the accuser. </note> bestowing short praise to censure at great length, putting forward great virtues briefly, or very many [which are not relevant], then to censure in one point which bears home upon the case. Such methods are the most crafty and malignant; for they attempt injury by means of one's virtues, by blending them with a man's failings.</p>
<p>But it is a resource common to the calumniator

<note type="margin"> xii. By assuming the motives which suit your purpose. </note> and one who meets a calumny, that, as it is possible for the same action to have been done from many motives, by the calumniator, indeed, facts should be taken in a bad sense, as he makes his selection of motives on the worse side; while by the respondent

<note type="margin">1. The narration in epideictic oratory is not continuous but disjointed. </note> IN demonstrative speeches the narration is not given in continuity, but in scattered portions ; for one must go over the actions out of which the speech arises: for a speech is a kind of compound, having one portion, indeed, independent of art, [since the speaker is not at all the cause of the actions themselves,] and another portion originating in art; and this last is either the showing that it is fact should it be incredible, or such either in character or degree, or in show-

<note type="chapter"> 2. </note> ing all these points at once. Owing to this, there are times when one ought not to narrate every fact successively ; because this mode of exposition is difficult to remember. From some, then, establish the character for courage, from others for wisdom, and from others for justice. The one style of narration is too simple ; the other has the grace of variety, and is not

<note type="chapter"> 3. </note> so void of elegance. But you have only to awaken the recollection of facts well known; on which account, many subjects will stand in no need of narration : supposing, for instance, you would praise Achilles, because all are acquainted with his actions ; but you must employ them at once. But in praising Critias, an orator must narrate; for not many are acquainted with his exploits.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin">4. In judicial, the narration must </note> But now people tell us, ridiculously enough, that the narration should be rapid. And yet I would say, as did one to a baker, who inquired whether he

<note type="margin"> make the subject clear, </note> said he, " is it then impossible to knead it properly ? And so here [in rhetoric a mean is to be observed]. For one should not narrate at too great length, just as he should not make too long an exordium, nor state his proofs [too fully]. For neither in this case does propriety consist either in rapidity or conciseness, but in a mean betwixt both: and this is the stating just so much as will make the matter clear, or as will cause one to conceive that it has taken place, or that the party has inflicted hurt, or committed injustice, or that the case is of that importance which the speaker wishes to establish; and to the opposite party the opposite points will avail. And

<note type="margin"> 5. and bias the audience in favour of the orator. </note> an orator should narrate, by the bye, such incidents as conduce to his own excellence: thus, " I all along used to instruct them in what was just, bidding them not to abandon their children,"—or, to the villany of the other party;- " -but he replied to me, that wherever he might be he should have other children." Which, Herodotus says, was the reply of the Egyptians on their revolting. Or whatever is pleasing to the judges.</p>
<p>In the case of a defendant, the matter will be more

<note type="margin"> 6. The defendant's narration is brief;
</note>brief; the points for dispute being, either that it has
not taken place, or is not hurtful, or not unjust, or not of such importance. So that on acknowledged points he need not pause, unless they conduce in some degree to the objects suggested; e. g. if the fact be acknowledged, but its injustice disputed. Moreover, you should mention as already done those

<note type="chapter"> 7. </note> things which, in the course of being done, failed of producing pity or horror. The story of Alcinous is an instance, which is despatched to Penelope in sixty verses. And as Phäyllus does in the circle, and the opening scene of the CEneus. The narra-

<note type="margin"> ii. By narration of the concomitant circumstances. iii. By speaking with feeling. </note> they treat concerning subjects of this kind. But those things convey a notion of character, which is consequent upon the several characters 3; e. g. " Whilst saying this he began to hasten off for this manifests a hardihood and rusticity of character. And be cautious not to speak coldly as from the understanding merely, as orators do now-a-days, but as though from the deliberate choice 4. " I, for I wished and deliberately preferred this; and if I profit nothing by it, then it is the more honourable:" for the one is characteristic of a prudent, the other of a good man : since [the proposed end] of the prudent consists in pursuing the expedient; of a good man, in pursuing what is honourable. And should any circumstance be incredible, you must subjoin the reason; as Sophocles does. He furnishes an example in the Antigone, that she mourned more for her brother than for a husband or children; for these, if lost, might again be hers.

<note type="margin"> cial oratory has law for a basis. iii. The deliberative orator cannot digress so easily. </note> one who has something wherewith to begin, it is easier to discover means of proof. Neither has [deliberative rhetoric] many opportunities of digression; none, for instance, in reference to an adversary, or respecting one's self, or in order to excite passion6; but it possesses these opportunities least of all the three branches, unless it depart from its proper province. If, then, you are at a loss, you should do what the rhetoricians at Athens do, and particularly Isocrates; for in the course of deliberative speaking he accuses the Lacedaemonians, for instance, in the panegyric, and Chares in the speech about the alliance. But in demonstrative speaking, you should

<note type="chapter"> 11. </note> insert praise in the speech by way of episode, as Isocrates does, for he all along keeps introducing something. And that saying of Gorgias, " That he never failed of something to say," is nothing more nor less than this: for if he be speaking of Achilles, he praises Peleus, then Aeacus, then his goddess mother, and so, too, valour in the abstract; or he does something or another in this strain.</p>
<p>Now the language of one who possesses proof,

But if you possess not enthymems, let it convey an impression of your character; and the show of goodness more befits a virtuous man, than accuracy of speech.</p>
<p>But of enthymems the refutative are more approved than the confirmative 7: because in the case of as many as produce reductio ad absurdum, it is more plain that a conclusion has really been arrived at; for opposites, when set by each other, are more clearly recognised.

<note type="footnote" n="6"> Now, according to the early part of this work, all this is done easily enough in judicial cases, since there the judge has no personal interest, and easily resigns himself to the speaker; but in deliberative rhetoric, every one addressed is supposed, more or less, to have an interest in the question at issue, and is therefore more jealous of the speakers artifice.

The first speaker must give his proofs and anticipate objections. </note> Touching reasonings directed against the adversary, they are not in any thing different in species ; but it belongs to the province of proof to do away his arguments, some by starting an objection, others by contrary inference8. And the speaker who begins, ought, both in deliberative and judicial rhetoric, first to state his own proofs; and subsequently to meet objections by doing them away, or by treating them with contempt beforehand. But should the points objected to be many, first he must confront the objections, as did Callistratus in the Messeniac assembly; for previously having swept away what his adversaries would be likely to allege in this way, he then

But the last speaker should speak first what makes against the adversary's speech, doing it away, and drawing opposite inferences ; and particularly should his arguments have been well received. For just as one's mind does not cordially receive a person on whom a slur has been previously cast; in the same way neither does it favourably listen to a speech, if the opposite speaker appear to have spoken truly. It is necessary, then, to gain a footing in the hearer's mind for the intended speech; and it will be gained if you sweep away objections: wherefore a speaker, having combated either all, or the most important, or the most approved arguments of his adversary, or those which readily admit a contrary inference, is in this way to substantiate his own case:­ " The fame o' th' Goddesses I '11 first defend,- For Juno and 9."

Just as Socrates, when Meletus denied that he believed in the gods, asked " Whether he asserted the being of any demon ?" When he allowed that he had, Socrates asked, " Whether these demons were not either sons of the gods, or something of divine nature?"

He said it did. " Did you not, then, do that which was wrong?" “Yes, forsooth," replied he, " for I had no better alternative." And as the Lacedaemonian, when called to an account respecting his ephorship, on having the question put, " Whether the rest appeared to him to have perished justly," said they did. " Then," retorted the other, " did you not enact the same things as they ? " And when he acknowledged that he had, " Would not you also," asked the other, "justly perish?" "No, indeed," said he, " for they did this on a bribe; I did not, but merely from judgment." Wherefore one ought not

<note type="margin"> 1. Peroration consists of four things. i. ii. iii. iv. i. We must incline the hearers favourably. </note> THE peroration is composed of four things:—of getting the hearer favourable to one's self, and ill-disposed towards the adversary; and of amplification and extenuation; and of placing the hearer under the influence of the passions; and of awakening his recollection.</p>
<p>For after showing yourself to be on the right side, and your adversary on the wrong, it naturally follows to praise and blame, and to give the last finish. And one of two things the speaker ought to aim at, either to show that he is good relatively to them, [the audience,] or is so absolutely; and that the other party is bad, either relatively to them, or absolutely. And the elements, out of which one ought to get up persons as of such characters, have been stated; both whence one should establish them as bad, and whence

<note type="margin"> 2. ii. We must amplify and diminish. </note> as good. Next to this, these points having been already shown, it follows naturally to amplify or diminish: for the facts must needs be acknowledged, if one be about to state their quantity; for the increase of bodies is from substances previously existing. But the elements, out of which one must amplify and diminish, are above set forth.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin"> 3. ii. We must excite the hearers. </note> Next to this, the facts being clear both as to their nature and degree, it follows that we excite the hearer to passion; such as are, pity, terror, anger, hatred, envy, emulation, and contentiousness: the elements of these also have been stated above.</p>
<p>

<note type="margin"> 4. iv. We must awaken the memory. </note> So that it merely remains to awaken a recollection of what has been before stated. And this we are to do here, in the way in which some erroneous teachers say we should in the exordium: for in order that the facts may be readily perceived, they bid us state them frequently. Now there [in the exordium] indeed we ought to state the case at full, in order that it may not be unknown to the hearer upon what the
<pb n="271"/>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XIX.] </note>
trial turns; here, however, [in the peroration,] merely the means by which it has been proved, and that summarily.</p>
<p>The commencement of the peroration will be, that

<note type="margin"> 5. The peroration must assert that the orator has proved his point. He must compare his arguments with those of his opponent, either ironically, or by interrogation. </note> one has made good what he undertook; so that it will be to be stated, as well what one has adduced, as for what reasons. And it is expressed either by means of a juxtaposition with the adversary's statements; and draw the comparison either between every point whatsoever, which both have stated relative to the same thing; or else not by a direct opposition. " He, indeed, on this subject said so and so ; but I so and so, and for such reasons." Or, by a kind of bantering: thus, "He said so and so, and I so and so." And, " What would he do, had he proved this, and not the other point!" Or by interrogation :-" What has not been fully proved on my side ?" or, " What has this man established?" Either in this way, then, must the speaker conclude, or he must, in natural order, so state his reasoning as it was originally stated; and, again, if he pleases, he may state distinctly that of the adversary's speech. And, for

<ab>
<title type="sub">That Rhetorick is an Art consisting not only in moving the Passions of the Judge; but chiefly in Proofs. And that this Art is Profitable.</title>
</ab>
<p>WE see that all men naturally are able in some sort to accuse and excuse: some by chance; but some by method. This method may be discovered : and to discover Method is all one with teaching an Art. If this Art consisted in Criminations only, and the skill to stir up the Judges, Anger, Envy, Fear, Pity, or other affections; a Rhetorician in well ordered Commonwealths and States, where it is forbidden to digress from the cause in hearing, could have nothing at all to say. For all these perversions of the Judge are beside the question. And that which the pleader is to shew, and the Judge to give sentence on, is this only: ' Tis so: or not so. The rest hath been decided already by the Law-maker; who judging of universals, and future things, could not be corrupted. Besides, 'tis an absurd thing, for a man to make crooked the Ruler he means to use.</p>
<p>It consisteth therefore chiefly in Proofs ; which are Inferences: and all Inferences being Syllogismes, a Logician, if he
<pb n="276"/>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK I. </note>
would observe the difference between a plain Syllogisme, and an Enthymeme, <stage>(which is a Rhetorical! Syllogisme,)</stage> would make the best Rhetorician. For all Syllogismes and Inferences belong properly to Logick; whether they infer truth or probability : and because without this Art it would often come to pass, that evil men by the advantage of natural abilities, would carry an evil cause against a good ; it brings with it at least this profit, that making the pleaders even in skill, it leaves the odds only in the merit of the cause. Besides, ordinarily those that are Judges, are neither patient, nor capable of long Scientifical proofs, drawn from the principles through many Syllogismes; and therefore had need to be instructed by the Rhetorically and shorter way. Lastly, it were ridiculous, to be ashamed of being vanquished in exercises of the body, and not to be ashamed of being inferior in the vertue of well expressing the mind.</p>

<title type="sub">The Definition of Rhetorick.</title>
</ab>
<p>RHETORICK, is that Faculty, by which we understand what will serve our turn, concerning any Subject to win belief in the hearer.</p>
<p>Of those things that beget belief; some require not the help of Art; as Witnesses, Evidences, and the like, which we invent not, but make use of; and some require Art, and are invented by us.</p>
<p>The belief that proceeds from our Invention, comes partly from the behaviour of the speaker; partly from the passions of the hearer: but especially from the proofs of what we alledge.</p>
<p>Proofs are, in Rhetorick, either Examples, or Enthymemes, as in Logick, Inductions, or Syllogismes. For an Example is a short Induction, and an Enthymeme a short Syllogisme ; out of which are left as superfluous, that which is supposed to be necessarily understood by the hearer; to avoid prolixity, and not to consume the time of publick business needlessly 1.

<title type="sub">CHAP. III.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the several kinds of Orations: and of the Principles of Rhetorick.</title>
</ab>
<p>IN all Orations, the Hearer does either hear only; or judge also.</p>
<p>If he hear only, that's one kind of Oration, and is called Demonstrative.</p>
<p>If he judge, he must judge either of that which is to come; or of that which is past.</p>
<p>If of that which is to come, there's another kind of Oration, and is called Deliberative.</p>
<p>If of that which is past; then 'tis a third kind of Oration, called Judicial.</p>
<p>So there are three kinds of Orations; Demonstrative, Judicial, Deliberative.</p>
<p>To which belong their proper times. To the Demonstrative, the Present; To the Judicial, the Past; and to the Deliberative, the time to come.</p>
<p>And their proper Offices. To the Deliberative, Exhortation and Dehortation. To the Judicial, Accusation and Defence. And to the Demonstrative, Praising and Dispraising.</p>
<p>And their proper ends. To the Deliberative, to Prove a thing Profitable, or Unprofitable. To the Judicial, Just, or Unjust. To the Demonstrative, Honourable, or Dishonourable.</p>
<p>The Principles of Rhetorick out of which Enthymemes are to be drawn; are the common Opinions that men have concerning Profitable, and Unprofitable; Just, and Unjust; Honourable, and Dishonourable; which are the points in the several kinds of Orations questionable. For as in Logick, where certain and infallible knowledge is the scope of our proof, the Principles must be all infallible Truths: so in Rhetorick the Principles must be common Opinions, such as the Judge is already possessed with : because the end of Rhetorick is victory ; which consists in having gotten Belief.</p>
<p>And because nothing is Profitable, Unprofitable, Just, Unjust, Honourable, or Dishonourable, but what has been done, or is to be done; and nothing is to be done, that is not possible: and because there be degrees of Profitable, Unprofitable, Just, Unjust, Honourable, and Dishonourable; an Orator must be ready in other Principles; namely, of what is done and not
<pb n="278"/>

<note type="margin"> [ BOOK I. </note>
done; possible and not possible; to come and not to come ; and what is Greater, and what is Lesser; both in general, and particularly applyed to the thing in question ; as what is more and less, generally ; and what is more profitable, and less profitable, etc. particularly.</p>

<title type="sub">CHAP. IV.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Subject of Deliberatives; and the Abilities that are required of him that will deliberate of Business of State.</title>
</ab>
<p>IN Deliberatives there are to be considered the Subject, wherein, and the Ends whereto the Orator exhorteth, or from which he dehorteth.</p>
<p>The Subject is always something in our own power, the knowledge whereof belongs not to Rhetorick, but for the most part to the Politicks; and may be referred in a manner to these five heads.</p>
<p>1. Of levying of Money. To which point he that will speak as he ought to do, ought to know before-hand, the revenue of the State, how much it is, and wherein it consisteth ; and also how great are the necessary charges and expences of the same. This knowledge is gotten partly by a man's own experience, partly by relations, and accounts in writing.</p>
<p>2. Of Peace and War. Concerning which the Counsellor or Deliberator, ought to know the strength of the Commonwealth ; how much it both now is, and hereafter may be: and wherein that power consisteth. Which knowledge is gotten, partly by experience, and relations at home; and partly by the sight of wars, and of their events abroad.</p>
<p>3. Of the Safeguard of the Country. Wherein he only is able to give counsell, that knows the forms, and number, and places of the Garrisons.</p>
<p>4. Of Provision. Wherein to speak well, it is necessary for a man to know what is sufficient to maintain the State; what Commodities they have at home growing; what they must fetch in through need; and what they may carry out through abundance.</p>
<p>5. Of making Laws. To which is necessary so much Political, or Civil Philosophy, as to know what are the several kinds of Governments ; and by what means, either from with-
<pb n="279"/>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. V.] </note>
out or from within, each of those kinds is preserved, or destroyed. And this knowledge is gotten, partly by observing the several Governments in times past, by History; and partly by observing the Government of the times present in several Nations, by Travel.</p>
<p>So that to him that will speak in a Councell of State, there is necessary this; History, Sight of Wars, Travel, Knowledge of the Revenue, Expences, Forces, Havens, Garrisons, Wares, and Provisions in the State he lives in; and what is needful for that State, either to export or import.</p>

<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Ends which the Orator in Deliberatives, propoundeth, whereby to exhort, or dehort.</title>
</ab>
<p>AN Orator in Exhorting always propoundeth Felicity, or some part of Felicity to be attained by the actions he exhorteth unto: and in Dehortation the contrary.</p>
<p>By Felicity, is meant commonly, Prosperity with vertue, or a continual content of the life with surety. And the parts of it are such things as we call good, in body, mind, or fortune ; such as these that follow.</p>
<p>1. Nobility. Which to a State or Nation is, to have been antient inhabitants ; and to have had most antiently, and in most number, famous Generals in the Wars, or men famous for such things as fall under emulation. And to a private man, to have been descended lawfully of a Family, which hath yielded most antiently, and in most number, men known to the World for vertue, riches, or any thing in general estimation.</p>
<p>2. Many and good Children. Which is also publick and private. Publick, when there is much youth in the State endued with vertue, <stage>(namely, of the body, stature, beauty, strength, and dexterity : Of the mind, valour, and temperance)</stage>. Private, when a man hath many such Children, both Male and Female. The vertues commonly respected in Women, are of the body, Beauty, and Stature; Of the mind, Temperance, and Houswifery, without Sordidness.</p>
<p>3. Riches. Which is, Money, Cattel, Lands, Housholdstuffe; with the power to dispose of them.</p>
<p>4. Glory. Which is, the reputation of Vertue, or of the
<pb n="280"/>

<note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note>
possession of suck things as all, or most men, or wise men desire.</p>
<p>5. Honour. Which is, the glory of benefiting, or being able to benefit others. To benefit others, is to contribute somewhat, not easily had, to another marts safety, or riches. The parts of Honour are, Sacrifices, Monuments, Rewards, Dedication of places, Precedence, Sepulchres, Statues, publicA Pensions, Adorations, Presents.</p>
<p>6. Health. Which is the being free from Diseases, with strength to use the body.</p>
<p>7. Beauty. Which is to different Ages different. To Youth, strength of body, and sweetness of aspect. To Full Men, strength of body fitfor the Wars, and Countenance sweet, with a mixture of Terror. To Old Men, strength enough for necessary labours, with a Countenance not displeasing.</p>
<p>8. Strength. Which is the ability to move any thing at pleasure of the Mover. To move, is to pull, to put off, to lift, to thrust down, to press together.</p>
<p>9. Stature. Which is then just, when a man in height, breadth, and thickness of body doth so exceed the most, as nevertheless it be no hindrance to the quickness of his motion.</p>
<p>10. Good old Age. Which is, that which comes late, and with the least trouble.</p>
<p>11. Many and good Friends. Which is, to have many that will do for his sake that which they think will be jor his good.</p>
<p>12. Prosperity. Which is, to have all, or the most, or the greatest of those goods which we attribute to Fortune.</p>
<p>13. Vertue. Which is then to be defined, when we speak of Praise.</p>
<p>These are the grounds from whence we exhort.</p>

<p>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. VI.] </note> The Indisputable Principles are such as these : Good, is that which we love for it self.</p>
<p>And that, for which we love somewhat else.</p>
<p>And that which all things desire.</p>
<p>And that to every man which his reason dictates.</p>
<p>And that, which when we have, we are well, or satisfied.</p>
<p>And that which satisfies.</p>
<p>And the Cause or Effect of any of these.</p>
<p>And that which preserves any of these.</p>
<p>And that which keeps off, or destroys the contrary of any of these.</p>
<p>Also to take the Good, and reject the Evil, is Good.</p>
<p>And to take the greater Good, rather than the less; and the lesser Evil, rather than the greater.</p>

<title type="sub">Of the Colours, or common Opinions concerning Good and Evil, comparatively.</title>
</ab>
<p>THE Colours of Good comparatively depend partly upon the following Definitions of Comparatives.</p>
<p>1. More, is so much, and somewhat besides.</p>
<p>2. Less, is that, which and somewhat else is so much.</p>
<p>3. Greater and more in number are laid only Comparatively to Less, and Fewer in number.</p>
<p>4. Great and Little, Many and Few, are taken Comparatively to the Most of the same kind. So that Great and Many, is that which exceeds; Little and Few, is that which is ex ceeded by the Most of the same kind.</p>
<p>Partly from the precedent Definitions of Good absolutely.</p>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Common Opinions concerning Good Comparatively, then, are these.</title>
</ab>
<p>Greater Good is Many, than fewer, or one of those many.</p>
<p>And Greater is the kind, in which the greatest is greater than the greatest of another kind. And greater is that Good than another good, whose kind is greater than another's kind.</p>
<p>And Greater is that from which another Good follows than the Good which follows.</p>
<p>And of two which exceed a third, Greater is that which exceeds it most.</p>
<p>And that which causes the greater Good.</p>
<p>And that which proceeds from a greater Good.</p>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. VIII.] </note>
must speak of them also in the Concrete; that is, of what is Good or Evil to each sort of Commonwealth in special.</p>
<p>The Government of a Commonwealth, is either Democracy, or Aristocracy, or Oligarchy, or Monarchy.</p>
<p>Democracy is that, wherein all men with equal right, are preferred to the highest Magistracy by Lot.</p>
<p>Aristocracy is that, wherein the highest Magistrate is chosen out of those, that had the best education, according to what the Laws prescribe for best.</p>
<p>Oligarchy is that, where the highest Magistrate is chosen for wealth.</p>
<p>Monarchy is that, wherein one man hath the Government of all; which Government, if he limit by Law, is called Kingdom ; if by his own will, Tyranny.</p>
<p>The end of Democracy, or the Peoples Government, is Liberty.</p>
<p>The end of Oligarchy, is the riches of those that govern.</p>
<p>The end of Aristocracy is good Laws, and good ordering of the City.</p>
<p>The end of Monarchy, or Kings, is the safety of the People, and conservation of his own Authority.</p>
<p>Good therefore, in each sort of Government is that which conduceth to these their ends.</p>
<p>And because belief is not gotten only by proofs, but also from manners; the manners of each sort of Commonwealth ought to be well understood by him that undertaketh to perswade or diswade in matter of State. Their manners may be known by their designs; and their designs by their ends; and their ends by what we see them take pleasure in. But of this more accurately in the Politichs.</p>

<title type="sub">Of the Colours of Honourable and Dishonourable.</title>
</ab>
<p>IN a Demonstrative Oration, the subject whereof is Praise, or Dispraise; the proofs are to be drawn from the Elements of Honourable and Dishonourable.</p>
<p>In this place we anticipate the second way of getting belief; which is from the manners of the Speaker. For Praise, whether it come in as the principal business, or upon the by, depends still upon the same Principles. Which are these :
</p>
<pb n="286"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> [ BOOK I. </note> Honourable, is that, which we love for itself, and is withal laudable.</p>
<p>And that Good, which pleaseth us only because His Good.</p>
<p>And Vertue.</p>
<p>Vertue is the faculty of getting and preserving that which is Good; and the faculty of doing many, and great things well.</p>
<p>The kinds of it are these; 1. Justice; which is a Vertue whereby every man obtains what by Law is his.</p>
<p>2. Fortitude; which is a Vertue by which a man carries himself Honourably, and according to the Laws, in time of danger.</p>
<p>3. Temperance; which is a Vertue whereby a man Governs himself in matter of pleasure according to the Law.</p>
<p>4. Liberality; which is a Vertue, by which we benefit others in matter of money.</p>
<p>5. Magnanimity; which is a Vertue, by which a man is apt to do great benefits.</p>
<p>6. Magnificence; which is a Vertue, by which a man is apt to be at great cost.</p>
<p>7. Prudence; which is an Intellectual Vertue, by which a man is able to deliberate well concerning any Good leading to Felicity.</p>
<p>And Honourable, are the Causes, and effects of things Honourable.</p>
<p>And the Works of Vertue.</p>
<p>And the signs of Vertue.</p>

<p>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. IX.] </note> And of the more Honourable and better men, the Vertues are more Honourable.</p>
<p>And more Honourable are the vertues that tend to other mens benefit, than those which tend to ones own.</p>
<p>And Honourable are those things which are Just.</p>
<p>And Revenge is Honourable.</p>
<p>And Victory.</p>
<p>And Honour.</p>
<p>And Monuments.</p>
<p>And those things which happen not to the living.</p>

<p>And that which seems Honourable; Namely such as follow.</p>
<p>Vices confining upon Vertue.</p>
<p>And the extreams of Vertues.</p>
<p>And what the Auditors think Honourable.</p>
<p>And that which is in estimation.</p>
<p>And that which is done according to custom.</p>
<p>Besides, in a Demonstrative Oration, the Orator must shew, that he whom he praiseth, did what he praiseth unconstrainedly, and willingly.</p>
<p>And he does so, who does the same often.</p>
<p>Praise, is speech, declaring the magnitude of a Vertue, Action, or Work.</p>
<p>But to praise the Work from the Vertue of the Worker, is a circular proof.</p>
<p>To Magnify and to Praise, differ in themselves, as Felicity and Vertue. For Praise declares a mans Vertue ; and Magnifying declares his Felicity.</p>
<p>Praise is a kind of inverted Precept. For to say, Do it because 'tis good, is a Precept. But to say, He is good because he did it, is Praise.</p>
<p>An Orator in Praising must also use the forms of Amplification; such as these :</p>
<p>He was the first that did it.</p>
<p>The only man that did it.</p>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK I. </note> The special man that did it.</p>

<p>He was the cause, that the Law ordained Rewards and Honours for such Actions.</p>
<p>Further, he that will praise a Man, must compare him with others; and his actions with the actions of others; especially with such as are renowned.</p>
<p>And Amplification is more proper to a Demonstrative Oration, than to any other. For here the Actions are confessed; and the Orators part is only this, to contribute unto them Magnitude and Luster.</p>

<title type="sub">Of Accusation and Defence, with the Definition of Injury.</title>
</ab>
<p>IN a Judicial Oration, which consists in Accusation and Defence, the thing to be proved is, that Injury has been done: and the heads from whence the proofs are to be drawn, are these three:</p>
<p>1. The causes that move to Injury.</p>
<p>2. The Persons apt to do Injury.</p>
<p>3. The Persons obnoxious, or apt to suffer Injury.</p>
<p>An Injury is a voluntary offending of another man contrary to the Law.</p>
<p>Voluntary is that which a man does with knowledge, and without compulsion.</p>
<p>The causes of Voluntary Actions are Intemperance, and a Vicious disposition concerning things Desirable. As the Covetous man does against the Law, out of an intemperate desire of Money.</p>
<p>All Actions proceed either from the doers disposition, or not.</p>
<p>Those that proceed not from the Doers disposition are such as he does by Chance, by Compulsion, or by Natural necessity.</p>
<p>Those that proceed from the Doers disposition, are such as he does by Custom, or upon Premeditation, or in Anger, or out of Intemperance.</p>
<p>By Chance are said to be done those things whereof neither the Cause, nor the Scope is evident; and which are done nei-

ther orderly, nor always, nor most commonly after the same manner.</p>
<p>By Nature are said to be done those things, the Causes whereof are in the Doer; and are done orderly, and always, or for the most part after the same manner.</p>
<p>By Compulsion are done those things, which are against the Appetite, and Ordination of the Doer.</p>
<p>By Custom those Actions are said to be done, the Cause whereof is this, that the Doer has done them often.</p>
<p>Upon Premeditation are said to be done those things which are done for profit, as the End, or the way to the End.</p>
<p>In Anger are said to be done those things which are done with a purpose to Revenge.</p>
<p>Out of Intemperance are said to be done those things which are delightful.</p>
<p>In sum, every Voluntary Action tends either to Profit or Pleasure.</p>

<title type="sub">Of those Things which are necessary to be known for the Definition of Just and Unjust.</title>
</ab>
<p>WHEN the fact is evident, the next Inquiry is, whether it be Just, or Unjust.</p>
<p>For the Definition of Just and Unjust, we must know what Law is: that is, what the Law of Nature, what the Law of
<pb n="294"/>

<note type="margin"> [ BOOK I. </note>
Nations; what the Law Civil, what written Law, and what unwritten Law is: and what Persons, that is, what a publick Person, or the City is; and what a private Person, or Citizen is.</p>
<p>Unjust in the opinion of all men, is that which is contrary to the Law of Nature.</p>
<p>Unjust in the opinion of all men of those Nations which traffick and come together, is that which is contrary to the Law common to those Nations.</p>
<p>Unjust only in one Common-wealth, is that which is contrary to the Law Civil, or Law of that Common-wealth.</p>
<p>He that is accused to have done any thing against the Publick, or a private Person, is accused to do it either ignorantly, or unwillingly, or in anger, or upon premeditation.</p>
<p>And because the Defendant does many times confess the fact, but deny the unjustice; as that he took, but did not steal; and did, but not adultery; it is necessary to know the Definitions of Theft, Adultery, and all other crimes.</p>
<p>What facts are contrary to the written Laws, may be known by the Laws themselves.</p>
<p>Besides written Laws, whatsoever is Just, proceeds from Equity or Goodness.</p>
<p>From Goodness proceeds that which we are praised, or honoured for.</p>
<p>From Equity proceed those actions, which though the written LaM command not, yet being interpreted reasonably, and supplyed, seems to require at our hands.</p>
<p>Actions of Equity are such as these,</p>
<p>Not too rigorously to punish Errors, Mischances, or Injuries.</p>
<p>To pardon the faults that adhere to Mankind.</p>
<p>And not to consider the Law so much, as the Law-makers mind; and not the Words so much, as the meaning of the Law1.</p>
<p>And not to regard so much the Fact, as the intention of the Doer; nor part of the Fact, but the Whole; nor what the Doer is, but what he has been always, or for the most part.

<p>And he that does it often.</p>
<p>Greater Injury is that, against which Laws and Penalties were first made.</p>
<p>And that which is more brutal, or more approaching to the actions of beasts.</p>
<p>And that which is done upon more premeditation.</p>
<p>And by which more Laws are broken.</p>
<p>And which is done in the place of Execution.</p>
<p>And which is of greatest shame to him that receives the Injury.</p>
<p>And which is committed against well deservers.</p>
<p>And which is committed against the unwritten Law; because good men should observe the Law for Justice, and not for fear of punishment.</p>
<p>And which is committed against the written Law ; because he that will do Injury, neglecting the penalty set down in the written Law, is much more likely to transgress the unwritten Law, where there is no penalty at all.</p>

<title type="sub">Of Proofs Inartificial.</title>
</ab>
<p>OF Artificial Proofs we have already spoken.</p>
<p>Inartificial Proofs, which we invent not, but make use of, are of five sorts.</p>
<p>1. Laws. And those are Civil, or written Law: the Law or Custom of Nations: and the universal Law of Nature.</p>
<p>2. Witness. And those are such as concern Matter; and such as concern Manners. Also, they be ancient, or present.</p>
<p>3. Evidences, or Writings.</p>
<p>4. Question, or Torture.</p>
<p>5. Oaths. And those be either given, or taken, or both, or neither.</p>
<p>For Laws, we use them thus:</p>
<p>When the written Law makes against us, we appeal to the Law of Nature, alledging,</p>
<p>That to be greatest Justice, which is greatest Equity.</p>
<p>That the Law of Nature is immutable; the written Law mutable.</p>
<p>That the written Law is but seeming justice; the Laic of Nature very Justice. And Justice is among those things which are, and not which seem to be.</p>
<p>That the Judge ought to discern between true and adulterate Justice.</p>
<p>That they are better men that obey unwritten, than written Laws.</p>
<p>That the Law against us does contradict some other Law. And when the Law has a double interpretation, that is the true one, which makes for us.</p>
<p>And that the cause of the Lar being abolished, the Law is no more of Validity.</p>
<p>But when the written Law makes for us, and Equity for the Adversary, we must alledge,</p>
<p>That a man may use Equity, not as a liberty to judge against the Law; but only as a security against being forsworn, when he knows not the Law.</p>
<p>That men seek not Equity because 'tis good simply, but because good for them.</p>
<pb n="297"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XVI.] </note></p>
<p>That it is the same thing not to make, and not to use the Law.</p>
<p>That as in other Arts, and namely in Physick, fallacies are pernitious; so in a Common-wealth 'tis pernitious to use pretexts against the Law.</p>
<p>And that in Common-wealths well instituted, to seem wiser than the Laws, is prohibited.</p>
<p>For Witnesses, we must use them thus:</p>
<p>When we have them not, we must stand for Presumptions, and say,</p>
<p>That in Equity sentence ought to be given according to the most probability.</p>
<p>That Presumptions are the testimony of the things themselves, and cannot be bribed.</p>
<p>That they cannot lye.</p>
<p>When we have Witnesses, against him that has them not, we must say,</p>
<p>That Presumptions, if they be false, cannot be punished.</p>
<p>That if Presumptions were enough, Witnesses were superfluous.</p>
<p>For Writings, when they favour us, we must say, That Writings are private and particular Laws; and he that takes away the use of Evidences, abolisheth the Law.</p>
<p>That since Contracts and Negotiations pass by Writings, he that bars their use, dissolves humane Society.</p>
<p>Against them, if they favour the Adversary, we may say, That since Laws do not bind, that are fraudulently made to pass, much less Writings.</p>
<p>And that the Judge being to dispense Justice, ought rather to consider what is just, than what is in the Writing.</p>
<p>That Writings may be gotten by fraud or force; but Justice by neither.</p>
<p>That the Writing is repugnant to some Law, Civil, or Natural; or to Justice; or to Honesty.</p>
<p>That 'tis repugnant to some other Writing before, or after.</p>
<p>That it crosses some commodity of the Judge <stage>(which must not be said directly, but implyed cunningly)</stage>.</p>
<p>For the Torture, if the giving of it make for us, we must say,</p>
<p>That 'tis the only testimony that is certain.</p>
<p>But if it make for the Adversary, we may say,</p>
<p>That men inforced by Torture, speak as well that which is false, as that which is true.</p>
<pb n="298"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> [ BOOK I. </note> That they who can endure, conceal the truth; and they who cannot, say that which is false to be delivered from pain.</p>
<p>For Oaths; he that will not put his Adversary to his</p>
<p>Oath, may alledge, That he makes no scruple to be forsworn.</p>
<p>That by swearing, he will carry the cause; which not swearing, he must lose.</p>
<p>That he had rather trust his cause in the hand of the Judge, than of the Adversary.</p>
<p>He that refuseth to take the Oath, may say, That the matter is not worth so much.</p>
<p>That if he had been an evil man, he had sworn, and carryed his cause.</p>
<p>That to try it by swearing for a religious man against an irreligious, is as hard A match, as to set a weak man against a strong in combate.</p>
<p>He that is willing to take the Oath, may pretend, That he had rather trust himself, than his Adversary; and that 'tis equal dealing for an irreligious man to give, and for a religious man to take the Oath.</p>
<p>That 'tis his duty to take the Oath, since he has required to have sworn Judges.</p>
<p>He that offers the Oath may pretend, That he does piously commit his cause to the Gods.</p>
<p>That he makes his Adversary himself Judge.</p>
<p>That 'twere absurd for him not to swear, that has required the Judges to be sworn.</p>
<p>And of these are to be compounded the Forms we are to use, when we would give, and not take the Oath; or take, and not give ; or both give and take ; or neither give nor take.</p>
<p>But if one have sworn contrary to a former Oath, he may pretend, That he was forced.</p>
<p>That he was deceived, and that neither of these is Perjury, since Perjury is voluntary.</p>
<p>But if the Adversary do so, he may say, That he that stands not to what he hath sworn, subverteth humane Society.</p>
<p>And <stage>(turning to the Judge)</stage> What reason have we to require, that you should be sworn, that judge our cause; when we will not stand to that we swear ourselves.</p>

<p>The other two parts follow; whereof one ariseth from the manners of the Speaker; the other from the passions of the Hearer.</p>
<p>The Principles, Colours, or Common Opinions upon which a mans belief is grounded concerning the manners of him that speaks, are to be had partly out of that which hath been said before concerning Vertue, book i. chap. 9, partly out of those things which shall be said by and by, concerning the Passions. For a man is believed either for his Prudence, or for his Probity, which are Vertues; or for Good Will: of which among the Passions.</p>
<p>The Principles concerning Belief, arising from the Passion of the Hearer, are to be gathered from that which shall now be said of the several Passions in order.</p>

<title type="sub">Of Anger.</title>
</ab>
<p>ANGER is desire of Revenge, joyned with grief for that he, or some of his, is, or seems to be neglected.</p>
<p>The object of Anger is always some particular, or individual thing.</p>
<pb n="300"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> In Anger there is also pleasure proceeding from the imagination of revenge to come.</p>
<p>To Neglect, is to esteem little or nothing: and of three kinds.</p>
<p>1. Contempt.</p>
<p>2. Crossing.</p>
<p>3. Contumely.</p>
<p>Contempt, is when a man thinks another of little worth in comparison to himself.</p>
<p>Crossing, is the hinderance of another mans will without design to profit himself.</p>
<p>Contumely, is the disgracing of another for his own pastime.</p>
<p>The common Opinions concerning Anger are therefore such as follow:</p>
<p>They are easily Angry that think they are neglected.</p>
<p>That think they excell others; as the Rich with the Poor ; the Noble with the Obscure, etc.</p>
<p>And such as think they deserve well.</p>
<p>And such as grieve to be hindered, opposed, or not assisted. And therefore sick men, poor men, lovers, and generally all that desire and attain not, are angry with those that standing by, are not moved with their wants.</p>
<p>And such as having expected good, find evil.</p>
<p>Those that men are angry with, are, Such as mock, deride, or jest at them.</p>
<p>And such as shew any kind of Contumely, towards them.</p>
<p>And such as despise those things which we spend most labour and study upon : and the more, by how much we seem the less advanced therein.</p>
<p>And our friends, rather than those that are not our friends.</p>
<p>And such as have honoured us, if they continue not.</p>
<p>And such as requite not our courtesie.</p>
<p>And such as follow contrary courses, if they be our inferiours.</p>
<p>And our friends, if they have said, or done us evil, or not good.</p>
<p>And such as give not eare to our intreaty.</p>
<p>And such as are joyful, or calm in our distress.</p>
<p>And such as troubling us, are not themselves troubled.</p>
<p>And such as willingly hear or see our disgraces.</p>
<p>And such as neglect us in the presence of our Competitors; of those we admire ; of those we would have admire us ; of those we reverence; and of those that reverence us.</p>

<p>And such as are in jest, when we are in earnest.</p>

<p>RECONCILIATION is the appeasing of Anger.</p>
<p>Those to whom men are easily reconciled, are, Such as have not offended out of neglect.</p>
<p>And such as have done it against their will.</p>
<p>And such as wish done the contrary of what they have done.</p>
<p>And such as have done as much to themselves.</p>
<p>And such as confess and repent.</p>
<p>And such as are humbled.</p>

<p>And such as have done them more good heretofore, than now hurt.</p>
<p>And such as sue to them for any thing.</p>
<p>And such as are not insolent, nor mockers, nor slighters of others in their own disposition.</p>
<p>And generally such as are of a contrary disposition to those, whom men are usually angry withal.</p>
<p>And such as they fear or reverence.</p>
<p>And such as reverence them.</p>
<p>And such as have offended their Anger.</p>
<p>Reconcileable are, Such as are contrarily affected to those whom we have said before to be easily angry.</p>
<p>And such as play, laugh, make merry, prosper, live in plenty ; and in sum, all that have no cause of grief.</p>
<p>And such as have given their anger time.</p>
<p>Men lay down their Anger for these Causes.</p>
<p>Because they have gotten the Victory.</p>
<p>Because the Offender has suffered more than they meant to inflict.</p>

<p>And because the Offender is dead.</p>
<p>Whosoever therefore would asswage the anger of his Auditor, must make himself appear such, as men use to be reconciled unto: and beget in his Auditor such opinions, as make him reconcileable.</p>

<p>And such as are officious towards us.</p>
<p>And those that are like us.</p>

<p>And such as speak their mind.</p>

<title type="sub">Of Enmity and Hatred.</title>
</ab>
<p>THE Colours, or Common Opinions concerning Hatred are to be taken from the contrary of those, which concern Love and Friendship.</p>
<p>Hatred differs from Anger in this, That Anger regards only what is done to ones self; but Hatred not.</p>
<p>And in this, that Anger regards particulars only; the other universals also.</p>

<p>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> And in this, that Anger is curable, Hatred not.</p>
<p>And in this, that Anger seeks the vexation, Hatred the damage of ones Adversary.</p>
<p>That with Anger there is always joined Grief; with Hatred not always.</p>
<p>That Anger may at length be satiated, but Hatred never.</p>
<p>Hence it appears how the Judge or Auditor may be made Friend or Enemy to us; and how our Adversary may be made appear Friend or Enemy to the Judge; and how we may answer to our Adversary, that would make us appear Enemies to him.</p>

<title type="sub">Of Fear.</title>
</ab>
<p>FEAR is a trouble, or vexation of the mind, arising from the apprehension of an evil at hand, which may hurt or destroy.</p>
<p>Danger is the nearness of the evil feared.</p>
<p>The things to be feared, are, Such as have power to hurt.</p>
<p>And the signs of will to do us hurt, as Anger and Hatred of powerful men.</p>
<p>And Injustice joyned with Power.</p>
<p>And Valour provoked, joyned with Power.</p>
<p>And the fear of powerful men.</p>
<p>The men that are to be feared, are, Such as know our Faults.</p>
<p>And such as can do us Injury.</p>
<p>And such as think they are injured by us.</p>
<p>And such as have done us Injury.</p>
<p>And our Competitors in such things as cannot satisfie both.</p>
<p>And such as are feared by more powerful men than we are.</p>
<p>And such as have destroyed greater men than we are.</p>
<p>And such as use to invade their inferiours.</p>
<p>And men not passionate, but dissemblers, and crafty, are more to be feared than those that are hasty and free.</p>
<p>The things especially to be feared, are, Such, wherein if we err, the error cannot be repaired; at least, not according to ours, but our Adversaries pleasure.</p>
<p>And such as admit either none, or not easie help.</p>

<p>They that fear not, are, Such as expect not evil; or not now; or not this; or not from these.</p>
<p>And therefore men fear little in prosperity.</p>
<p>And men fear little that think they have suffered already.</p>
<p>An Orator therefore that would put Fear into the Auditor, must let him see that he is obnoxious ; and that greater than he do suffer, and have suffered from those, and at those times they least thought.</p>

<p>ASSURANCE is hope, arising from an imagination that the help is near, or the evil afar off.</p>
<p>The things therefore that beget Assurance are, The remoteness of those things that are to be feared, and the nearness of their contraries.</p>
<p>And the facility of great, or many helps or remedies.</p>
<p>And neither to have done, nor received Injury.</p>
<p>And to have no Competitors, or not great ones, or if great ones, at least friends; such as we have obliged, or are obliged to.</p>
<p>And that the danger is extended to more, or greater than us.</p>
<p>Assured, or Confident, are, They that have oft escaped danger.</p>
<p>And they to whom most things have succeeded well.</p>
<p>And they that see their Equals, or inferiours not afraid.</p>
<p>And they that have wherewith to make themselves feared, as wealth, strength, etc.</p>
<p>And such as have done others no wrong.</p>
<p>And such as think themselves in good terms with God Almighty.</p>
<p>And such as think they will speed well that are gone before.

<p>SHAME is a perturbation of the Mind arising from the apprehension of Evil, past, present, or to come, to the prejudice of a mans own, or his friends reputation.</p>
<p>The things therefore which men are ashamed of are those Actions which proceed from Vice, as,</p>
<p>To throw away ones Arms; to run away; signs of Cowardliness.</p>
<p>To deny that which is committed to ones trust, a sign of Injustice.</p>
<p>To have lyen with whom, where, and when we ought not, signs of Intemperance.</p>
<p>To make gain of small and base things ; not to help with money whom and how much we ought; to receive help from meaner men ; to ask money at use from such as one thinks will borrow of him; to borrow of him that expects payment of somewhat before lent; and to redemand what one has lent, of him that one thinks will borrow more; and so to praise, as one may be thought to ask; signs of Wretchedness.</p>
<p>To praise one to his face; to praise his vertues too much, and colour his vices ; signs of Flattery.</p>
<p>To be unable to indure such labours as men indure that are elder, tenderer, greater in quality, and of less strength than he ; signs of Effeminacy.</p>
<p>To be beholden often to another; and to upbraid those that are beholding to him; signs of Pusillanimity.</p>
<p>To speak and promise much of ones self more than is due ; signs of Arrogance.</p>
<p>To want those things which ones Equals, all, or most of them have attained to, is also a thing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>And to suffer things ignominious, as to serve about an others person ; or to be imployed in his base Actions.</p>
<p>In Actions of Intemperance, whether willingly, or unwillingly committed; there is shame in Actions of Force, only when they are done unwillingly.</p>

<title type="sub">Of Indignation.</title>
</ab>
<p>OPPOSITE in a manner to Pity in good Men, is Indignation, which is grief for the prosperity of a Man unworthy.</p>
<p>With Indignation there is always joyned a joy for the prosperity of a Man worthy, as Pity is always with contentment in the adversity of them that deserve it.</p>
<p>In wicked Men the opposite of Pity is, Envy; as also the companions thereof delight in the harm of others, which the Greeks in one word have called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπικαιρεκακία</foreign>. But of these in the next Chapter.</p>
<p>Men conceive Indignation against others, not for their vertues, as Justice, etc.</p>
<p>For these make Men worthy ; and in Indignation we think Men unworthy.</p>
<p>But for those goods which men indued with vertue, and noble Men, and handsome Men are worthy of.</p>
<pb n="310"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> [ BOOK II. </note> And for newly gotten power and riches, rather than for antient, and especially if by these he has gotten other goods, as by Riches, Command. The reason why we conceive greater Indignation against new than antient Riches, is, that the former seem to possess that which is none of theirs. But the antient seem to have but their own. For with common people, to have been so long, is to be so by Right.</p>
<p>And for the bestowing of goods incongruously: as when the arms of the most valiant Achilles were bestowed on the most eloquent Ulysses.</p>
<p>And for the comparison of the inferiour is the same thing, as when one valiant is compared with a more valiant; or whether absolutely superiour, as when a good Scholer is compared with a good Man.</p>
<p>Apt to Indignation are, They that think themselves worthy of the greatest goods, and do possess them.</p>
<p>And they that are good.</p>
<p>And they that are ambitious.</p>
<p>And such as think themselves deserve better what another possesseth, than he that hath it.</p>
<p>Least apt to Indignation are, Such as are of a poor, servile, and not ambitious Nature.</p>
<p>Who they are that Rejoyce, or Grieve not, at the adversity of him that suffers worthily, and in what occasions may be gathered from the contrary of what has been already said.</p>
<p>Whosoever therefore would turn away the Compassion of the Judge, he must make him apt to Indignation; and shew that his Adversary is unworthy of the Good, and worthy of the Evil which happens to him.</p>

<ab>
<title type="sub">Of Envy.</title>
</ab>
<p>ENVYis grief, for the prosperity of such as our selves, arising not from any hurt that we, but from the good that they receive.</p>
<p>Such as our selves, I call those that are equal to us in blood, in age, In abilities, in glory, or in means.</p>
<p>They are apt to Envy, That are within a little of the highest.</p>
<pb n="311"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XII.] </note> And those that are extraordinarily honoured for some quality that is singular in them, especially Wisdom or good Fortune.</p>
<p>And such as would be thought wise.</p>
<p>And such as catch at glory in every action.</p>
<p>And Men of poor spirits: for every thing appears great to them.</p>
<p>The things which Men Envy in others are, Such as bring Glory.</p>
<p>And goods of Fortune.</p>
<p>And such things as we desire for our selves.</p>
<p>And things in the possession whereof we exceed others, or they us a little.</p>
<p>Obnoxious to Envy are, Men of our own time, of our own Countrey, of our own age, and competitors of our Glory.</p>
<p>And therefore, Those whom we strive with for honour.</p>
<p>And those that covet the same things that we do.</p>
<p>And those that get quickly, what we hardly obtain, or not at all.</p>
<p>And those that attain unto, or do the things that turn to our reproach, not being done by us.</p>
<p>And those that possess what we have possessed heretofore. So old and decayed Men envy the young and lusty.</p>
<p>And those that have bestowed little, are subject to be envyed by such as have bestowed much upon the same thing.</p>
<p>From the contraries of these may be derived the Principles concerning Joy for other Mens hurt.</p>
<p>He therefore that would not have his Enemy prevail, when be craves Pity, or other favour ; must dispose the Judge to Envy; and make his Adversary appear such, as above described, to be subject to the Envy of others.</p>

<ab>
<title type="sub">Of Emulation.</title>
</ab>
<p>EMULATION is grief arising from that our Equals possess such goods as are had in honour, and whereof we are capable, but have them not; not because they have them, but because not we also.</p>
<pb n="312"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> [ BOOK II. </note> No Man therefore Emulates another in things whereof himself is not capable.</p>
<p>Apt to Emulate are, Such as esteem themselves worthy of more than they have.</p>
<p>And Young and Magnanimous Men.</p>
<p>And such as already possess the goods for which Men are honoured : for they measure their worth by their having.</p>
<p>And those that are esteemed worthy by others.</p>
<p>And those whose Ancestors, Kindred, Familiars, Nation, City, have been eminent for some good, do Emulate others for that good.</p>
<p>Objects of Emulation are, for things ; Vertues. And things whereby we may profit others.</p>
<p>And things whereby we may please others.</p>
<p>For Persons, They that possess such things.</p>
<p>And such as many desire to be friends or acquainted with, or like unto.</p>
<p>And they whose praises flie abroad.</p>
<p>The contrary of Emulation is Contempt.</p>
<p>And they that Emulate such as have the goods aforementioned, Contemn such as have them not: and thence it is, that Men who live happily enough, unless they have the goods which Men honour, are nevertheless Contemned.</p>

<p>Longing mightily, and soon satisfied.</p>
<p>Apt to anger, and in their anger violent: and ready to execute their anger with their hands.</p>
<p>Lovers of Honour and of Victory more than Money, as having not been yet in Want.</p>
<p>Well natured, as having not been acquainted with much malice.</p>
<p>Full of hope, both because they have not yet been often frustrated, and because they have by natural heat that disposition that other Ages have by Wine; Youth being a kind of natural drunkenness. Besides, hope is of the time to come, whereof Youth bath much, but of the time past little.</p>
<p>Credulous, because not yet often deceived.</p>
<p>Easily deceived, because full of hope.</p>
<p>Valiant, because apt to Anger and full of hope; whereof this begets confidence, the other keeps off Fear.</p>
<p>Bashful, because they estimate the Honour of Action by the precepts of the Law.</p>
<p>Magnanimous, because not yet dejected by the misfortunes of human life.</p>
<p>And lovers of Honour more than Profit, because they live more by Custom than by Reason; and by Reason we acquire Profit, but Vertue by Custom.</p>
<p>Lovers of their Friends and Companions.</p>
<p>Apt to err in the excess, rather than the defect, contrary to that precept of Chilon, Ne quid nimis; for they overdo every thing: they Love too much, and Hate too much, because thinking themselves wise, they are obstinate in the opinion they have once delivered.</p>
<p>Doers of Injury rather for contumely than for Dammage.</p>
<p>Mercifull, because measuring others by their own innocence, they think them better than they be, and therefore less to merit what they suffer ; which is a cause of Pity.</p>

<title type="sub">Of the Manners of Old Men.</title>

<p>THE Manners of Old Men are in a manner the contraries of those of Youth.</p>
<p>They determine nothing: they do every thing less vehemently than is fit: they never say they know; but to every thing they say, perhaps, and peradventure; which comes to pass from that having lived long, they have often mistaken and been deceived.</p>
<p>They are peevish because they interpret every thing to the worst.</p>
<p>And suspicious through Incredulity, and incredulous by reason of their Experience.</p>
<p>They love and hate, as if they meant to continue in neither.</p>
<p>Are of poor spirits, as having been humbled by the chances of life.</p>
<p>And covetous, as knowing how easie 'tis to lose, and hard to get.</p>
<p>And timorous, as having been cooled by years.</p>
<p>And greedy of life: for good things seem greater by the want of them.</p>
<p>And lovers of themselves out of Pusillanimity.</p>
<p>And seek Profit more than Honour, because they love themselves ; and Profit is among the goods that are not simply good, but good for ones self.</p>
<p>And without bashfulness, because they despise seeming.</p>
<p>And hope little; knowing by Experience that many times good Counsel has been followed with ill event, and because also they be timorous.</p>
<p>And live by Memory rather than Hope; for Memory is of the time past, whereof Old Men have good store.</p>
<p>And are full of Talk, because they delight in their Memory.</p>
<p>And Vehement in their anger: but not stout enough to execute it.</p>
<p>They have weak, or no desires; and thence seem Temperate.</p>
<p>They are slaves to Gain.</p>
<p>And live more by reason than Custom; because reason leads to Profit, as Custom to that which is Honourable.</p>

<p>THE Manners of Middle-aged Men, are between those of Youth, and Old Men, and therefore,</p>
<p>They neither dare, nor fear too much: but both as is fit.</p>
<p>They neither believe all; nor reject all; but judge.</p>
<p>They seek not only what is Honourable, nor only what is Profitable; but both.</p>
<p>They are neither Covetous, nor Prodigal; but in the mean.</p>
<p>They are neither easily Angry; nor yet Stupid: but between both.</p>
<p>They are Valiant, and withal Temperate.</p>
<p>And in general, whatsoever is divided in Youth, and Old Men, is compounded in Middle-age.</p>
<p>And whereof the Excess, or Defect is in Youth or Old Men; the Mediocrity is in those of the Middle-age.</p>

<p>And Effeminate; because they have wherewithal to  . minister to their Lust.</p>
<p>And Boasters of their Wealth: and speak in high terms foolishly. For Men willingly talk of what they love and admire ; and think others affect the same that they do: and the truth is, all sorts of Men submit to the Rich.</p>
<p>And think themselves worthy to command, having that by which Men attain command.</p>
<p>And in general, they have the Manners of Fortunate Fools.</p>
<p>They do Injury, with intentions not to hurt, but to disgrace; and partly also through Incontinence.</p>
<p>There is a difference between New and Antient Riches: for they that are newly come to Wealth have the same faults in a greater degree: for New Riches are a kind of rudeness and apprentiship of Riches.</p>

<p>OF the Principles both general and special from whence Proofs are to be drawn, has been already spoken.</p>
<p>Now follow the Proofs themselves which are Examples or Entliymemes.</p>
<pb n="319"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XXI.] </note> An Example is either an Example properly so called <stage>(as some Action past)</stage>: or a Similitude <stage>(which is called a Parable)</stage> : or a Fable <stage>(which contains some Action feigned)</stage>.</p>
<p>An Example properly so called, is this; Darius came not into Greece, till he had first subdued AEgypt. Xerxes also conquered AEgypt first; then afterwards crossed the Hellespont. We ought therefore to hinder the King of Persia from conquering AEgypt.</p>
<p>A Similitude, or Parable, is such as followeth: They who choose their Magistrates by Lot, are like them that choose for their Champions those on whom the Lot shall fall, rather than those who have the greatest strength; and for their Pilot, not him that hath skill; but him whose name is drawn out of the Urne.</p>
<p>A Fable is in this manner. The Horse desiring to drive out the Stag from his common pasture, took a Man to assist him, and having received into his mouth a Bridle, and a Rider upon his Back, obtained his intent, but became subject to the Man. So you of Himera, having <stage>(in hope to be revenged of your Enemies)</stage> given unto Phalaris Soveraign Authority, that is to say, taken a Bridle into your Mouths ; if you shall also give him a Guard to his Person, that is, let him get up upon your Backs, you become his slaves presently past recovery.</p>
<p>To find out Examples, that is, Actions done that may serve our purpose, is therefore hard, because not in our power.</p>
<p>But to find Fables and Similitudes, is easier; because by conversing in Philosophy, a Man may feign somewhat in nature like to the case in hand.</p>
<p>Examples, Similitudes, and Fables, where Enthymemes are wanting, may serve us in the beginning of an Oration for Inductions; otherwise are to be alledged after Enthymemes for Testimonies.</p>
<ab>
<title type="sub">CHAP. XXII.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Of a Sentence.</title>
</ab>
<p>A SENTENCE is an universal Proposition concerning those things which are to be desired or avoided, in the Actions or Passions of the common life. As,</p>
<p>A wise Man will not suffer his Children to be over-learned.</p>
<pb n="320"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> [ BOOK II. </note> And is to an Enthymeme in RhetoricA, as any Proposition is to a Syllogisme in Logick.</p>
<p>And therefore a Sentence, if the reason be rendered, becomes a Conclusion, and both together make an Enthymeme.</p>
<p>As for Example, To be over-learned, besides that it begets effeminacy, procures envy. Therefore he that's wise will not suffer his Children to be over-learned.</p>
<p>Of Sentences there be four sorts. For they either require Proofs, or not: that is, are manifest, or not.</p>
<p>Such as are manifest, are either so, as soon as they are uttered ; as,</p>
<p>Health is a great good.</p>
<p>Or as soon as they are considered; as,</p>
<p>Men used to hate whom they have hurt.</p>
<p>Such as are not manifest, are either Conclusions of Enthymemes; as,</p>
<p>He that's wise will not suffer his Children, etc.</p>
<p>Or else are Enthymematical; that is, have in themselves the force of an Enthymeme; as,</p>
<p>Mortal Men ought not to carry Immortal Anger.</p>
<p>A Sentence not Manifest, ought to be either Inferred or Confirmed.</p>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Inferred thus: ' Tis not good to be effeminately minded, nor to be envyed by ones fellow Citizens. A wise Man therefore will not have his Children over-learned.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Confirmed thus: A wise Man will not have his Children over-learned, seeing too much Learning both softens a Mans mind, and procures him envy among his fellow Citizens.</title>
</ab>
<p>If a reason be added to a manifest Sentence let it be short.</p>
<p>Sentences become not every Man; but only old Men, and such as be well versed in business. For to hear a young Man speak Sentences, is ridiculous; and to hear an ignorant Man speak Sentences, is absurd.</p>
<p>Sentences generally received, when they are for our purpose, ought not to be neglected, because they pass for truths. And yet they may be denyed, when any laudable custom, or humour may thereby be made appear in the Denyer.</p>
<pb n="321"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XXIII.] </note> The commodities of Sentences, are two.</p>
<p>One proceeding from the Vanity of the Hearer, who takes for true universally affirmed, that which he has found for true only in some particular; and therefore a Man ought to consider in every thing what opinion the Hearer holds.</p>
<p>Another is, that Sentences do discover the manners and disposition of the speaker; so that if they be esteemed good Sentences, he shall be esteemed a good Man; and if evil, an evil Man.</p>
<p>Thus much of Sentences, what they be; of how many sorts; how to be used; whom they become ; and what is their profit.</p>
<ab>
<title type="sub">CHAP. XXIIL</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Invention of Enthymemes.</title>
</ab>
<p>SEEING an Enthymeme differs from a Logical SyUogisme, in that it neither concludes out of every thing, nor out of remote Principles; the Places of it, from whence a Man may argue, ought to be certain, and determinate.</p>
<p>And because whosoever makes a Syllogisme Rhetorical, or other, should know all, or the most part of that which is in question; as, whosoever is to advise the Athenians in the question, whether they are to make War or no, must know what their Revenues be; what, and what kind of power they have: and he that will praise them, must know their acts at Salamis, Marathon, etc. It will be necessary for a good speaker to have in readiness the choicest particulars of whatsoever he foresees he may speak of.</p>
<p>He that is to speak ex tempore, must comprehend in his speech as much as he can of what is most proper in the matter in hand.</p>
<p>Proper, I call those things which are least common to others; as, he that will praise Achilles, is not to declare such things as are common both to him, and Diomedes; as that he was a Prince, and warred against the Trojans; but such things as are proper only to Achilles; as that he killed Hector and Cygnus; went to the War young, and voluntary.</p>
<p>Let this therefore be one general Place, from that which is proper.

<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Places of Enthymemes Ostensive.</title>
</ab>
<p>FORASMUCH as Enthymemes either infer truly, or seem only so to do ; and they which do infer indeed, be either Ostensive; or such as bring a man to some impossibility; we will first set down the Places of Enthymemes Ostensive.</p>
<p>An Ostensive Enthymeme is, wherein a man concludes the question from somewhat granted.</p>
<p>That Enthymeme which brings a Man to an impossibility, is an Enthymeme wherein from that which the Adversary maintaineth, we conclude that which is manifestly impossible.</p>
<p>All Places have been already set down in a manner in the precedent Propositions of Good, Evil, Just, Unjust, Honourable, and Dishonourable: namely, they have been set down as applyed to Particular Subjects, or in Concrete.</p>
<p>Here they are to be set down in another manner; namely in the Abstract or Universal.</p>
<p>The first Place then let be from Contraries, which in the Concrete or Particulars is exemplified thus. If Intemperance be hurtful, Temperance is profitable: and if Intemperance be not hurtful, neither is Temperance profitable.</p>
<p>Another Place may be from Cognomination or affinity of words: as in this Particular. If what is Just be Good; then what is justly is well: but justly to die is not well: therefore not all that is Just is Good.</p>
<p>A third from Relatives; as, This Man has justly done, therefore the other has justly suffered. But this Place sometimes deceives, for a man may suffer justly, yet not from him.</p>
<p>A fourth from Comparison, three ways.</p>
<p>From the Great to the Less: as, He has stricken his Father; and therefore this Man.</p>
<p>From the Less to the Greater: as, The Gods know not all things; much less Man.</p>
<p>From Equality: as, If Captains be not always the worse esteemed for losing a Victory; why should Sophisters?</p>
<p>Another from the Time: as Philip to the Thebans: If I had required to pass through your Country with my Army, before I had ayded you against the Phocaeans, there is no
<pb n="323"/>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XXIV.] </note>
doubt but you would have promised it me. It is absurd therefore to deny it me now, after I have trusted you.</p>
<p>A sixth from what the Adversary says of himself: as, Iphicrates asked Aristophon, whether he would take a Bribe to betray the Army; and he answering no; What <stage>(say he)</stage> is it likely that Iphicrates would betray the Army; and Aristophon not?</p>
<p>This Place would be ridiculous, where the Defendant were not in much more estimation than the Accuser.</p>
<p>A seventh from the Definition; as that of Socrates; a Spirit is either God, or the Creature of God: and therefore he denies not Chat there is a God, that confesses there are Spirits.</p>
<p>An eighth from the distinction of an ambiguous word.</p>
<p>A ninth from Division : as, If all Men do what they do for one of three causes, whereof two are impossible; and the Accuser charge not the Defendant with the third; it follows that he has not done it.</p>
<p>A tenth from Induction : as, At Athens, at Thebes, at Sparta, etc. And therefore every where.</p>
<p>An eleventh from Authority, or precedent sentence ; as that of Sappho, that Death is evil, for that the Gods have judged it so, in exempting themselves from mortality.</p>
<p>A twelfth from the Consequence: as, <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Τι</foreign>s not good to be envied; therefore neither to be learned. ' Tis good to be wise, therefore also to be instructed.</p>
<p>A thirteenth from two contrary Consequences ; as,' Tis not good to be an Orator, because if he speak the truth, he shall displease Men: If he speak falsely, he shall displease God.</p>
<p>Here is to be noted, that sometimes this argument may be retorted : as thus, If you speak truth, you shall please God; if you speak untruth, you shall please men: therefore by all means be an Orator.</p>
<p>A Fourteenth from the quality that Men have to praise one thing, and approve another: as, We ought not to war against the Athenians upon no precedent injury ; for all Men discommend injustice. Again, We ought to war against the Athenians; for otherwise our Liberty is at their mercy, that is, is no Liberty; but the preservation of Liberty is a thing that all Men will approve.</p>
<p>A Fifteenth from Proportion: as, seeing we naturalize

strangers for their vertues, why should we not banish this stranger for his vices ?</p>
<p>A Sixteenth from the similitude of Consequents: as, He that denies the immortality of the Gods, is no worse than he that has written the generation of the Gods. For the same Consequence follows of both, that sometimes there are none.</p>
<p>A Seventeenth from that, that Men change their mind: as, If when we were in Banishment, we fought to recover our Country, why should we not fight now to retain it ?</p>
<p>An Eighteenth from a fained end: as, that Diomedes chose Ulysses to go with him, not as more valiant than another; but as one that would partake less of the Glory.</p>
<p>A Nineteenth from the Cause; as if he would infer he did it from this, that he had Cause to do it.</p>
<p>A Twentieth from that which is Incredible, but True: as, that Laws may need a Law to mend them; as well as Fish bred in the salt Water, may need salting.</p>

<title type="sub">Of the Places of Enthymemes that lead to Impossibility.</title>

<p>LET the first Place be from inspection of Times, Actions, or Words, either of the Adversary, or of the Speaker, or both. Of the Adversary; as, He says, he loves the People, and yet he was in the Conspiracy of the Thirty. Of the Speaker; as, He says, I am contentious, and yet I never began Suit. Of both ; as, He never conferred any thing to the benefit of the Commonwealth, whereas I have ransomed divers Citizens with mine own Money.</p>
<p>A Second, from shewing the cause of that which seemed amiss, and serves for Men of good reputation that are accused ; as, The Mother that was accused of Incest for being seen embracing her Son, was absolved as soon as she made appear, that she embraced him upon his arrival from far, by way of Salutation.</p>
<p>A Third, from rend ring of the cause; as, Leodamas, to whom it was objected, that he had, under the Thirty Tyrants, defaced the Inscription <stage>(which the People had set up in a Pillar)</stage> of his Ignominy; answered, He had not done it; because it would have been more to his commodity to let it stand ;

thereby to indear himself to. the Tyrants, by the Testimony of the Peoples hatred.</p>
<p>A Fourth, from better Counsel; as, He might have done better for himself; therefore he did not this. But this Place deceives, when the better Counsel comes to mind after the Fact.</p>
<p>A Fifth, from Incompatibility of the things to be done; as, They that did deliberate whether they should both mourn and sacrifice at the Funeral of Leucothea, were told, that if they thought her a Goddess, they ought not to Mourn; and if they thought her a Mortal, they ought not to Sacrifice,</p>

<p>OF seeming Enthymemes, one Place may be from the Form of speaking; as when a Man has repeated divers Sentences, he brings in his Conclusion, as if it followed necessarily, though it do not.</p>
<p>A Second from an ambiguous word.</p>
<p>A Third from that which is true divided, to that which is false joyned; as that of Orestes, It was justice that I should revenge my Fathers death, and it was justice my Mother should die for killing my Father, therefore I justly killed my Mother.

divided; as, one cup of Wine, and one cup of Wine, are hurtful; therefore'one cup of Wine is hurtful.</p>
<p>A Fourth from Amplification of the Crime. For neither is the Defendant likely to have committed the Crime he amplifies; nor does the Accuser seem, when he is passionate, to want ground for his Accusation.</p>
<p>A Fifth from signs; as. when a Man concludes the doing of the Fact from the manner of his life.</p>
<p>A Sixth from that which comes by chance, as if from this, that the Tyranny of Hipparchus came to be overthrown from the love of Aristogeiton to Harmodius, a Man should conclude, that in a free Common-wealth loving of Boys were profitable.</p>
<p>A Seventh from the Consequence, as Banishment is to be desired, because a banished Man has choice of places to dwell in.</p>
<p>An Eighth from making that the cause which is not; as, In Demosthenes his Government, the War began; therefore Demosthenes governed well. With the Pelponnesian War began the Plague, therefore Pericles that perswaded that War, did ill.</p>
<p>A Ninth from the Omission of some circumstance, as, Helen did what was lawful, when sAe ran away with Paris, because sAe had her Father's consent to choose her own Husband; which was true only during the time that she had not chosen.</p>
<p>A Tenth, from that which is probable in some case, to that which is probable simply; as, <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Τι</foreign>s probable, he foresaw, that if he did it, he should be suspected; therefore His probable he did it not.</p>
<p>From this Place one may infer both ways that he did it not. For if he be not likely to do it, it may be thought he did it not, again, if he were likely to do it, it may be thought he did it not, for this, that he knew he should be suspected.</p>
<p>Upon this Place was grounded the Art, which was so much detested in Protagoras, of making the better cause seem the worse; and the worse the better.</p>

<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Wage, to answer the Arguments of the Adversary.</title>
</ab>
<p>AN Argument is answered by an opposite Syllogisme, or by an Objection.</p>
<p>The Places of opposite Syllogismes are the same with the Places of Syllogismes, or Enthymemes: for a Rhetorical Syllogisme is an Enthymeme.</p>
<p>The Places of Objections are four.</p>
<p>First, from the same, as, To the Adversary that proves love to be good by an Enthymeme, may be objected, that no want is good, and yet Love is want; or particularly thus: The Love of Myrrha to her Father was not good.</p>
<p>The Second from Contraries: as, if the Adversary say, A good Man does good to his friends, an Objection might be made, that then an evil Man will do also evil to his friends.</p>
<p>The Third from Similitude: as thus, if the Adversary say, all Men that are injured, do hate those that have injured them, it may be objected, that then, all Men that had received Benefits should love their Benefactors, that is to say, be grateful.</p>
<p>The Fourth from the authority of famous men; as when a Man shall say, that drunken Men ought to be pardoned those Acts they do in their drunkenness, because they know not what they do; the Objection may be, that Pittacus was of another mind, that appointed for such Acts a double punishment; one for the Act, another for the Drunkenness.</p>
<p>And forasmuch as all Enthymemes are drawn from Probability, or Example, or from a Sign Fallible, or from a Sign Infallible: an Enthymeme from Probability may be confuted really, by shewing that for the most part it falls out otherwise ; but apparently or sophistically, by shewing only that it does not fall out so alwayes; whereupon the Judge thinks the Probability not sufficient to ground his Sentence upon.</p>
<p>[The Reason whereof is this, That the Judge, while he hears the Fact proved probable, conceives it as true. For the Understanding has no Object but Truth. And therefore by and by, when he shall hear an Instance to the contrary; and thereby find that he had no necessity to think it true, presently changes his opinion, and thinks it false, and consequently not so much as probable. For
<pb n="328"/>

<note type="margin"> [ BOOK II. </note>
he cannot at one time think the same thing both probable and false: and he that says a thing is probable, the meaning is, he thinks it true, but finds not arguments enough to prove it.]</p>
<p>An Enthymeme from a fallible sign, is answered, by shewing the sign to be fallible.</p>
<p>An Enthymeme from an Example, is answered, as an Enthymeme from Probability; really, by shewing more Examples to the contrary; apparently, if he bring Examples enough to make it seem not necessary.</p>
<p>If the Adversary have more Examples than we, we must make appear that they are not applycable to the Case.</p>
<p>An Enthymeme from an infallible sign, if the Proposition be true, is unanswerable.</p>
<ab>
<title type="sub">CHAP. XXVIII.</title>
</ab>
<p>Amplification and Extenuation are not Common Places. Enthymemes by which Arguments are answered, are the same with those by which the Matter in question is proved, or disproved. Objections are not Enthymeme8.</p>
<p>THE first, that Amplification and Extenuation are not Common Places, appears by this, that Amplification and Extenuation do prove a fact to be great, or little; and are therefore Enthymemes, to be drawn from Common Places, and therefore are not the Places themselves.</p>
<p>The second, that Enthymemes, by which Arguments are answered, are of the same kind with those by which the matter in question is proved, is manifest by this, that these infer the opposite of what was proved by the other.</p>
<p>The third, that an Objection is no Enthymeme, is apparent by this, that an Objection is no more but an Opinion, Example, or other Instance, produced to make appear, that the Adversaries Argument does not conclude.</p>
<p>Thus much of Examples, Sentences, Enthymemes, and generally of all things that belong to Argumentation; from what Places they may be drawn, or answered.</p>

<title type="sub">Of the Original of Elocution and Pronuntiation.</title>
</ab>
<p>THREE things being necessary to an Oration, namely, Proof, Elocution, and Disposition; we have done with the first, and shall speak of the other two in that which follows.</p>
<p>As for Action, or Pronuntiation, so much as is necessary for an Orator, may be fetcht out of the Book of the Art of Poetry, in which we have treated of the Action of the Stage.</p>
<p>For Tragedians were the first that invented such Action, and that but of late ; and it consisteth in governing well the magnitude, tone, and measure of the Voice; a thing less subject to Art, than is either Proof, or Elocution.</p>
<p>And yet there have been Rules delivered concerning it, as far forth as serve for Poetry.</p>
<p>But Oratorical Action has not been hitherto reduced to Art.</p>
<p>And Orators in the beginning, when they saw that the Poets in barren and feigned Arguments, nevertheless attained great Reputation ; supposing it had proceeded from the choice, or connexion of words, fell into a Stile, by imitation of them, approaching to Verse, and made choice of words.</p>
<p>But when the Poets changed their Stile, and laid by all words that were not in common use, the Orators did the same, and lighted at last upon words, and a Government of the Voice and Measures proper to themselves.</p>
<p>Seeing therefore Pronuntiation, or Action are in some degree necessary also for an Orator, the Precepts thereof are to be fetcht from the Art of Poetry.</p>
<p>[In the mean time this may be one general rule. If the Words, Tone, Greatness of the Voice, Gesture of the Body and Countenance, seem to proceed all from one Passion, then 'tis well pronounced. Otherwise not.

<title type="sub">CHAP. II.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Choice of Words and Epithets.</title>
</ab>
<p>THE Vertues of a Word are two ; the first, that it be perspicuous; the second, that it be decent; that is, neither above, nor below the thing signified ; or, neither too humble, nor too fine.</p>
<p>Perspicuous are all Words that be Proper.</p>
<p>Fine Words are those, that are borrowed, or Translated from other significations; of which in the Art of Poetry.</p>
<p>The reason why borrowed Words please, is this. Men are affected with Words, as they are with Men, admiring in both that which is Forraign and New.</p>
<p>To make a Poem graceful, many things help; but few an Oration.</p>
<p>For to a Poet it sufficeth with what Words he can set out his Poem: but an Orator must not only do that; but also seem not to do it: for else he will be thought to speak unnaturally, and not as he thinks ; and thereby be the less believed; whereas belief is the scope of his Oration.</p>
<p>The Words that an Orator ought to use are of three sorts. Proper ; such as are Received; and Metaphors.</p>
<p>Words taken from Forraign Languages, Words compounded, and Words new coyned, are seldom to be used.</p>
<p>Synonimaes belong to Poets, and Equivocal Words to Sophisters.</p>
<p>An Orator, if he use Proper Words, and Received, and good Metaphors, shall both make his Oration beautiful, and not seem to intend it; and shall speak perspicuously. For in a Metaphor alone there is Perspicuity, Novity, and Sweetness.</p>
<p>Concerning Metaphors the Rules are these. 1. He that will make the best of a thing, let him draw his Metaphor from somewhat that is better. As for Example, let him call a Crime, an Error. On the other side, when he would make the worst of it, let him draw his Metaphor from somewhat worse, as, calling Error, Crime.</p>
<pb n="331"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. III.] </note> 2. A Metaphor ought not to be so far fetcht, as that the Similitude may not easily appear.</p>
<p>3. A Metaphor ought to be drawn from the noblest things, as the Poets do that choose rather to say, Rosy-fingered, than Red-fingered Aurora.</p>
<p>In like manner the Rule of Epithets is, That he that will adorn, should use those of the better sort; and he that will disgrace, should use those of the worse: as Simonides being to Write an Ode in honour of the Victory gotten in a Course by certain Mules, being not well paid, called them by their name [<foreign xml:lang="grc">῾Ημιόνους</foreign>] that signifies their propinquity to Asses: but having received a greater reward, stiles them the Sons of swift-footed Coursers.</p>

<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Things that make an Oration Flat.</title>
</ab>
<p>THE things that make an Oration flat or insipide, are four.</p>
<p>1. Words Compounded; [and yet a Man may Compound a word, when the Composition is necessary, for want of a simple word; and easie, and seldom used.]</p>
<p>2. Forraign Words. As for Example, such as are newly derived from the Latine; which though they were proper among them whose tongue it is, are Forraign in another Language : and yet these may be used, so it be moderately.</p>
<p>3. Long, impertinent, and often Epithets.</p>
<p>4. Metaphors, indecent, and obscure. Obscure they are, when they are far fetcht. Indecent when they are ridiculous, as in Comedies ; or too grave, as in Tragedies.</p>

<ab>
<title type="sub">Of a Similitude.</title>
</ab>
<p>A SIMILITUDE differs from a Metaphor only by such Particks of Comparison as these, As; Even as ; So; Even so, etc.</p>
<p>A Similitude therefore is a Metaphor dilated; and a Metaphor is a Similitude Contracted into one Word.</p>
<p>A Similitude does well in an Oration, so it be not too frequent ; for 'tis Poetical.</p>
<pb n="332"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> An Example of a Similitude, is this of Pericles; that said in his Oration, that the Baeotians were like to so many Oaks in a Wood, that did nothing but beat one another.</p>

<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Purity of Language.</title>
</ab>
<p>FOUR things are necessary to make Language Pure.</p>
<p>1. The right rendring of those Particles which some antecedent Particle does require: as to a Not only, a Not also ; and then they are rendered right, when they are not suspended too long.</p>
<p>2. The use of proper Words, rather than Circumlocutions, unless there be motive to make one do it of purpose.</p>
<p>3. That there be nothing of double construction, unless there be cause to do it of purpose. As the Prophets <stage>(of the Heathen)</stage> who speak in general terms, to the end they may the better maintain the truth of their Prophesies ; which is easier maintained in generals, than in particulars. For 'tis easier to divine, whether a number be even or odd, than how many; and that a thing will be, than what it will be.</p>
<p>4. Concordance of Gender, Number, and Person; as not to say Him for Her; Man for Men ; Hath for Have.</p>
<p>In Summ; a Man's Language ought to be easie for another to read, pronounce, and point.</p>
<p>Besides, to divers Antecedents, let divers Relatives, or one common to them all, be correspondent: as, He saw the Colour; He heard the Sound; or He perceived both Colour and Sound; but by no means, He heard or saw both.</p>
<p>Lastly, that which is to be interposed by Parenthesis, let it be done quickly: as, I purposed, having spoken to him <stage>(to this, and this purpose)</stage> afterward to be gone. For to put it off thus: I resolved, after I had spoken to him, to be gone ; but the subject of my speech was to this and this purpose, is vitious.</p>

</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Convenience or Decency of Elocution.</title>
</ab>
<p>ELOCUTIONS are made Decent,</p>
<p>1. By speaking feelingly; that is, with such Passion as is fit for the matter he is in; as Angerly in matter of Injury.</p>
<p>2. By speaking as becomes the Person of the Speaker; as for a Gentleman to speak eruditely.</p>
<p>3. By speaking proportionably to the matter ; as of great affairs to speak in a high ; and of mean, in a low Stile.</p>
<p>4. By abstaining from Compounded, and from Outlandish words; unless a Man speak passionately, and have already moved, and, as it were, inebriated his Hearers. Or Ironically.</p>
<p>It confers also to perswasion very much, to use these ordinary Forms of speaking, All men know; <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Τι</foreign>s confessed by all; No Man will deny, and the like. For the Hearer consents, surprized with the fear to be esteemed the only Ignorant Man.</p>
<p>'Tis good also, having used a word that signifies more than the matter requires, to abstain from the Pronunciation and Countenance that to such a word belongs: that the Disproportion between it and the matter may the less appear. And when a Man has said too much, it will shew well to correct himself: for he will get belief by seeming to consider what he says.</p>
<p>[But in this a Man must have a care not to be too precise in shewing of this Consideration. For the ostentation of Carefulness is an argument oftentimes of lying; as may be observed in such as tell particularities not easily observed, when they would be thought to speak more precise truth than is required.]</p>

<title type="sub">Of two Sorts of Stiles.</title>
</ab>
<p>THERE be two sorts of Stiles.</p>
<p>The one continued or to be comprehended at once; the other divided, or distinguished by Periods.</p>
<p>The first sort was in use with antient Writers: but is now out of date.</p>
<p>An Example of this Stile is in the History of Herodotus; wherein there is no Period till the end of the whole History.</p>
<p>In the other kind of Stile, that is distinguished by Periods ; a Period is such a part as is perfect in it self, and has such length as may easily be comprehended by the understanding.</p>
<p>This later kind is pleasant; the former unpleasant, because this appears finite, the other infinite: in this the Hearer has always somewhat set out, and terminated to him; in the other he fore-sees no end, and has nothing finished to him; this may easily be committed to memory, because of the measure and cadence <stage>(which is the cause that Verses be easily remembered)</stage> ; the other not.</p>
<p>Every Sentence ought to end with the period, and nothing to be interposed.</p>
<p>Period is either simple, or divided into Parts.</p>
<p>Simple is that which is Indivisible; as, I wonder you fear not their ends, whose actions you imitate.</p>
<p>A Period divided, is that which not only has perfection and length convenient, for respiration, but also Parts. As, I wonder you are not afraid of their ends, seeing you imitate their actions: where in these words, I wonder you are not afraid of their ends, is one Colon, or Part; and in these, Seeing you imitate their actions, another: and both together make the Period.</p>
<p>The parts, or members, and periods of speech ought neither to be too long, nor too short.</p>
<p>Too long are they, which are produced beyond the expectation of the Hearer.</p>
<p>Too short are they, that end before he expects it.

<note type="margin"> CHAP. IX.] </note> Those that be too long, leave the Hearer behind, like him that walking, goes beyond the usual end of the Walk, and thereby out-goes him that walks with him.</p>
<p>They that be too short, make the Hearer stumble; for when he looks far before him, the end stops him before he be aware.</p>
<p>A period that is divided into parts, is either divided only; or has also an Opposition of the Parts one to another.</p>
<p>Divided only is such as this: This the Senate knows; the Consul sees; and yet the Man lives.</p>
<p>A Period with Opposition of Parts, called also Antithesis, and the parts Antitheta, is when contrary parts are put together ; or also joyned by a third.</p>
<p>Contrary parts are put together, as here, The one has obtained Glory, the other Riches; both by my benefit.</p>
<p>Antitheta are therefore acceptable; because not only the parts appear the better for the opposition; but also for that they carry with them a certain appearance of that kind of Enthymeme, which leads to Impossibility.</p>
<p>Parts, or Members of a Period, are said to be equal, when they have altogether, or almost equal Number of Syllables.</p>
<p>Parts, or Members of a Period, are said to be like, when they begin, or end alike: and the more Similitudes, and the greater equality there is of Syllables, the more graceful is the Period.</p>

<title type="sub">Of those Things that grace an Oration, and make it delightful.</title>
</ab>
<p>FORASMUCH as there is nothing more delightful to a Man, than to find that he apprehends and learns easily ; it necessarily follows, that those Words are most grateful to the Ear, that make a Man seem to see before his Eyes the things signified.</p>
<p>And therefore Forraign Words are unpleasant, because Obscure; and Plain Words, because too Manifest, making us learn nothing new: but Metaphors please; for they beget in us by the Genus, or some common thing to that with another, a kind of Science: as when an Old Man is called Stubble; a Man suddenly learns that he grows up, flourisheth, and
<pb n="336"/>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note>
withers like Grass, being put in mind of it by the qualities common to Stubble, and to Old Men.</p>
<p>That which a Metaphor does, a Similitude does the same; but with less grace, because with more prolixity.</p>
<p>Such Enthymemes are the most graceful, which neither are presently very Manifest, nor yet very hard to be understood 1, but are comprehended, while they are uttering, or presently after, though not understood before.</p>
<p>The things that make a speech graceful, are these; Antitheta, Metaphors, and Animation.</p>
<p>Of Antitheta and Antithesis hath been spoken in the precedent Chapter.</p>
<p>Of Metaphors the most graceful is that which is drawn from Proportion.</p>
<p>[Aristotle <stage>(in the 12 Chapter of his Poetry)</stage> defines a Metaphor to be the translation of a name from one signification to another ; whereof he makes four kinds: 1. From the General to the Particular. 2. From the Particular to the General. 3. From one Particular to another. 4. From Proportion.</p>
<p>A Metaphor from Proportion is such as this, A State without Youth, is a Year without a Spring.</p>
<p>Animation is that expression which makes us seem to see the thing before our eyes; as he that said, The Athenians poured out their City into Sicily, meaning, they sent thither the greatest Army they could make; and this is the greatest grace of an Oration.</p>
<p>If therefore in the same Sentence there concur both Metaphor, and this Animation, and also Antithesis, it cannot choose but be very graceful.</p>
<p>That an Oration is graced by Metaphor, Animation, and Antithesis, hath been said: but how 'tis graced, is to be said in the next Chapter.</p>

<p>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. X.] </note> </p>
<p>Such Metaphors as these come into a Mans mind by the observation of things that have similitude and proportion one to another. And the more unlike and unproportionable the things be otherwise, the more grace bath the Metaphor.</p>
<p>A Metaphor without Animation, adds grace then, when the Hearer finds he learns somewhat by such use of the word.</p>
<p>Also Paradoxes are graceful, so Men inwardly do believe them: for they have in them somewhat like to those jests that are grounded upon the similitude of words, which have usually one sense, and in the present another; and somewhat like to those jests which are grounded upon the deceiving of a Mans expectation.</p>
<p>And Paragrams; that is, allusions of words are graceful, if they be well placed; and in Periods not too long ; and with Antithesis; for by these means the ambiguity is taken away.</p>
<p>And the more of these; namely, Metaphor, Animation, Antithesis, Equality of Members, a Period hath, the more graceful it is.</p>
<p>Similitudes grace an Oration, when they contain also a Metaphor.</p>
<p>And Proverbs are graceful, because they are Metaphors, or Translations of words from one species to another.</p>
<p>And Hyperboles, because they also are Metaphors: but they are youthful, and bewray vehemence; and are used with most grace by them that are angry; and for that cause are not comely in Old Men.</p>

<title type="sub">Of the Difference between the Stile to be used in Writing, and the Stile to be used in Pleading.</title>
</ab>
<p>THE Stile that should be Read ought to be more exact and accurate.</p>
<p>But the Stile of a Pleader ought to be suited to Action and Pronuntiation.</p>
<p>Orations of them that Plead, pass away with the hearing.</p>
<p>But those that are Written, Men carry about them, and are considered at leisure; and consequently must endure to be sifted and examined.</p>
<p>Written Orations appear flat in Pleading.

<note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> And Orations made for the Barr, when the Action is away, appear in Reading insipide.</p>
<p>In Written Orations Repetition is justly condemned.</p>
<p>But in Pleadings, by the help of Action, and by some change in the Pleader, Repetition becomes Amplification.</p>
<p>In Written Orations Disjunctives do ill; as, I came, If found Aim, I asked him: for they seem superfluous, and but one thing, because they are not distinguished by Action.</p>
<p>But in Pleadings 'tis Amplification; because that which is but one thing, is made to seem many.</p>
<p>Of Pleadings, that which is Judicial ought to be more accurate, than that which is before the people.</p>
<p>And an Oration to the people ought to be more accommodate to Action, than a Judicial.</p>
<p>And of Judicial Orations, that ought to be more accurate, which is uttered to few Judges ; and that ought to be more accommodate to Action, which is uttered to many. As in a Picture, the farther he stands off that beholds it, the less need there is that the Colours be fine: so in Orations, the farther the Hearer stands off, the less need there is for his Oration to be elegant.</p>
<p>Therefore Demonstrative Orations are most proper for Writing, the end whereof is to Read.</p>

<title type="sub">Of the Parts of an Oration, and their Order.</title>
</ab>
<p>THE necessary Parts of an Oration are but two; Propositions, and Proof; which are as it were the Probleme, and Demonstration.</p>
<p>The Proposition is the explication, or opening of the Matter to be proved.</p>
<p>And Proof is the Demonstration of the Matter propounded.</p>
<p>To these necessary parts, are sometimes added two other, the Proeme and the Epilogue, neither of which are any Proof.</p>
<p>So that in some there be four parts of an Oration; the Proeme, the Proposition, or <stage>(as the others call it)</stage> the Narration, the Proofs, <stage>(which contain Confirmation, Confutation, Amplification, and Diminution,)</stage> and the Epilogue.</p>

<title type="sub">CHAP. XIII.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Proeme.</title>
</ab>
<p>THE Proeme is the beginning of an Oration, and, as it were, the preparing of the way before one enter into it.</p>
<p>In some kinds of Orations it resembles the Prelude of Musicians, who first play what they list, and afterwards the Tune they intended.</p>
<p>In other kinds it resembles the Prologue of a Play, that contains the Argument.</p>
<p>Proemes of the first sort, are most proper for Demonstrative Orations; in which a Man is free to foretell, or not, what points he will insist upon; and for the most part 'tis better not: because when a Man has not obliged himself to a certain matter, Digression will seem Variety: but if he have in gaged himself, Variety will be accounted Digression.</p>
<p>In Demonstratives the matter of the Proeme consisteth in the Praise or Dispraise of some Law or Custom, or in Exhortation, or Dehortation ; or something that serves to incline the Hearer to the purpose.</p>
<p>Proemes of the second kind are most proper for Judicial Orations. For as the Prologue in a Dramatick, and the Exordium in an Epique Poem, setteth first in few words the Argument of the Poem: so in a Judicial Oration the Orator ought to exhibit a Model of his Oration, that the mind of the Hearer may not be suspended, and for want of fore-sight, err or wander.</p>
<p>Whatsoever else belongs to a Proeme, is drawn from one of these four; From the Speaker, From the Adversary, From the Hearer, or from the Matter.</p>
<p>From the Speaker and Adversary are drawn into Proemes such Criminations and Purgations as belong not to the cause.</p>
<p>To the Defendant 'tis necessary in the Proeme to answer to the accusations of his Adversary; that those being cleared, he may have a more favourable entrance to the rest of his Oration.</p>
<p>But to the Plaintife 'tis better to cast his Criminations all into the Epilogue, that the Judge may the more easily remember them.</p>
<p>From the Hearer and from the Matter are drawn into the Proeme such things as serve to make the Hearer favourable, or angry; attentive, or not attentive, as need shall require.

<note type="footnote"> z 2 </note></p>
<pb n="340"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK in. </note> And Hearers use to be attentive to persons that are reputed good; to things that are of great Consequence, or that concern themselves, or that are strange, or that delight.</p>
<p>But to make the Hearer attentive, is not the part of the Proeme only, but of any other part of the Oration, and rather of any other part, than of the Proeme. For the Hearer is every where more remiss than in the beginning. And therefore wheresoever there is need, the Orator must make appear both the probity of his own person, and that the matter in hand is of great Consequence; or that it concerns the Hearer; or that it is new; or that it is delightful.</p>
<p>He that will have the Hearer attentive to him, but not to the Cause, must on the other side make it seem that the matter is a trifle, without relation to the Hearer, common, and tedious.</p>
<p>That the Hearer may be favourable to the Speaker, one of two things is required; that he love him, or that he pity him.</p>
<p>In Demonstrative Orations, he that praises shall have the Hearer favourable if he think himself, or his own manners, or course of life, or any thing he loves, comprehended in the same praise.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he that dispraises, shall be heard favourably, if the Hearer find his Enemies, or their courses, or any thing he hates, involved in the same dispraise.</p>
<p>The Proeme of a Deliberative Oration is taken from the same things, from which are taken the Proemes of Judicial Orations. For the matter of a Deliberative Oration needeth not that natural Proeme, by which is shewn what we are to speak of; for that is already known: the Proeme in these, being made only for the Speakers, or Adversaries sake; or to make the Matter appear great, or little, as one would have it, and is therefore to be taken from the persons of the Plaintif or Defendant; or from the Hearer, or from the Matter, as in Orations Judicial.</p>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XIV.] </note>
or not to him, or not so much, or not unjust, or not great, or not dishonourable.</p>
<p>3. A third from the Recompence, as, I did him harm, but withal I did him honour.</p>
<p>4. A fourth from the Excuse; as, It was Errour, Mischance, or Constraint.</p>
<p>5. A fifth from the Intention; as, One thing was done, another meant.</p>
<p>6. A sixth from the Comprehension of the Accuser; as, What I have done, the Accuser has done the same; or his Father, Kinsman, or Friend.</p>
<p>7. From the Comprehension of those that are in Reputation; as, What I did, such and such have done the same, who nevertheless are good Men.</p>
<p>8. From Comparison with such as have been falsely accused, or wrongfully suspected, and nevertheless found upright.</p>
<p>9. From Recrimination; as, The Accuser is a man of ill life, and therefore not to be believed.</p>
<p>10. From that the Judgment belongs to another Place, or Time ; as, I have already answered, or am to answer elsewhere to this Matter.</p>
<p>11. From Crimination of the Crimination; as, It serves only to pervert Judgment.</p>
<p>12. A twelfth, which is common both to Crimination and Purgation, and is taken from some sign ; as Teucer is not to be believed, because his Mother was Priam's Sister. On the other side, Teucer is to be believed, because his Father was Priam's Enemy.</p>
<p>13. A thirteenth, proper to Crimination only, from praise and dispraise mixt: as, To praise small things, and blame great ones; or to praise in many words, and blame with effectual ones; or to praise many things that are good, and then add one evil, but a great one.</p>
<p>14. A fourteenth, coming both to Crimination and Purgation, is taken from the interpretation of the fact: for he that purgeth himself interpreteth the fact always in the best sense; and he that Criminates, always in the worst; as when Ulysses said, Diomedes chose him for his Companion, as the most able of the Grecians, to aid him in his exploit: but his Adversary said, He chose him for his cowardice, as the most unlikely to share with him in the Honour.</p>

<title type="sub">CHAP. XV.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Narration.</title>
</ab>
<p>THE Narration is not always continued and of one Piece; but sometimes, as in Demonstratives, interrupted, and dispersed through the whole Oration.</p>
<p>For there being in a Narration something that falls not under Art; as namely, the Actions themselves, which the Orator inventeth not; he must therefore bring in the Narration of them where he best may. As for Example, if being to praise a Man, you would make a Narration of all his Acts immediately from the beginning, and without interruption, you will find it necessary afterwards to repeat the same Acts again, while from some of them you praise his Valour, and from others his Wisdom: whereby your Oration shall have less variety, and shall less please.</p>
<p>'Tis not necessary always that the Narration be short. The true measure of it must be taken from the matter that is to be laid open.</p>
<p>In the Narration, as oft as may be, 'tis good to insert somewhat commendable in ones self, and blameable in ones Adversary : As, I advised him but he would take no Counsel.</p>
<p>In Narrations, a Man is to leave out whatsoever breeds compassion, indignation in the Hearer besides the purpose; as Ulysses in Homer, relating his Travels to Alcinous, to move compassion in him, is so long in it, that it consists of divers Books: but when he comes home, tells the same to his Wife in thirty Verses, leaving out what might make her sad.</p>
<p>The Narration ought also to be in such words as argue the Manners; that is, some virtuous or vicious habit in him of whom we speak, although it be not exprest; As, setting his Arms a kenbold, he answered, etc. by which is insinuated the pride of him that so answered.</p>
<p>In an Oration a Man does better to shew his affection than his Judgment: that is, 'Tis better to say, I like this; than to say, This is better. For by the one you would seem wise, by the other good. But Favour follows Goodness; whereas Wisdom procures Envy.</p>
<p>But if this Affection seem incredible, then either a reason
<pb n="343"/>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XV.] </note>
must be rendered, as did Antigone. For when she had said, SAe loved her brother better than her Husband or Children ; she added, for Husband and Children I may have more; but another Brother I cannot, my Parents being both dead. Or else a man must use this form of speaking; I know this affection of mine seems strange to you; but nevertheless it is such. For 'tis not easily believed, that any Man has a mind to do any thing that is not for his own good.</p>
<p>Besides in a Narration, not only the Actions themselves; but the Passions, and signs that accompany them, are to be discovered.</p>
<p>And in his Narration a Man should make himself and his Adversary be considered for such, and such, as soon, and as covertly as he can.</p>
<p>A Narration may have need sometimes not to be in the beginning.</p>
<p>In Deliberative Orations; that is, where soever the question is of things to come ; a Narration, which is always of things past, has no place: and yet things past may be recounted, that Men may deliberate better of the future: But that is not as Narration, but Proof; for 'tis Example.</p>
<p>There may also be Narration in Deliberatives in that part where Crimination and Praise come in: But that part is not Deliberative, but Demonstrative.</p>
<ab>
<title type="sub">CHAP. XVI.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">Of Proof, or Confirmation, and Refutation.</title>
</ab>
<p>PROOFS are to be applyed to something controverted.</p>
<p>The Controversie in Judicial Oration is, Whether it has been done; whether it has been hurtful; whether the matter be so great, and whether it be Just, or no.</p>
<p>In a question of Fact, one of the Parties of necessity is faulty, <stage>(for ignorance of the Fact is no excuse,)</stage> and therefore the Fact is chiefly to be insisted on.</p>
<p>In Demonstratives, the Fact for the most part is supposed: but the honour and profit of the Fact are to be proved.</p>
<p>In Deliberatives, the question is, Whether the thing be like to be, or likely to be so great: or whether it be just; or whether it be profitable.</p>
<p>Besides the application of the Proof to the question, a Man
<pb n="344"/>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note>
ought to observe, whether hi a Adversary have lyed in any point without the Cause. For 'tis a sign-he does the same in the Cause.</p>
<p>The Proofs themselves are either Examples, or Enthymemes.</p>
<p>A Deliberative Oration, because 'tis. of things to come, requireth rather Examples, than Enthymemes.</p>
<p>But a Judicial Oration, being of things past, which have a necessity in them, and may be concluded syllogistically, requireth rather Enthymemes.</p>
<p>Enthymemes ought not to come too thick together, for they hinder one anothers force by confounding the Hearer.</p>
<p>Nor ought a Man to endeavour to prove every thing by Enthymeme, least like some Philosophers, he collect what is known, from what is less known.</p>
<p>Nor ought a Man to use Enthymemes, when he would move the Hearer to some affection: For seeing divers Motions do mutually destroy or weaken one another, he will lose either the Enthymeme, or the affection that he would move.</p>
<p>For the same reason, a Man ought not to use Enthymemes when he would express Manners.</p>
<p>But whether he would move affection, or insinuate his Manners, he may withal use Sentences.</p>
<p>A Deliberative Oration is more difficult than a Judicial, because 'tis of thefuture, whereas a Judicial is of that which is past, and that consequently may be known; and because it has principles, namely the Law; and it is easier to prove from principles, than without.</p>
<p>Besides, a Deliberative Oration wants those helps of turning to the Adversary ; of speaking of himself; of raising passion.</p>
<p>He therefore that wants matter in a Deliberative Oration, let him bring in some person to praise or dispraise.</p>
<p>And in Demonstratives he that has nothing to say in commendation or discommendation of the principal party, let him praise or dispraise some body else, as his Father, or Kinsman, or the very vertues or vices themselves.</p>
<p>He that wants not Proofs, let him not only prove strongly, but also insinuate his Manners: but he that has no Proof, let him nevertheless insinuate his Manners. For a good Man is as acceptable, as an exact Oration.</p>
<p>Of Proofs, those that lead to an absurdity, please better than those that are direct or ostensive ; because from the com-
<pb n="345"/>

<note type="margin"> CHAP. XVII.] </note>
parison of Contraries, namely, Truth and Falsity, the force of the Syllogisme does the better appear.</p>
<p>Confutation is also a part of Proof.</p>
<p>And he that speaks first, puts it after his own Proofs, unless the Controversie contain many and different matters. And he that speaks last, puts it before.</p>
<p>For 'tis necessary to make way for his own Oration, by removing the Objections of him that spake before. For the mind abhors both the Man, and his Oration, that is damned before hand.</p>
<p>If a Man desire his Manners should appear well, <stage>(least speaking of himself he become odious, or troublesome, or obnoxious to obtrectation; or speaking of another, he seem contumelious, or scurrilous,)</stage> let him introduce another person.</p>
<p>Last of all, least he cloy his Hearer with Enthymemes, let him vary them sometimes with Sentences; but such as have the same force. As here is an Enthymeme. If it be then the best time to make peace when the best conditions of peace may be had, then the time is now, while our Fortune is entire. And this is a Sentence of equal force to it. Wise Men make peace, while their Fortune is entire.</p>

<ab>
<title type="sub">Of Interrogations, Answers, and Jests.</title>
</ab>
<p>THE times wherein 'tis fit to ask ones Adversary a question are chiefly four.</p>
<p>1. The first is, when of two Propositions that conclude an Absurdity, he has already uttered one; and we would by Interrogation draw him to confess the other.</p>
<p>2. The second, when of two Propositions that conclude an Absurdity, one is manifest of it self, and the other likely to be fetched out by a question; then the Interrogation will be seasonable; and the absurd Conclusion is presently to be inferred, without adding that Proposition which is manifest.</p>
<p>3. The third, when a Man would make appear that his Adversary does contradict himself.</p>
<p>4. The fourth, when a Man would take from his Adversary such shifts as these, In some sort 'tis so; In some sort 'tis not so.</p>
<pb n="346"/>
<p>

<note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> Out of these Cases 'tis not fit to interrogate. For he whose question succeeds not, is thought vanquished.</p>
<p>To equivocal questions a Man ought to answer fully, and not to be too brief.</p>
<p>To Interrogations which we fore-see tend to draw from us an Answer, contrary to our purpose, we must, together with our Answer, presently give an Answer to the objection which is implyed in the Question.</p>
<p>And where the Question exacteth an Answer that concludeth against us, we must together with our Answer presently distinguish.</p>
<p>Jests are dissolved by serious and grave discourse: and grave discourse is deluded by Jests.</p>
<p>The several kinds of Jests are set down in the Art of Poetry.</p>
<p>Whereof one kind is Ironia, and tends to please ones self.</p>
<p>The other is Scurrility, and tends to please others.</p>
<p>The latter of these has in it a kind of baseness; the former may become a Man of good breeding.</p>

<ab>
<title type="sub">Of the Peroration.</title>
</ab>
<p>THE Peroration must consist of one of these four things.</p>
<p>Inclining the Judge to favour yourself, or to disfavour your Adversary. For then, when all has been said respecting the cause, is the best season to praise, or dispraise the Parties.</p>
<p>Of Amplification or Diminution. For when it appears what is good or evil, then is the time to shew how great, or how little that good or evil is.</p>
<p>Or in moving the Judge to Anger, Love, or other Passion. For when it is manifest of what kind, and how great the good or evil is, then it will be opportune to excite the Judge.</p>
<p>Or of Repetition, that the Judge may remember what has been said.</p>
<p>Repetition consisteth in the matter, and the manner. For the Orator must shew, that he has performed what he promised in the beginning of his Oration, and how: namely, by comparing his Arguments one by one with his Adversaries, repeating them in the same order they were spoken.</p>

<p>If an act of injustice has been committed, but that act of injustice has not been defined by the written law, under which species of law must he prove his case ? <stage>(chap. xiii. 14 ; xv. 4.)</stage></p>
<p>Am I then to understand, that in inquiring whether his adversary has committed an act of injustice, the orator's first business is to prove that he has acted for some end; secondly, that he was a likely person to commit it; and thirdly, that the object injured was a person likely to be injured ?</p>
<p>Are these the three general points which he must prove against his adversary ?</p>
<p>What is the specific point he must prove against his adversary ?</p>
<p>Why is the general question, Whether the adversary has committed an act of injustice, <stage>(chap. x. xi. xii.)</stage> and the specific question, Whether he has acted unjustly, <stage>(chap. xiii.)</stage> distinguished ? <stage>(vide chap. x. 7.)</stage></p>
<p>To prove that his adversary has acted unjustly against the state, or a private individual, what must the orator urge against his adversary ? <stage>(chap. xiii. 7.)</stage></p>
<p>If the act is clearly done by a voluntary agent, on what principle must the orator prove his adversary to have acted ? <stage>(chap. xiii. 7.)</stage></p>
<pb n="360"/>
<p>If the act is clearly done by deliberative choice, what is the next question an orator must prove against his adversary ? <stage>(chap. xiii. 9.)</stage></p>
<p>To prove simply that his adversary has acted unjustly, how many specific questions arise for the oratoris consideration?</p>
<p>Are they not three ? Ist. Whether he has violated the written law? <stage>(chap. xiii. 9.)</stage> 2pd. If he has not violated the written law, whether he has acted with depravity, so excessive as not to be defined by the written law ? <stage>(chap. xiii. 12.)</stage> 3rd. Whether he has acted in violation of equity ? <stage>(chap. xiii. 12,13.)</stage></p>

<p>You stated in reply to questions in the first book, that Aristotle had made three distinctions of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστεις</foreign>, viz. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ του̃ ἤθους, διὰ τω̃ν ἀκροατω̃ν, διὰ τω̃ν λόγων</foreign> : which of these three distinctions has he already treated of, and which is he now proceeding to discuss ?</p>
<p>What is the end of Rhetoric, or the object which an orator in speaking has always in view ? <stage>(vide Annotationes, chap. i. 2.)</stage></p>
<p>How does the investment of one's self with moral character effect persuasion in the auditor ? <stage>(vide Schrader's note, 1, 3.)</stage></p>
<p>Must the qualifications by which the speaker invests himself with moral character, be perceived from the speech as existing in him, <stage>(vide Book I. chap. ii. 4,)</stage> or known to have existed in him before ?</p>
<p>From the three distinctions of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστεις</foreign>, what do you infer to be the three great accomplishments of a perfect orator ?</p>
<p>Do I understand you to say, proof by enthymem, investment of himself with moral character, and the excitement of the passions in his auditors ?</p>
<p>What are the three causes of a speaker's effecting persuasion through moral character ?</p>
<p>If a speaker appears to be a man capable of imparting benefits to the state, does he effect persuasion through moral character, by his virtue ? <stage>(vide chap. ix. 4, definition of virtue.)</stage></p>
<p>When Demosthenes in the oration for the crown makes use of the following words,­

to which distinction of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστεις</foreign> does he recur, and through which of the causes <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις, ἀρετὴ</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔνοια</foreign>,does he endeavour to effect persuasion ?</p>
<ab>
<title type="sub">CHAP. II.</title>
</ab>
<p>What are the three questions which Aristotle proposes for consideration in treating of the passions ? <stage>(Book II. chap. i. 9.)</stage></p>
<p>With what view was this threefold division necessary ?</p>
<p>Is it possible to obtain <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόποι</foreign> calculated for the excitement of the passions without a knowledge of these three questions proposed by Aristotle ? <stage>(Book II. chap. i. 9.)</stage></p>
<p>Give the definition of anger.</p>
<p>Is this definition proposed as a <foreign xml:lang="grc">στοιχει̃ον</foreign> from which the
<foreign xml:lang="grc">τόποι</foreign>are afterwards inferred ?</p>
<p>Does not Aristotle explain this definition by two propositions, viz. 1st. Anger is against some individual on account of contempt to one's self or friends. 2nd. Pain is not so much the consequent of anger as a certain pleasure ?</p>
<p>Explain the reference which these two explanatory propositions have to the definition of anger.</p>
<p>To what cause do you attribute the sensation of pain in anger ?</p>
<p>To what causes <stage>(which are two)</stage> do you attribute the sensation of pleasure in anger ?</p>
<pb n="363"/>
<p>Can you give any other reasons why pleasure should be a consequent? <stage>(Book I. chap. x. 17, 18; chap. xi. 10, 12, 13.)</stage></p>
<p>Could you infer a reason from the definition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡδόνη</foreign> in the first book ?</p>
<p>Is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ὀργὴ</foreign> a generic or specific term ?</p>
<p>Under what generic term do you class the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ὀργὴ</foreign> ?</p>
<p>What is the object of anger ?</p>
<p>What is the cause of anger ?</p>
<p>How many species of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> are there ?</p>
<p>Does not Aristotle prove that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατφρόνησις</foreign> is a species of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> from the definition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> ?</p>
<p>Do you consider the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπηρεασμος</foreign> to be a distinct species of
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγωρία</foreign>?</p>
<p>Explain how Aristotle from its own definition proves the
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπηρεασμὸς</foreign> to be a distinct species of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγωρία</foreign>.</p>
<p>Is slight attended with a certain pleasure ?</p>
<p>You have before stated in reply to questions in the former book, that all actions done by men <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκόντες</foreign> are <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὰ</foreign>1*1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαινό­ μενα ἀγαθὰ, ἣ ἡδέα ἣ φαινόμενα ἡδέα</foreign>: can you show that if the
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> be a voluntary act, it must be consequently <foreign xml:lang="grc">̃ἡδύ ἣ
φαινόμενον ἡδὑ</foreign> ?</p>
<p>Why should it not be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸν ἣ φαινόμενον ἀγαθόν</foreign> ? <stage>(Book I. chap. x. 18.)</stage></p>
<p>To what cause do you attribute the pleasure which the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό ὑβρίζων</foreign> feels ?</p>
<p>How then are men affected when they feel anger ?</p>
<p>With what kind of persons do they feel angry ?</p>
<p>What are the causes of this passion ?</p>
<p>What is it incumbent on the orator to prove, to excite anger against his adversary ?</p>
<p>What kind of person must he prove his adversary to be, to merit anger ?</p>
<p>When Aeschines uses the following arguments in his oration against Ctesiphon, does he endeavour to excite anger against Demosthenes ? and by which of the causes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγωρία</foreign>, or its species, does he endeavour to excite it against his adversary ?</p><figure type="illustration">

<p>As the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ πράϋνσις</foreign> is the contrary to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ὀργὴ</foreign>, and the

necessary to propose many questions on this chapter.</p>
<p>What is the definition of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ πράϋνσις</foreign>?</p>
<p>You stated in reply to a former question, that pain and pleasure were consequent to the r'a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθη</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημει̃α</foreign> of the
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡβούλησις</foreign>, <stage>(chap. iv.)</stage> but are they both consequent to the

<p>What are the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημει̃α</foreign> of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ βοῡλησις</foreign>? <stage>(3.)</stage></p>
<p>How many species of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ φίλια</foreign> are there ? <stage>(28.)</stage></p>
<p>What are the causes which give occasion to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡφίλια</foreign> ?</p>
<pb n="365"/>
<p>What is the difference between the it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀργὴ</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ἔχθρα</foreign> ?</p>
<p>How many differences does Aristotle enumerate ?</p>
<p>How many, and what are the causes of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ἔ</foreign>which Aristotle enumerates ? <stage>(30.)</stage></p>
<p>You have stated that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ὀργὴ</foreign> is felt on account of the
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ὀλιγωρία</foreign> and its species ; but if a man is habitually addicted
to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡὀλιωρία</foreign> and its species, are our sentiments those of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡὀργὴ</foreign> or ff <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχθρα</foreign>?</p>
<p>Do anger and hatred ever differ with respect to the objects against whom they are felt ? <stage>(xxxi. line 3, 4.)</stage></p>
<p>Can you class both these passions under the genus <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρέξεις ἄλογοι</foreign>?</p>
<p>Does the sensation of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ λύπη</foreign> accompany the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχθρ</foreign> ? <stage>(xxxi. line 10.)</stage></p>
<p>Which of the two passions, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ὀργὴ</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡἔχθρα</foreign>, does Aristotle consider as incurable ?</p>
<p>You stated in a former chapter that the ff <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιμωρία</foreign> was the object of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡὀργὴ</foreign>, what is the object of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ἔχθρα</foreign> ? <stage>(xxxi. line 6.)</stage></p>
<p>What kind of person will an orator describe his adversary to be, when he endeavours to excite feelings of hatred against him in his auditors ?</p>

<p>Give the definition of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ φόβος</foreign>.</p>
<p>Does it follow from this definition that all the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ κακὰ</foreign>are the objects of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁφόβος</foreign> ?</p>
<p>What kind of evils then excite the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁφόβος</foreign> ?</p>
<p>Is it absolutely necessary for the sensation of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ φόβος</foreign> that the evil should be close at hand ?</p>
<p>Can you mention any circumstances, or characters in life, which excite the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁφόβος</foreign> in others? <stage>(vii. et seq.)</stage></p>
<p>What is the reason that men are not afraid of such evils as death ?</p>
<p>Am I to understand that some hope of safety is essential in the sensation of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁφόβος</foreign> ? <stage>(xiv.)</stage></p>
<p>Is deliberation also essential in the sensation of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁφόβος</foreign>?</p>

<p>In what chief respects do the sensations of the o <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόβος</foreign> and TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινὸν</foreign> differ ?</p>
<p>Do I understand you to say, “ In the feeling of hope and anxiety, and excitement of deliberation, which accompany the one, but are annihilated in the other ? "</p>
<p>Do they differ also in any other remarkable respect ? <stage>(chap. v. 12, line 4; chap. viii. 13, line 4.)</stage></p>

<p>What is the twofold division which Aristotle makes of the men who feel the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ϧάρσος</foreign> ? <stage>(xviii.)</stage></p>
<p>What illustration does Aristotle give in support of this distinction ?</p>
<p>To which of the three species of oration do you consider appeals to the o <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόβος</foreign> most peculiar ?</p>
<p>Give me a reason why you consider them most peculiar to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδος συμβουλευτικὸν</foreign>. <stage>(Confer Book I. chap. iii. 4, with the definition of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">όφόβος</foreign>.)</stage></p>

<p>What is the logical difference which when added to the generic term, gives the specific terms <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ νέμεσις</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁἔλεος</foreign> ? <stage>(i. line 4.)</stage></p>
<p>Does not Aristotle define the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ νέμεσις</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ φθόνος</foreign> by a comparison of each with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁἔλεος</foreign> ?</p>

<p>In what respects do they agree, and in what differ ?</p>
<p>Can you infer that the opposite feelings are consequent to these passions ?</p>
<p>What is the opposite feeling and consequent to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁφθόνος</foreign> ?</p>
<p>What is the opposite feeling and consequent to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἔλεος</foreign> ?</p>

<p>What kind of person must the orator show his adversary to be, when he wishes to excite indignation against him in his auditor ?</p>
<p>Can you infer from its definition that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ νέμεσις</foreign> is felt at the virtues ? <stage>(viii.)</stage></p>
<p>You have stated that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ νέμεσις</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἔλεος</foreign> are directly opposed to each other, and are under the same genus; can you infer therefore, that if the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ νέμεσις</foreign> is not felt at the virtues, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἔλεος</foreign> is not felt at the vices of others ?</p>

<p>Why is it necessary that an orator should consider the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἤθη</foreign> of his auditors in reference to their passions, habits, ages, and fortunes?</p>
<p>Does Aristotle use the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἤθη</foreign> as implying only a certain disposition peculiar to men at a certain time of life, or as implying the a! <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξεις</foreign>, or the virtues and vices ?</p>

<p>You have stated that the orator should consider the ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤθη</foreign> of his auditors in reference to their passions, habits, &amp;c.; under which of the three distinctions of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστεις</foreign> would you place this part of Rhetoric ? <stage>(vide Riccobon in cap. xii. hujus libri.)</stage></p>
<p>Do you consider that, when Aristotle treats of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ πάθη, αἱἓξεις</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἤθη</foreign>, he considers them to have a relation to the three species of oration ?</p>
<p>You stated in reply to a question in the former book, that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱἡλίκιαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύχαι</foreign> of men were not the true causes of actions, but when added to the true causes, give additional weight to an argument in judicial inquiry, <stage>(vide Book I. chap. x.)</stage> do you consider that the orator should adapt his oration to the
<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἤθη</foreign> of his auditors in reference to their passions, habits,
&amp;c., in the demonstrative and judicial species ?</p>
<p>What, generally speaking, are the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἤθη</foreign> consequent to youth and old age ?</p>
<p>What are the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἤθη</foreign> consequent to the middle-aged ?</p>

<p>As Aristotle says that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παράδειγμα</foreign> is like induction, explain in what points they resemble, and in what they differ. <stage>(vide Riccobon in cap. xx. hujus libri.)</stage></p>
<p>How many distinctions of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παράδειγμα</foreign> are there ?</p>
<p>Into how many species is the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτον ποιει̃ν</foreign>, or matter invented by the orator, subdivided ?</p>
<p>Explain what is meant by the species <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραβολὴ</foreign> ?</p>
<p>When Cicero, in his oration against Catiline, says,—" Quod si ex tanta latrocinio iste unus tolletur; videbimur fortasse ad breve quoddam tempus cura et metu esse relevati; periculum autem residebit, et erit inclusum penitus in venis atque visceribus reipublicae. Ut saepe homines aegri morbo gravi cum aestu febrique jactantur, si aquam gelidam biberint, prime relevare videntur; deinde multo gravius vehementiusque afflictantur; sic hie morbus, qui est in republica, relevatus istius poena vehementius, civibus reliquis ingravescet;" is this a
<foreign xml:lang="grc">παραβολὴ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign> ?</p>
<p>When Agrippa Menenius says, " Tempore, quo in homine, non, ut nunc, omnia in unum consentiebant, sed singulus membris suum cuique consilium, suus sermo fuerat, indignatas

reliquas partes, sua cura, suo labore ac ministerio ventri omnia quaeri: ventrem, in medio quietum, nihil aliud, quam datis voluptatibus frui; conspirasse inde, ne manus ad os cibum ferrent, nec os acciperet datum, nec denies conficerent. Hac ira, dum ventrem fame domare vellent, ipsa una membra totumque corpus ad extremam tabem venisse. Inde apparuisse, ventris quoque baud segne ministerium esse: nec magis ali, quam alere eum, reddentem in omnes corporis partes hunc, quo vivimus vigemusque, divisum pariter in venas maturum, confecto cibo, sanguinem. Is this a <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραβολὴ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign> ?</p>
<p>Which of the two distinctions of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παράδειγμα</foreign> do you consider most persuasive in deliberative oratory ?</p>
<p>If the orator has not enthymems at command, how does Aristotle recommend him to use the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παράδειγμα</foreign> ?</p>
<p>But if the orator has both enthymems and examples at command, which does he recommend should be placed before the other ?</p>
<p>In the passage quoted from Cicero does he follow Aristotle's precept or not ?</p>
<p>Why is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παράδειγμα</foreign> and its species, when placed before the enthymems, little adapted to a speech ?</p>
<p>What advantage is gained by placing the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παράδειγμα</foreign> after the enthymem ?</p>
<p>In placing the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παράδειγμα</foreign> after the enthymem will one be a sufficient proof, or are several requisite ?</p>

<p>Define the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέξεως</foreign>c aperi, or excellence of style.</p>
<p>It seems that Aristotle in this definition notes two things as conducive to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέξεως</foreign> apEri, viz. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ σαφη̃</foreign> elai and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρέ­ πουσαν</foreign> ; how are these attained in style ? <stage>(ii. iii. and iv.)</stage></p>
<p>Why does Aristotle object to the too frequent use of

and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίπλοις</foreign> or compound words ?</p>
<p>Is the orator obliged to confine himself to the use of the

other species occasionally ?</p>
<p>What advantage does the use of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύρια</foreign> contribute to style ?</p>

<p>Can you infer from Aristotle's general inference that " those beauties and elegancies of style are most approved which are the quickest in communicating information," any particular rule for the selection of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνθυμήματα</foreign> or arguments ?</p>
<p>In treating of such <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀστει̃α</foreign> as metaphor, simile, enthymem, and antithesis, why has Aristotle treated of antithesis as belonging to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ σχη̃μα τὴς λέξεως</foreign>, and the others <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τὴν διάνοιαν του̃ λεγομένου</foreign> ? <stage>(chap. ii. 6; ix. 7.)</stage></p>

<note type="footnote" n="1"> However ready we may be to acknowledge the wonderful acuteness and subtlety of Aristotle's mind, in unfolding the whole art of rhetoric, his judgment of true wit, from the samples afforded in this chapter, convinces us, that he was a more profound philosopher than agreeable companion.

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>-1. RHETORIC corresponds with Logic, since <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφότεραι περὶ τοιούτων τινω̄ν εἰσιν</foreign>, &amp; <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινὰ τρόπον τινὰ ἁπάντων ἐστὶ γνωρίζειν, κα</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεμια̃ς ἐπιστήμης ἀφωρισμένης</foreign>.</p>
<p>2. But since men do it not only <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκη̃</foreign>, but also <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ συνήθειαν</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕξεως, εἴη ἂν αὐτό κα</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁδοποιει̃ν</foreign>, and therefore <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν αἰτίαν θεω­ ρει̃ν ἐνδέχεται</foreign>. Consequently, there must be an art of Rhetoric.</p>
<p>3. But previous writers have done but little towards it, for
<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ πίστεις ἔντεχνόν ἐστι</foreign> <unclear>μóνoν·</unclear> ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>' <unclear>ἀλλα</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσθη̃και</foreign>, and they
have neglected enthymems, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅπερ ἐστ</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">σω̃μα τη̃ς πίστεως</foreign>.</p>
<p>4. But appeals to the passions, ov <foreign xml:lang="grc">περ</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῡ πράγματός ἐστιν</foreign>,</p>
<p>5. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ πρός τόν δικαστήν</foreign>* which is unjust, and avoided by the Areopagus.</p>
<p>6. The business of the pleader is only with the fact, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι ὄστιν ἢ οὐκ ἔστιν, ἢ γέγονεν ἢ</foreign> ov <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέγονεν</foreign>* not with the question of its importance.</p>
<p>7. Laws would therefore be best, if they could mark out <stage>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">διορίζειν</foreign>)</stage> all cases, and leave but little to the judges, both on account of the difficulty of getting many good men to legislate, and because <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὶ μὲν νομοθεσίαι ἐκ πολλου̃ σκεψαμένων</foreign> 
<foreign xml:lang="grc">γνονται</foreign>* <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ δὲ κρίσεις ἐξ ὑπογύου</foreign>* and because the legislator
does not judge for the present and particular case, but for the future and universal, and is therefore free from prejudice or passion.</p>
<p>9. Therefore the exordium, narrative, etc. have nothing to do with the art, as all that aims at making the judge <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιόν</foreign> rtva.

<p>2. The hearer is either <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρός περ</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̃ς δυνάμεως</foreign>, <stage>(the skill of the orator,)</stage> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">κριτὴς</foreign>, i. e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κριτὴς ἢ τω̃ν γεγενηένων, ἢ τω̃ν μελλόντων</foreign>, the latter being <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησιαστὴς</foreign>, the former <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστής</foreign>.</p>

For thence was the poet Epicharmus, who was much prior to Chonides and Magnes. But some of those Dorians who inhabit Peloponnesus lay claim to tragedy, making names an evidence. For they allege that they call their villages komai, but the Athenians demo;; as if comedians were not so denominated from komazein, [i. e. to revel,] but from their wandering through villages, being ignominiously expelled from the cities.

For men of a more venerable character imitated beautiful actions, and the actions of such men; but the more ignoble imitated the actions of depraved characters, first composing vituperative verses, in the same manner as the others composed hymns and encomiums.

The end of tragedy, therefore, does not consist in imitating manners, but it embraces manners on account of actions; so that the action and the fable are the end of tragedy.

Again, it is likewise an evidence of this, that those who attempt to write tragedies, acquire the power of expressing a thing in tragic diction and manners accurately, before they can compose a fable, as was the case with nearly all the first poets. The fable, therefore, is the principal part, and as it were the soul of tragedy; but the manners are next in rank8. [Just as in painting, if any one were to spread the most beautiful pigments on promiscuously, he would not please the view so much as by outlining an image with white colour only.

Since, therefore, it is necessary that the composition of the most beautiful tragedy should not be simple, but complex, and that it should be imitative of fearful and piteous actions—(for this is the peculiarity of such imitation) -in the first place it is evident, that it is not proper that worthy men should be represented as changed from prosperity to adversity, <stage>(for this is neither a subject of terror nor commiseration, but is impious,)</stage> nor should depraved characters [be represented as changed] from adversity to prosperity; for this is the most foreign from tragedy of all things, since it possesses nothing which is proper; for it neither appeals to moral sense, nor is piteous, nor fearful. Nor, again, must a very depraved man be represented as having fallen from prosperity into adversity. For such a composition will indeed possess moral tendency, but not pity or fear. For the one is conversant with a character which does not deserve to be unfortunate; but the other, with a character similar [to one's own]. [And pity, indeed, is excited for one who does not deserve to be unfortunate; but fear, for one who resembles oneself2] ; so that the event will neither appear to be commiserable, nor terrible.

But

<note type="margin"> 5. Proof from the popular subjects of tragedy. </note> the proof of this is what has taken place. For of old the poets adopted any casual fables; but now the most beautiful tragedies are composed about a few families; as for instance, about Alcmaeon, CEdipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, and Telephus4, and such other persons as happen either to have suffered or done things of a dreadful nature. The tragedy, therefore, which is most beautiful according to art, is of this construction. Hence they erroneously blame

For this method, as we have said, is right; of which this is the greatest evidence, that in the scenes, and contests of the players, simple fables which terminate unhappily appear to be most tragical, if they are properly acted. And Euripides, though he does not manage other things well, yet appears to be the most tragic of poets5. The fable,

<note type="margin"> 7. but least popular, </note> however, ranks in the second place, though by some it is said to be the first composition, which has a twofold construction, such as the Odyssey, and which terminates in a contrary fortune, both to the better

bination of the incidents, which is preferable, and the province of a better poet. For it is necessary that the fable should be so composed, that he who hears the things which are transacted, may be seized with horror, and feel pity, from the events, without the assistance of the sight; and in this manner any one who hears the fable of CEdipus is affected. But to effect this through spectacle is more inartificial, and requires great expense 2. But they who produce

<note type="margin"> 2. The monstrous not tragic. </note> not the terrible, but the monstrous alone, through scenic representation, have nothing in common with tragedy. For it is not proper to expect every kind of pleasure from tragedy, but that which is appropriate. Since, however, it is necessary that the

<note type="margin"> 3. The proper pleasure to be derived from tragedy. 4. What actions are dreadful or lamentable. </note> poet should procure pleasure from pity and fear through imitation, it is evident that this must be effected by the circumstances. Let us, then, ascertain what kind of events appear to be dreadful or lamentable. But it is necessary that actions of this kind should either be those of friends towards each other, or of enemies, or of neither. If, therefore, an enemy kills an enemy, he does not show any thing which is an object of pity, neither while he does the deed, nor when he is about to do it, except what arises from the deed itself. And this will be the case, when one of those who are neither friends nor enemies do the same. But when these things happen in friendships3, as when a brother kills a brother, or a son his father, or a mother her son, or a son his mother, or intends to do it, or does any thing else of the like kind-such subjects are to be sought for. One must not, therefore, [completely] alter the received fables. I mean, for instance, such as the

<note type="margin"> 6. Examples. </note> manner, let us explain more clearly. Now, the action may take place in such a way as the ancients have represented it, viz. knowingly with intent; as Euripides represents Medea killing her children. Men may also do an action, who are ignorant of, and afterwards discover their connexion [with, the injured party,] as in the " CEdipus" of Sophocles. This, therefore, is extraneous to the drama4, but is in the tragedy itself; as in the " Alcmaeon " of Astydamas, or Telegonus in the " Ulysses Wounded 5."

But of these, to intend to perpetrate the deed knowingly, and not to perpetrate it, is the worst; for it is wicked and not tragical; because it is void of pathos.

<note type="footnote" n="5"> Of these two dramas nothing more is known than the little that Aristotle here tells us. In the first, the poet adhered so far to history, as to make Alcmaeon kill his mother Eriphyle, but with the improvement, (according to Aristotle's idea,) of making him do it ignorantly. The story of Telegonua is, that he was a son of Ulysses by Circe; was sent by her in quest of his father, whom he wounded, without knowing him, in a skirmish relative to some sheep, that he attempted to carry off from the island of Ithaca. It is somewhat singular, that the wound is said to have been given with a kind of Otaheite spear, headed with a sharp fish-bone. See Pope's Odyssey, xi. 167, and the note. Twining. </note>

<note type="chapter"> 9. </note> is the best; I mean, as in the "Cresphontes, in which Merope is about to kill her son, but does not, in consequence of discovering that he was her son. Thus, too, in the " Iphigenia in Tauris," in which the sister is going to kill the brother, [but recognises him;] and in the " Helle," the son is about to betray his mother, but is prevented by recognising her.

<p>IT is necessary, however, that the poet should form

For thus, the poet perceiving most acutely, as if present with the transactions themselves, will discover what is becoming, and whatever is repugnant will be least concealed from his view. An evidence of this is the fault with which Carcinus is reproached. For Amphiaraus had left the temple, which was concealed from the spectator, who did not perceive it, and the piece was driven<ref n="5"/> from the stage in consequence of the indignation of the spectators.

It is likewise necessary that the poet should in a general way lay down the fables composed by others, and those which he composes himself, and afterwards introduce episodes and lengthen out [the play]. But I say that he should give a general sketch after this manner. Thus, for instance, in the " Iphigenia5," a certain virgin on the point of being sacrificed, and vanishing from the view of those who were to sacrifice her, and being brought to another country in which it was a law to sacrifice strangers to a certain goddess, she is appointed the priestess of these rites. Some time after, it happened that the brother of the priestess came to this place ; [but on what account ? Because some god had ordered him, for a certain reason which does not pertain to the general view of the tragedy,] to come thither, [but why he did so is foreign to the fable6]. The brother, therefore, coming, and being made captive, discovered [his sister], when he is going to be sacrificed ; whether, as Euripides says, [by an epistle,] or, as Poly ides feigns, speaking according to probability, because he said, it was not only requisite that the sister, but that he also should be sacri-

It is especially necessary, therefore, that the poet should endeavour to have all these species; or at least that he should have the greatest and most of them, especially since men of the present age calumniate the poets. For as there have been good poets in each part of tragedy, they now expect one poet to excel in all the parts. But it is right to call tragedy different and the same, though not perhaps with any reference to the fable; but this [may be the case with those] of which there is the same plot and solution. But many poets complicate well, and develope badly4. But both these should always be applauded 5. But it is necessary to recollect, as has been often observed, that we must

<note type="margin"> 5. Illustrations. </note> duced would be very contrary to expectation. The truth of this is indicated by such as have represented [in one tragedy] the whole destruction of Troy, and not some part of it, as the "Niobe" or "Medea" of Euripides, and who have not acted like Aeschylus; for these have either been condemned,

<note type="footnote" n="3"> Aeschylus wrote a tragedy so named.

What difference, however,

<note type="footnote" n="7"> This expression does not, I think, necessarily imply any stronger censure of Euripides, than that the choral odes of his tragedies were, in general, more loosely connected with the subject, than those of Sophocles; which, on examination, would, I believe, be found true. For that this is the fault here meant, not the improper " choice of the persons who compose the chorus," as the ingenious translator of Euripides understands, is, I think, plain from what immediately follows; the connexion being this :—" Sophocles is, in this respect, most perfect; Euripides less so ; as to the others, their choral songs are totally foreign to the subject of their tragedies."

<note type="margin"> 1. Diction and sentiment. </note> OF the other parts of tragedy enough has now been said. But it remains that we should speak concerning the diction and the sentiments. The particulars, therefore, respecting the sentiments, are unfolded in the treatise on Rhetoric, to which it more properly belongs. But those things pertain to the sentiments, which it is requisite to procure by a reasoning pro-

It is evident, however, that in things, also, it is requisite to derive what is useful from the same forms, when it is necessary to procure objects of pity, or things that are dreadful, or great, or probable. Except that there is this difference, that things in tragedy ought to be rendered apparent without teaching, but in an oration they are to be shown by the speaker, and in consequence of the speech. For what employment would there be for the orator, if the things should appear [of themselves]

For who would think that Homer errs in what he is reproved for by Protagoras? viz. that while he fancies he prays, he commands, when he says, " The wrath, O goddess, sing."

<note type="margin"> 1. The parts of diction. </note> viz. the letter, the syllable, the conjunction, the noun, the verb, the article, the case, and the sentence. The

<note type="footnote"> totle in this place, are plainly such as would have been denominated by later writers, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήατα σιανοίας</foreign>—figures of the thought or sense. Indeed we find them actually enumerated among the figures of that class. See Dionys. Halicarn. de Struct. etc. Sect. 8.—So Quintilian; " Figuras quoque mentis, quae <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήματασιανοίας</foreign> dicuntur, res eadem recipit omnes, in quas nonnulli diviserunt species dictorum, (i. e. of jokes, bons mots).

For <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέξις</foreign>, it must be observed, is here used, not in the particular sense of diction, or style and manner of expression, (as it is used Rhet. iii. 8,) but in the general sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>, speech, as we find it used in the beginning of the next chapter. </note>

letter, therefore, indeed, is an indivisible sound2; yet not every such sound, but that from which an intelligible sound is adapted to be produced. For there are indivisible vocal sounds of brutes, no one of which

<note type="margin"> 3. Their divisions, </note> I call a letter3. But the parts of this indivisible sound are, vowel, semi vowel, and mute. And a vowel, indeed, is that which has an audible sound, without percussion 4; such as a and o. But a semivowel is that which has an audible sound, with percussion ; as s and r. And a mute is that which, even with the concurrence of the tongue, has of itself, indeed, no sound, but becomes audible in conjunction with things which have a certain sound; as g and

<note type="margin"> 4. and differences. </note> d. But these differ by the configurations of the mouth, in the parts [of the mouth 5] by density and tenuity of aspiration, by length and shortness; and further still, they differ by acuteness and gravity, and by the medium between both these; the theory respecting each of which pertains to the metrical

<note type="margin"> 5. Syllables. </note> art. But a syllable is a sound without signification, composed from a mute, and an element which has sound [i. e. from a vowel, or semivowel]. For g r without a is a syllable6, and also with a, as g r a.

He observes: " Literally, percussion, i. e. of the tongue against the palate, or teeth, the lips against the teeth, or against each other, and all the other modes of consonant articulation. See Hermes, iii. 2. p. 322, where they are called ' contacts.' Dacier makes sad confusion here, both in his version and his notes, by confounding the names of the consonants, when vowels are prefixed, or put after them, to make them separately pronouncible, (Te, eF, eL, etc.,) with their powers in composition—as elements of words. Thus, it is strictly true, that S and R have a sound, without the assistance of a vowel, merely by their mode of articulation. But D, or G, have no sound at all by themselves. The semivowels are 1, m, n, r, s. (Dion. Halicarn. De Struct. Orate sect. 14.) " </note>

The study, however, of the differences of these, pertains also to the metrical art. But a conjunction is

<note type="margin"> 6. Conjunction. </note> a sound void of signification, which neither impedes nor produces one significant sound adapted to be composed from many sounds, and which may be placed either at the beginning or the end of the period, unless something requires that it should be placed by itself at the beginning; such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν, ἥτοι, δή</foreign>. Or it is a sound without signification, composed from more sounds than one, but naturally adapted to produce one significant sound. An article is a sound

<note type="margin"> 7. Article. </note> without signification, which snows the beginning, or end, or distinction of a word 7; as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ φημί</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign>ro
<foreign xml:lang="grc">περί</foreign>, and others of the like kind. Or it is a sound
without signification, which neither impedes nor produces one significant sound naturally adapted to be composed from many sounds, both in the extremes and in the middle. But a noun is a composite sound,

<note type="margin"> </note>

<note type="margin"> 8. Noun. </note> significant without time, ot which no part is of itself significant. For in double nouns, we do not use the parts as of themselves significant. Thus, in the word Theodorus, [though Theos signifies God and doron a gift,] yet doron signifies nothing. A verb is a 

<note type="margin"> 9. Verb. </note> posite sound, significant with time, 01 which no part is of itself significant, in the same manner also as in nouns. For man or white does not signify time; but he walks, or he did walk, signify, the former indeed the present, and the latter the past time. But case

<note type="margin"> 10. Case. </note> pertains to noun or verb. And one case, indeed, [in nouns] signifies that something is said of this thing, or is attributed to<ref n="8"/> this thing, and the like;

<note type="footnote" n="7"> This description is most obscure ; but the sense seems to be, that an article is a sound which of itself does not signify any thing definite, but merely serves to indicate a significant sound, before or after which it is placed, or which it distinguishes from other words. Taylor. Ritter denies that there is any sense at all, an opinion in which the reader will probably acquiesce. </note>

<note type="footnote" n="8"> These only, in modern grammar, are called cases: in Aristotle, number, whether in noun or verb, and the tenses, and modes, (or moods,) of verbs, are comprehended under that term; because cases (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πτωσεις</foreign>—cases) are endings, terminations, inflections, etc., and, in the learned languages, all the </note>

<note type="margin"> 11. Sentence. </note> case of a verb according to these species. And a sentence is a composite significant sound, of which certain parts of themselves signify something; for not every sentence is composed from nouns and verbs, <stage>(since the definition of man10 is a sentence without a verb,)</stage> but there may be a sentence without verbs. A sentence, however, will always have some part significant; as in the sentence Cleon walks, the

<note type="margin"> 12. Its unity. </note> word Cleon is significant. But a sentence is one in a twofold respect; for it is either that which signifies one thing, or that which becomes one from many by conjunction 11. Thus the Iliad, indeed, is one by conjunction; but the definition of man is one, because it signifies one thing.]</p>

A noun also may be triple and quadruple, as is the case with many of the nouns of the Megaliotae1; such as Hermocaïcoxanthus2. But every noun is either proper or foreign3, or me-

<note type="footnote"> I I have read, in some ludicrous book, of a country that was " lost by the ignorance of geographers." This seems to have been the case of these Megaliotae, if such a people ever existed. They are no where recorded.—Dacier reads, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγαρι­ ζόντων</foreign>—" ceux qui di8ent de grandes choses:" and cites Hesychius—<foreign xml:lang="grc">Μεγαρίζοντες</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγαλα λέγοντες</foreign>. But this is too distant from the present reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μεγαλιωτω̃ν</foreign>. Winstanley's conjecture—<foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγαλείων, ὼς</foreign>, is somewhat nearer, and, in other respects, preferable: but it is, I think, a strong presumption against its truth, that Aristotle constantly uses <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἲον</foreign>, when he gives an instance; never, as far as I recollect, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὼς</foreign>. </note>

<note type="footnote"> I have sometimes thought it not very improbable, that the passage might originally have stood thus: <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν μέγαλΑ Διω</foreign>- KON <foreign xml:lang="grc">των</foreign> : i. e. of those who affect, aim at, are fond of, grandeur and pomp of expression; who love hard words, as we say.

For to be moored is a species of standing. But a transposition from species to genus is such as, Ten thousand valiant deeds Ulysses has achieved9. For ten thousand is a great number, and is now used instead of many. And a transposition from species to species is such as, The brazen falchion drew away his life. And, Cut by the ruthless sword 10. For here to draw away, is used instead of to cut; and to cut is used instead of to draw away: since

<note type="margin">6. Analogous. </note> both imply the taking something away. But I call it analogous, when the relation of the second term to the first is similar to that of the fourth to the third; for then the fourth is used instead of the second, or the second instead of the fourth. [And sometimes the proper term is added to the relative terms11.] I say, for instance, a cup has a similar relation to Bacchus that a shield has to Mars. Hence, a shield may be called the cup of Mars, and a cup the shield of Bacchus. Again, evening has the same relation to day that old age has to life. One may therefore say that

<note type="footnote" n="7"> Aristotle understands metaphor in a more extended sense than we do, for we only consider the third and fourth of the kinds enumerated by him, as metaphors. Our usurpation of the word was in vogue in Cicero's time. See de Orate III. 38, sqq. Ritter. </note>

evening is the old age of day, and that old age is the evening of life ; or as Empedocles calls it, " The setting of life 12." In some instances, also, where there

<note type="margin"> 7. Means of employing them. </note> is no analogous name, this method may be no less similarly employed. Thus, to scatter grain is to sow; but there is no name for the scattering of light from the sun, and yet this has a similar relation to the sun that sowing has to grain. Hence, it is said, Sowing his god-created flame. This mode of metaphor may likewise be used differ-

<note type="chapter"> 8. </note> ently, when, calling a thing by a foreign name, something belonging to it is denied of it; as if one should call a shield not the cup of Mars, but the wineless cup. But an invented noun is that, in short, which,

<note type="margin"> 9. Invented words. </note> not being adopted by others, is introduced by the poet himself. For it appears that there are certain nouns of this kind ; as substituting <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒρνυγες</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέρατα</foreign> for horns 13, and calling a priest <foreign xml:lang="grc">άρητήρ</foreign>14instead of

tended and con tracted. </note> by using a vowel longer than the proper one, or by inserting a syllable ; and partly by taking something away from it. An extended noun, indeed, is such as

Thus, for instance, Aeschylus and Euripides made the same Iambic verse; but by only changing one word from its proper and usual to a foreign signification, the one verse appears beautiful, and the other mean.

<note type="margin"> 1. On narrative poetry. Its similarity to tragedy. </note> CONCERNING the poetry, however, which is narrative and imitative in metre, it is evident that it ought to have dramatic fables, in the same manner as tragedy, and should be conversant with one whole and perfect action, which has a beginning, middle, and end, in order that, like one whole animal, it may produce its appropriate pleasure 1; and that it may not be like the custom of histories, in which it is not necessary to treat of one action, but of one time, viz. of such things as have happened in that time, respecting one or more persons, the relation of each of which things

<note type="chapter"> 2. </note> to the other is just as it may happen. For as the sea-fight at Salamis, and the battle with the Carthaginians in Sicily, though they happened at the same time, tend nothing to the same end; thus also in successive times, one thing may sometimes be connected with another, from which no one end is produced.

<note type="margin"> 3. Praise of Homer, and comparison with other poets. </note> But nearly all poets do this. Hence, as we have before observed, in this respect also Homer will appear to be divine, when compared with other poets, because he did not attempt to sing of the whole of the Trojan war, though it had a beginning and an end. For if he had, it would have been very great, and not sufficiently conspicuous; or if it bad been of a moderate size, it would have been intricate through the variety of incidents 2. But now, having selected one part of the war, he has made use of many episodes; such as the catalogue of the ships, and other episodes, with which he has adorned his

For of his two poems, the Iliad indeed contains the simple and pathetic; but the Odyssey, the complex; for through the whole of it there is discovery<ref n="2"/> and moral. And besides these things, he excelled all poets in diction and sentiment. The epopee, however, differs from tragedy in the length of the composition, and in the metre. But the proper boundary of its length has been before described ; for it should be such that the beginning and the end may be seen at one view. [And this will be effected if the compositions are shorter than those of the ancient poets, and brought to the same length with the multitude of tragedies that are recited at one hear-

<note type="margin"> 4.

But in the epopee, in consequence of its being a narration, many events may be introduced which have happened at the same time, which are properly connected with the subject, and from which the bulk of the poem is increased. Hence, this contributes to its magnificence, transports the hearer to different places, and adorns the poem with dissimilar episodes. For similitude of events rapidly

But this is a paralogism. For men fancy that when the consequent follows or results from the antecedent, the consequent may be converted, and that the antecedent will follow from the consequent. This, however, is false. [But why, if the antecedent be false, so long as this other be otherwise, should the consequent necessarily follow ?

Fables also should not be composed from irrational parts, [but as much as possible, indeed, they should have nothing irrational in them: if, however, this is impossible, care should be taken that the irrational circumstance does not pertain to the fable, as in the case of Œdipus not knowing how Laius died 12.

Since the poet is an imitator, in the same manner as a painter, or any other person who makes likenesses, it is necessary that he should always imitate one of the three [objects of imitation].

It seems, indeed, intended as an apology for Poetry, and a vindication of its privileges upon true poetical principles, at a time when the art and its professors were unfairly attacked on all sides, by the cavils of prosaic philosophers and sophists, such as Ariphrades, Protagoras, Euclid, etc., and by the puritanical objections of PLATO and his followers.

<note type="margin"> 6. Whence objections may be removed. </note> fute the objections of critics from surveying these particulars. For in the first place, indeed, the poet errs, if what he fabricates is impossible according to the art itself; but it will be right if the end of poetry is obtained by it. For we have before shown what the end is, viz. if the poet thus renders what he fabricates, or any other part of the poem, more capable of producing a more striking effect5. An example of this is the pursuit of Hector. If, however, this end can be more or less attained, and that according to the art pertaining to these things, then the fault will not be excusable. For it is requisite if possible to be entirely without error. Further still, it should be considered whether the error ranks among things essential to the poetic art, or foreign and incidental. For it is a less fault not to know that a hind has no horns, than to depict a bad copy of one. Besides this, also, if the poet is blamed for

<note type="chapter"> 6. </note> not imitating things as they truly are, the reply is, but he imitates them as they should be. Thus Sophocles said, that he described men such as they should be, but Euripides such as they are. If, however, it should be objected, that the poet represents things in neither of these ways, he may say that he represents them as men say they are; as, for instance, in things pertaining to the gods. For per-

from what Glauco says21, [when he asserts that] " some men presuppose irrationally, and then reason from their own decision: and, having once pronounced their opinion, reprobate whatever is contrary to their [preconceived] opinion." This was the case with respect to Icarius. For the multitude fancy that he was a Laconian. On this supposition, therefore, it is absurd that Telemachus should not meet him, on his arrival at Lacedaemon22. Perhaps, however, the truth is as the Cephalenians say, viz. that Ulysses married among them, and that Icadius, and not Icarius, [was his father-in-law]. It is probable, therefore, that this

<note type="chapter"> 17. </note> objection is erroneous. In short, it is necessary to refer the impossible either to the poetry, or to that which is better, or to opinion. For, with respect to poetry, probable impossibility is more eligible, than the improbable and possible, and things should be such as Zeuxis23 painted. And also [we may refer the impossible] to that which is better24: for it is necessary that the pattern should transcend those things which are said to be irrational. The objection, also, that something is irrational may be solved by saying, that sometimes it is not irrational; for it is probable that what is improbable may have happened. But

<note type="footnote" n="23">" In ancient days, while Greece was flourishing in liberty and arts, a celebrated painter, [Zeuxis,] having drawn many excellent pictures for a certain free state, and been generously rewarded for his labours, at last made an offer to paint them a Helen, as a model and exemplar of the most exquisite beauty. The proposal was readily accepted, when the artist informed them, that in order to draw one Fair, it was necessary he should contemplate many. He demanded, therefore, a sight of all their finest women. The state, to assist the work, assented to his request. They were exhibited before him; he selected the most beautiful; and from these formed his Helen, more beautiful than them all.”—Harris’s Three Treatises, p. 216. Twining. </note>

Hence, Myniscus called Callipides an ape, in consequence of carrying his imitation to a great excess. And there was also a similar opinion respecting Pindar [the player]. But as these latter actors are to the former, so is the whole art of tragedy to the epopee. They say, therefore, that the epopee is calculated for hearers of the better sort, on which account it does not require scenery; but that tragedy is calculated for the vulgar. Hence, tragic imitation, which is troublesome to the spectator, will evidently be inferior to epic imitation.</p>
<p>In the first place, however, this accusation does

Twining. Sheridan has burlesqued this habit of " suiting the action with admirable humour in " the Critic." Sir Christopher Hatton turning out his toes, Lord Burleigh shaking his head, and Tilburnia going mad in white satin, are among the best of his innumerable facetiae on the subject.

but only that which is bad; and hence Callipedes was blamed, as others now are for imitating light women4. Further still, tragedy, in the same manner as the epopee, may fulfil its purpose without gesture ; for by reading, it is manifest what kind of thing it is. If, therefore, it is in other respects better, it is not necessary that it should be accompanied [by motion and

<note type="margin"> 4. Reasons for the superiority of tragedy. </note> gesture]. In the next place, tragedy has every thing which the epopee possesses. For it may use metre, and it has also music and scenery, as no small parts, through which the pleasure it produces is most apparent. To which may be added, that it possesses perspicuity, both when it is read, and when it is

<note type="chapter"> 5. </note> acted. The end, too, of its imitation is confined in less extended limits. For being crowded into a narrower compass, it becomes more pleasing than if it were diffused through a long period of time. Thus, for instance, if one were to put the CEdipus of Sophocles into as many verses as the Iliad, Fit would

<note type="chapter"> 6. </note> be less pleasing]. Again, the imitation of the epopee has less unity [than tragic imitation]; of which this is an indication, that from any kind of [epic] imitation many tragedies may be produced. Hence, if he who writes an epic poem should choose a fable perfectly one, the poem would necessarily either appear short, as if curtailed, or if it should be accompanied with length of metre, it would seem to be languid5. But if he should compose one fable from many fables, I mean, if the poem should consist of many actions, it would not possess unity. Thus, the Iliad and Odyssey contain many such parts, which of themselves possess magnitude, though these poems are composed, as much as possible, in the most excellent

<note type="footnote" n="4"> Taylor has gone fearfully astray in his version, " for not imitating free women"! The negative particle belongs to the adjective. Twining observes: " as no actresses were admitted on the Greek stage, their capital actors must frequently have appeared in female parts, such as Electra, Iphigenia, Medea, etc. This is sufficiently proved by many passages of ancient authors; and among others, by a remarkable story of Polus, an eminent Greek Tragic actor, told by Aulus Gellius </note>

<note type="chapter"> 7. </note> particulars, and besides this, in the work of art, <stage>(for neither tragic nor epic imitation ought to produce a casual pleasure, but that which has been stated,)</stage> it is evident that it will be more excellent than the epopee, in consequence of attaining its end in a greater degree. And thus much concerning tragedy,

<p>1.—1. ON Poetry in general, its species and parts.</p>
<p>2. Now, all Poetry is an imitation, as also flute and cithern- playing, but they differ either in the means, the objects, or the manner of their imitation.</p>
<p>6. Epopee imitates <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνον</foreign> rOI, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγοις ψιλοῐς ἣ τοῐς μέτροις</foreign>, either simple or mixed.</p>
<p>7. But custom has falsely connected the name of poet with the metre only, and not with their manner of imitation, as is shown in the case of Empedocles and Chaeremon.</p>
<p>10. Dithyrambs, nomes, tragedy, and comedy employ all the means of imitation, but some do so all together, others separately.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>—1. But since actions are the objects of imitation, the characters must be bad or good, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακία</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ὰρετῇ</foreign> ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤθη διαφέρουσι πάντες</foreign>; and hence men must be imitated either as they are, or under a more exalted or more contemptible view, as in the respective paintings of Dionysius, Polygnotus, and Pauson. The same thing holds good in other arts, and in Poetry, as is shown by Cleophon, Homer, and Hegemon respectively.</p>
<p>4. And hence is the difference of tragedy and comedy, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὴ μὲν γὰρ χείρους</foreign>,<ref n="4"/> <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ βελτίους μιμεῐσθαι βούλεται</foreign> rwv <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῠν</foreign>.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>—1. The third difference is as to the manner of imitation. For the poet may imitate the same object, and by the same means, but he may do so either, i. in narrative, i. e. by

<note type="footnote"> * As I follow the text of Ritter, no analysis will of course be made of such passages as are satisfactorily proved, by this scholar, to be spurious, especially when such passages are but an analysis of what has been already said in the Rhetoric. </note>
<pb n="479"/>
personating other characters, or in his own person. n. Or he may represent <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντας ώς πράττοντας καὶ ὲνεργοῠντας</foreign>.</p>
<p>2. Since, then, there are three differences of imitation <stage>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">έν οἶς τε καὶ ᾰ καὶ ὣς</foreign>)</stage>, Sophocles agrees with Homer, because both imitate <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς σπουδαίους</foreign>, but with Aristophanes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂτι τοὺς πράττοντας</foreign>. [Hence the Dorians lay an etymological claim to the invention of the Drama and Comedy, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δράματα, ὂτι μιμοῠν</foreign>­<figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig93.jpg"/></figure>
</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/> Two natural causes of Poetry, i. To imitate is the peculiar faculty and pleasure of man, as is evident from his taste for images, pictures, etc., the resemblance even of the worst objects causing satisfaction. And this results from the pleasure felt in learning and forming conclusions.</p>
<p>6. II. Moreover, rhythm and harmony are equally natural to us, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μέτρα μόρια τῶν ῥυθμῶν</foreign> cori.</p>
<p>Poetry, therefore, gradually arose from the combined exertions of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὶ μιμητικοὶ</foreign> feat <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὶ μετρικοί</foreign>.</p>
<p>7. And of these men oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεμνότεροι τὰς καλὰς έμιμοῠντο πράξ</foreign>­ <figure type="illustration">

one writing hymns and encomia, the others satires, of which Homer’s Margites was the earliest known.</p>
<p>8. Iambic was the fit metre for vituperation. But Homer, by substituting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ γελοῐον</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψόγος</foreign>, suggested comedy, for his Margites has the same relation to comedy as the Iliad to tragedy. 10. And the heroic and vituperative poets respectively became <foreign xml:lang="grc">τραγωδιδάσκαλοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωμωδοποιοί</foreign>.</p>
<p>11. Tragedy and comedy were at first <foreign xml:lang="grc">άυτοσχεδιαστικαί</foreign>, the one resulting <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰπὸ τῶν έξαρχόντων τὸν διθύραμβον</foreign>, but the other
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰπο</foreign> rwv <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ φαλλικά</foreign>; they then gradually increased, as 
provements presented themselves.</p>
<p>13. AEschylus added a second actor, and gave the pre-eminence to the dialogue <stage>(see, however, the note)</stage>. Sophocles added a third, and introduced scenic decoration. While tragedy remained in its simple, satyric state, the Trochaic metre was employed; but, on its improvement, the Iambic, as being the most naturally adapted to every-day discourse. The Trochaic Poetry was <foreign xml:lang="grc">σατυρικὴ καὶ ὸρχηστικωτερὴ</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ίαμβεῐον μάλιστα λεκτικὸν τῶν μέτρων</foreign>.</p>

<p>2. The progress of comedy, from its being for a long time unpopular, is unknown, but its poets are known from the time when it began to possess any form.</p>
<p>3. The inventor of masks, dialogues, and an increased number of actors is likewise unknown. But Epicharmus and Phormis of Sicily first invented comic fables, but Crates was the first Athenian who began <foreign xml:lang="grc">άφέμενος τῆς ίαμβικῆς ίδέας καθόλου ποιεῐν λόγους καὶ μύθους</foreign>, to introduce dialogues and plots of a regular character.</p>
<p>4. Tragic Poetry and epic agree in imitating <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺςσπου­ δαίους</foreign>, but epic differs from it <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ τὸ μέτρον άπλοῠν ἓχειν καὶ άπαγγελίαν εἶναι</foreign>, and also ri <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήκει</foreign>. For epopee is <foreign xml:lang="grc">άόριστος τῷ χρόνῳ</foreign>, but tragedy <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὺπὸ μίαν περίοδον ήλίου</foreign>. But at first there was no such restriction.</p>
<p>5. As all the parts of epic Poetry are found in tragic, <stage>(but not vice versâ,)</stage> a judge of the former will be a judge of the latter also.</p><figure type="illustration">

<pb n="481"/>
<p>9. The most important is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ</foreign> rwv <foreign xml:lang="grc">πραγμάτων ϭύϭταϭις</foreign>, for tragedy imitates actions, not men, and manners only as far as they are involved by actions. Hence action is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλοςο</foreign>f tragedy.</p>
<p>11. For it may exist without manners, but cannot without action: the later authors are imperfect in manners.</p>
<p>12. Nor would a whole string of well mannered incidents please so well as a regular plot.</p>
<p>13. And, moreover, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μέγιϭτα οἷςΨυχαγωγει̃ ἡ τραγψὸία</foreign>, rav <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύθουμέρη ἑϭτὶν, αι̃τεπεριπετείαι καὶἀναγνωρίϭεις</foreign>. And men arrive at perfection in diction and manners, sooner than in constructing plots. [The rest of this chapter is a repetition, and is inconsistent with Aristotle's own ideas in other places. See Ritter.]</p><figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig96.jpg"/></figure>
<p>4. Again, whatever is beautiful, must not only have a proper arrangement of its parts, but must be of a proper magnitude, neither too large for its parts to be comprehended, nor too small.</p><figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig97.jpg"/></figure>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>—1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μυ̃θοςι</foreign>s one, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐὰν περὶἕνα ἦ</foreign>, as the authors of Heracleids, etc. have wrongly supposed, but because it is the imitation of one entire action, complete in all its parts.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>—1. Moreover it is not the poet's province to relate <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ γινόμενα</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷα</foreign> av <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένοιτο, καὶ τὰ δυνατὰ κατὰτὸ εἰκὸς, ἤΤΟ ἀναγκαι̃ον</foreign>. For this is the proper difference between the historian and poet, not the use of metre.</p>
<p>3. And poetry is more philosophical than history, because it regards <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ καθόλου</foreign>, but history <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ</foreign> KaO' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕκαϭτον</foreign>.</p><figure type="illustration">

<p>confined to the adventures of a few families.</p>
<p>6. Euripides, from his plots ending unhappily, is unduly blamed.</p>
<p>7. But a happy end pleases the weak feelings of the spectators, as also does the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διπλη̃ σύσταϭις</foreign>, where the play ends in a contrary result to the good and bad.</p>
<p>8. But this is better suited to comedy.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>—1. Scenic decoration may excite terror and pity, but they should rather arise <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ αὐτη̃ς τη̃ς συστάϭεως, τω̃ν πραγμάτων</foreign>, which is far better, and more suitable to the poet's art.</p>
<p>2. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄΨις</foreign> rather produces <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ τερατψ̃δες</foreign>.</p>
<p>4. Now, terrible actions must be either between friends, enemies, or persons indifferent. But if an enemy kill an enemy, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδἑν έλεεινὸν</foreign>, as also with indifferent persons. But it is between friends and relations that such events become piteous.</p>
<p>5. Now, we must not essentially alter the received subjects of tragedy, but we must invent new ones, and use the old judiciously.</p>
<p>6. Now, this may be done in the following ways: I. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰδότας καὶ γιγνώϭκοντας</foreign>, as Medea. 2. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγνοου̃νταςΤΟ</foreign> Set<foreign xml:lang="grc">νὸν, εἶθ̛</foreign> </p>
<pb n="484"/>
<figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig101.jpg"/></figure>
<p>And hence the development of a plot should arise out of the plot itself, not out of the machinery, which should be confined to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰτ ἔξω</foreign>rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">δράματος</foreign>, things happening before or after the time of action. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλογον μηδὲν εἶναι ἐν τοι̃ς πράγμαϭιν</foreign>, but if so, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξω τη̃ς, τραγωδίας</foreign>.</p>
<p>8. Like good painters, we must improve upon the original we imitate.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/> [Doubtful. The four kinds of discovery are, 1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ, διὰ τω̃νϭημείων</foreign>, and these are either <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭύμφυτα</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίκτητα</foreign>, which are the worst. 2. at <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεποιημἑναι ὑπὸ</foreign>rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιητου</foreign>, also
<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἄτεχνοι</foreign>. 3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ μνήμης</foreign>. 4. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ συλλογιϭμου̃</foreign>.</p>
<p>8. But the best is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ἐξ αὐτω̃ν τω̃ν πραγμάτων, τη̃ς ἐκπλήξεως γιγυομένης δἰ εἰκότων</foreign>. Next to it, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ἐκ ϭυλλογιϭμου̃</foreign>. ]</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>—1. The poet should put himself as much as possible in the place of a spectator.</p>
<p>2. And of an actor likewise, for he will best express agitation who feels it, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι' ὃἐυφυου̃ς ἡ ποιητική ἐϭτιν ἢ μανικου̃</foreign>.</p>
<p>3. He should first draw out a general sketch of the subject, then add the episodes, taking care that they belong properly to the subject. They are short in tragedy, but serve to lengthen out an epic poem.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/> [Doubtful. Every tragedy consists of two parts:</p>
<pb n="485"/>
<figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig102.jpg"/></figure>
<pb n="486"/>
<figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig103.jpg"/></figure>
<p>But heroic verse admits of all these kinds. Iambic should approach as much as possible to the diction of common life.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/> In narrative and hexameter verse, the story ought to be dramatically constructed, as in tragedy, i. e. it should be</p><figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig104.jpg"/></figure>
<p>from history, which treats of events of one time, not of one action.</p>
<p>3. Hence the excellent management of Homer in not attempting to bring the whole war into his poem, but only taking one part, filling it out with episodes.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/> The epic poem should also agree with the tragic as to its kinds [simple or complicated, moral or disastrous?]. Its parts are also the same, except <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελοποιΐα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄΨις</foreign>, for it must have <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιπετείαι,ἀναγνωρίϭεις, παθήματα, διανοίαι</foreign>, and</p>
<pb n="487"/>
<figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig105.jpg"/></figure>
<p>3. It also differs in length.</p>
<p>4. For it has the advantage of being extended by narrative of many simultaneous actions, which increase the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄγκοςτου̃ ποιήματος</foreign>, and also by different episodes.</p>
<p>5. Heroic is the established metre of narrative poetry, for it is <foreign xml:lang="grc">στασιμώτατον καὶ ὀγκωδέϭτατον</foreign>, but the Iambic and Trochaic
<foreign xml:lang="grc">κινητικα</foreign>, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν, ὀρχηϭτικόν</foreign>, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ, πρακτικόν</foreign>.</p>
<p>6. A mixture of these metres is absurd.</p>
<p>7. Like Homer, the poet should know when it is fitting for him to speak in person.</p>
<p>8. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαυμαϭτὸν</foreign> is necessary in tragedy, but in epopee even <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἄλογονι</foreign>s admitted, which is most wonderful, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὸ μὴ όρα̃ν εὶς τὸν πράττοντα</foreign>.</p>
<p>9. And Homer has chiefly taught other poets <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ψευδη̃λέγειν ὡς δει̃</foreign>, which is by a <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραλογιϭμός</foreign> on the part of the hearer.</p>
<p>10. And the poet should prefer <foreign xml:lang="grc">άδύνατα καὶεἰκότα, μα̃λλον</foreign> </p><figure type="illustration">
<graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig106.jpg"/></figure>
<p>TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυθεύματος</foreign>, as CEdipus' ignorance as to the manner of Laius' death.</p>
<p>11. And the diction should be most studied in the idle parts of the poem, where there are neither manners nor sentiment. For these latter are obscured by over-fine diction.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/> and XXVI. [ Very doubtful. As these two chapters are quite unintelligible, except in reference to the examples quoted, it is of little use to analyse them.]</p>
