          </head>
          <p>IN this third edition, the translation of Aristotle'is Rhe­ <lb/>
            toric has been again carefully compared with the Greek, <lb/>
            and revised and corrected throughout. Numerous ex­ <lb/>
            planatory and illustrative notes have also been added; <lb/>
            as well as a marginal analysis, which it is presumed will <lb/>
            be found of much service to the reader.</p>
          <p>The famous Thomas Hobbes' Brief of the Art of <lb/>
            Rhetorick, "containing in substance all that Aristotle <lb/>
            hath written in his three books on that subject," and <lb/>
            forming the best summary of this noble science, has <lb/>
            been again reprinted from the scarce edition published <lb/>
            at London in 1681. A body of Analytical Questions, <lb/>
            for self-examination, has also been appended.</p>
          <p>With these improvements, the Editor confidently <lb/>
            hopes that the present volume will be found to contain, <lb/>
            not only the most faithful version of the Rhetoric of <lb/>
            Aristotle, but the best helps for the due understanding <lb/>
            and retaining the sense thereo. <note type="footnote">Oxford, November, 1846. </note> </p>
          <p>IN the present new edition of the Oxford version of. the <lb/>
            Rhetoric, it has been thought advisable not to interfere <lb/>
            either with the text, notes, or Questions, all being of <lb/>
            acknowledged excellence. But, as Hobbes, by the <lb/>
             <pb n="iv"/>
            quaintness of his Analysis, at times lost sight of the <lb/>
            precise character of the original definitions, an Appen­ <lb/>
            dix has been added, containing the very words of <lb/>
            Aristotle, connected by such remarks as were necessary <lb/>
            to preserve clearness, and furnishing such passages as <lb/>
            should be almost learnt by heart.</p>
          <p>The new translation of the Poetic is an attempt to <lb/>
            unite the closeness of Taylor with the perspicuity of <lb/>
            Twining, upon whose versions it has principally been <lb/>
            based. A copious selection from the notes of the last <lb/>
            named scholar has been added, together with a few ne­ <lb/>
            cessary ones from recent sources by the present Editor,</p>

              this usage properly enough. For it is not right that <lb/>

              pleader's business is nothing more than to prove the <lb/>
              matter of fact, either that it is, or is not the case ; <lb/>

            in deliberative speeches it is less worth while to state <lb/>
            matters foreign to the subject, and a deliberative <lb/>
            speech admits less of malicious sophistry than judi­ <lb/>
            cial pleading, but is more widely interesting; for <lb/>
            here the judge [i. e. the senator] decides on questions <lb/>
            which nearly interest himself, so that no more is ne­ <lb/>

            ever, this is not sufficient, but it is worth while to <lb/>
            engage the hearer; for the decision is about a case <lb/>
            which does not affect himself: so that the judges, <lb/>
            looking to their own gratification, and listening with <lb/>
            a view to amusement, surrender themselves up to <lb/>
            the pleaders ; and, strictly speaking, do not fulfil the <lb/>

            consequent loss of all interest in deliberative questions, to men <lb/>
            whose future fates were totally out of their own power. </note><note type="footnote"> 14 A writer in the Quarterly Review, No. 26, after contrasting <lb/>
            the perplexity of English law with the simplicity of Athenian <lb/>
            jurisprudence, says, " This simplicity in the law made it the <lb/>
            orator's business less to hunt for cases and precedents than to <lb/>
            discriminate character; less to search for errors in a bill than <lb/>
            for flaws or errors in a witness's life or testimony. And the <lb/>
            prevalence of this practice may be inferred from a subsequent <lb/>
            passage in this book, (c. ix. § 38,) where Isocrates is mentioned <lb/>
            as an adept in the comparison of characters, " which," says <lb/>
            Aristotle, " he used to do to further his familiarity with judicial <lb/>
            pleading." To this we may subjoin the following remarks of <lb/>
            Mitford on a speech by Alcibiades: “ The multitude ordinarily <lb/>
            composing an Athenian court of justice was so great, that the <lb/>
            pleaders always addressed it as under the impulse of the same <lb/>
            interests, and subject to the same feelings as the general as­ <lb/>
            sembly, and equally without responsibility. Impartiality was <lb/>
            never supposed; the passions were always applied to; and it <lb/>
            never failed to be contended between the parties, which could <lb/>
            most persuade the jurors that their interest was implicated with <lb/>
            his, and that by deciding in his favour they would be gainers." <lb/>

            this is a sort of proof, (because we are then most per­ <lb/>

            proved,) but the proof of rhetoric is enthymem, (and <lb/>
            this, to speak generally, has the most sovereign effect <lb/>
            of all the means of persuasion ;) and the enthymem <lb/>
            is a sort of syllogism ; since too it is the province of <lb/>

            whether of that art as a whole, or of some particular <lb/>

            will moreover be in the highest degree capable of <lb/>
            employing enthymems ; provided he make himself <lb/>
            acquainted, besides his logic, with the kind of sub­ <lb/>
            jects about which enthymems are conversant, and <lb/>
            what differences they exhibit as compared with the <lb/>
            syllogism of logic. Because it belongs to the same <lb/>
            faculty of the mind to recognise both truth and the <lb/>
            semblance, of truth ; and more thanthis, mankind <lb/>
            have a15 tolerable natural tendency toward that which <lb/>
            is true; and, in general, bit the truth; wherefore an <lb/>
            aptness in conjecturing probabilities belongs to birD <lb/>
            who hasa similar aptness in regard to truth. It is <lb/>
            plain, then, that other rhetoricians embrace in their <lb/>
            systems, points foreign to the subject, and what rea­ <lb/>

            to logic. Each, he says, is founded on a faculty naturally pos­ <lb/>
            sessed by all men; each is useful, and applicable with equal <lb/>
            propriety to any class of subjects whatever. Besides this, lo­ <lb/>
            gic and rhetoric alone, of all arts, are equally conversant with <lb/>
            opposite inferences; and of course with sound and specious <lb/>
            arguments (whether in the form of syllogism or enthymem). <lb/>
            Now as logic and rhetoric are in their own nature indifferent <lb/>
            to truth or falsehood, it must require an act of choice in either <lb/>
            case to select the former or the latter, and the constant repeti­ <lb/>
            tion of that choice will ultimately form a corresponding habit. <lb/>
            Hence the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλεκτικὸς</foreign> may be considered as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνάμει σοφιστὴς</foreign>, <lb/>
            and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφιστὴς</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνάμει διαλεκτὸς</foreign>. But when logic is <lb/>
            prostituted to the support of false propositions, by the bad <lb/>
            principles (the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρσαὶρεσις</foreign>) of its professors, it is branded with <lb/>
            the name of sophistry, and the persons who so misapply it are <lb/>
            called sophists: whereas, in the case of rhetoric, no such dis­ <lb/>
            tinction in reference to the principles of its professors ever ob­ <lb/>
            tained ; but the name of orator is enjoyed equally by all who <lb/>

            arts, each of which is fit enough to inform or persuade <lb/>
            respecting its own subject; medicine, for instance, <lb/>

            causes it is engendered, and how : so that the fact is, <lb/>
            that rhetoric is, as it were, a kind of off-shoot of logic, <lb/>
            and of that department of moral philosophy which it <lb/>
            is fair to call the science of social life 3. Whence rhe­ <lb/>

            as well as its professors, partly from inexperience, <lb/>
            partly arrogance, and in part from other human <lb/>
            causes ; because, as I stated at the outset, it is a sort <lb/>
            of subordinate division of logic, and portraiture of it; <lb/>
            neither of them being a science of any one definite <note type="footnote"> 3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιτικὴ</foreign>. For an explanation of this term-an enumer­ <lb/>

            the display of his persuasive powers, other than the ordinary <lb/>
            course of affairs presents, would be accused of great arrogance <lb/>
            were he to talk of having exercised rhetoric. Now Aristotle, <lb/>
            so far from holding a person guilty of presumption for such an <lb/>
            use of the term, would rather retort on the accuser the charge <lb/>
            of ignorance of its true import. For with a view to invest their <lb/>
            art, and of consequence themselves, with an air of dignity, the <lb/>
            professors of rhetoric, said he, would have the world think <lb/>
            (some of them, poor creatures, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαιδευσιαν</foreign>) that it was ap­ <lb/>
            plicable exclusively to such cases as are of high concernment <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">διότι</foreign> of Aristotle) he takes to be an a priori argu­ <lb/>
            ment, which may be employed to account for the fact supposed <lb/>

              strict logical relation of universal to particular, or of a generic <lb/>
              law to its application in an individual instance. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign> <lb/>
              therefore is the major premiss, not the minor. </note><note type="footnote"> We see that the universal major in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign> enthymem <lb/>
              cannot be the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign> itself, because it is detached from any <lb/>

              yet is this major, though universal, an <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign>, being <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁπλῶς</foreign> and <lb/>
              totally true, which is inconsistent with the very meaning of <lb/>

              conclusion. Still there is so much affinity between the minor <lb/>
              premiss of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign> enthymem, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνὡνυμον σημεῖον</foreign>, that <lb/>
              by converting the major premiss, with the addition of the word <lb/>
              " probably" to the copula, we shall change the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign> into <lb/>
              an <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign> of low degree: e. g. <lb/>
              All who have a fever breathe <lb/>
              hard. <lb/>
              This man breathes hard. <lb/>
              This man has a fever. <lb/>
              Those who breathe hard pro­ <lb/>

              This man breathes hard. <lb/>
              This man probably has a fever. <lb/>
              And this affinity perhaps led Quintilian to confound Aristotle'a <lb/>

              kind of " sign" and the argument deducible from it, which <lb/>
              constitutes what, in criminal cases, is called circumstantial <lb/>
              evidence. </note><note type="footnote"> Aristotle mentions another sort of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign> (§ 18) which <lb/>
              comes out a syllogism in the third figure, with an universal <lb/>
              conclusion, and hence its error is an illicit process of the mi­ <lb/>
              nor term. The principle on which this syllogism proceeds is <lb/>
              an imperfect, precarious induction, and endeavours to deduce <lb/>
              a general truth from a particular instance. The ratio, there­ <lb/>
              fore, of the sign to the thing signified, is as one to all. This, <lb/>

              would have it stand in such a relation to the conclusion to be <lb/>
              drawn, as an universal to a particular. For instance, the </note><note type="footnote">C 2 </note> <pb n="20"/>

              supposing the premiss stated to be true ; for it vio­ <lb/>
              lates the rules of syllogism, as to the other, when, <lb/>
              for instance, a person alleges as a sign that a man is <lb/>
              sick, his being in a fever ; or says a woman has had <lb/>

              cannot be done away. The other sign is in the ratio <lb/>
              of an universal to a particular ; as if, for instance, <note type="footnote"> Corinthians at Athens state as an <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign>, that the Corcyræans <lb/>

              the one case happens to be better known than the <lb/>

              because Pisistratus before him, when designing this, <lb/>

              established himself as tyrant; so too did Theogenes, <lb/>

            propositions, conversant with each species and genus <lb/>
            of subjects; for instance, there are propositions on <lb/>

            natural philosophy; this is also the case equally on <lb/>
            every subject. Now the first-mentioned reasonings <lb/>
            (the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόποι</foreign>) will render a man informed on no class of <lb/>
            subjects, for they are about no distinct subject-matter: <lb/>
            as to the other (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴδια</foreign>), the orator, in proportion as he <lb/>
            makes the better 18 selection of propositions peculiar, <lb/>
            will imperceptibly produce a science different from <lb/>
            mere rhetoric or logic19 ; for, if he light on first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, thenceforth, it will no longer be rhetoric or <lb/>
            logic which he is employing, but that science whose <lb/>

          <p>The greatest number of enthymems are constructed <note type="chapter"> 22. </note> <lb/>

            I make a distinction of the peculiar20 propositions and <lb/>
            places of enthymems, whence we are to deduce them. <lb/>
            Now I mean by <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδη</foreign>, those propositions which are <lb/>
            peculiar to the several kindsof rhetoric; by <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόποι</foreign>, <lb/>
            those which are common alike to all. Let us then <note type="margin"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδη</foreign> first <lb/>

            THE species of rhetoric are three in number, for of <lb/>
            so many descriptions are the hearers of orations; be­ <lb/>
            cause an oration is constituted of three things, of the <lb/>
            speaker, and of the subject about which he speaks, <lb/>
            and of the person to whom; and to him it is that <lb/>
            the end of the speech has its reference ;I mean to <lb/>
            the hearer.TheTiearer must of necessity be either <lb/>
            an unconcerned hearer, or a judge; and a judge <lb/>
            either of things past or to come; one then acts as <lb/>
            judge respecting what is yet to happen, as the mem­ <lb/>
            her of a popular assembly; the other respecting what <lb/>
            has already taken place, as the president of a court <lb/>
            of justice; the other respecting the abilities of the <note type="margin"> 3. Hence <lb/>
            three <lb/>
            kinds of <lb/>
            rhetoric; <lb/>

            orator, as the unconcerned hearer1. Thus, then, <lb/>
            there will necessarily result three kinds of orations, <lb/>
            the deliberative, judicial, and demonstrative2. The <lb/>
            business of deliberation is partly exhortation, partly. <lb/>
            dissuasion ; for invariably those who in their indivi­ <lb/>
            dual capacities simply advise, and those who publicly <lb/>
            harangue, effect one of these objects. The business <lb/>
            of judicial rhetoric is partly accusation, partly de­ <lb/>
            fence; for the litigants must of course do one or the <lb/>
            other of these things. Of demonstrative the busi- <note type="margin"> 4. Time </note> <lb/>
            ness is partly praise, partly blame. Moreover the <note type="footnote"> 21 Cf. lib. ii. c. 22, § 13: <foreign xml:lang="grc">στοιχει̃ον δὲ λέλω καὶ τόπον ἐνθυ­ <lb/>

            time proper to each of these respectively is, to the <lb/>
            deliberative orator, the future; for in exhorting or <lb/>
            dissuading, he advises respecting thingsfuture3. The <lb/>
            time proper to a judicial pleader is thepast;for it <lb/>
            is ever on the subject of actions already that <lb/>
            tEe one party accuses, and the other defends. To <lb/>
            the demonstrative orator the present time is the most <lb/>
            appropriate, for it is in reference to qualities actually <lb/>
            possessed that all eithr praise or blame.Orators, <lb/>
            however, do very frequently avail themselves of <lb/>
            other times; as well by awakening a recollection of <lb/>
            what has already happened, as by anticipating what <lb/>
            is likely to happen. The end of each of these <note type="margin"> 5. and end <lb/>

            branches is different, and, as belonging to three sub­ <lb/>
            jects, is itself triple.*</p>
          <p>The object of the deliberative orator is the expe-* <lb/>
            dient and inexpedient; for he who recommends, ad­ <lb/>
            vises you to adopt the better measure; but he who <lb/>
            dissuades, diverts you from the worse; the other <lb/>
            considerations either of justice and injustice, of <lb/>
            honour or disgrace, he adjoins by the way, in addi­ <lb/>
            tion to these two. The object of the judicial pleader <lb/>
            is justice and injustice; but he also embraces by the <lb/>
            way those oTher considerations. The object of those <lb/>
            praise andblame is honour and disgrace ; and <lb/>
            these also refer other considerations to tHese two.</p>
          <p>But we may take as a sign that what I have stated <note type="margin"> 6. Proof <lb/>
            of this <lb/>

            are times when they will not feel inclined even to <lb/>

            would there be no need of a judicial decision. In the <lb/>
            same way the deliberative orator very often aban­ <lb/>
            dons the other considerations ; but as to the point <lb/>
            that he is advising what is disadvantageous, or dis­ <lb/>
            suading from what is useful, this will he never admit; <lb/>
            but it frequently happens that (on a question of in­ <lb/>
            vasion) they do not trouble themselves to make out <lb/>
            that the subjugating a neighbouring people is not in­ <lb/>
            consistent with justice. Just so those who praise <lb/>
            and blame do not consider whether the person's con­ <lb/>
            duct has been advantageous or disadvantageous ; nay, <lb/>
            they, in many instances, set it down on the score of <lb/>
            praise, that, overlooking his own interests, he wrought <lb/>
            some deed of honour : thus they praise Achilles, be­ <lb/>
            cause he came to aid the cause of his comrade Pa­ <lb/>
            troclus, with full knowledge that himself was fated <lb/>
            to die ; it being in his power, [by withholding that <lb/>
            aid,] to live. To him, however, a death such as this <lb/>
            was the more honourable prize : but to live would <lb/>
            have been advantageous.</p>

              to get up logic or rhetoric, not as they are general <lb/>
              faculties, but as distinct sciences, he will unwittingly <lb/>
              do away their nature by his encroaching, in the act <lb/>
              of so tricking them out, upon sciences of certain defi­ <lb/>
              nite subject-matter, and not of words alone. Let us, <lb/>
              however, even on the present occasion, discuss such <lb/>
              points as it is worth while to enlarge upon, and <lb/>
              which still reserve the more full consideration for <lb/>
              the science of social life: for nearly all the questions <lb/>
              on which men deliberate and on which the delibera­ <lb/>
              tive orator harangues, those at least of the highest <lb/>
              concernment, are in number five6; and these are <lb/>
              questions of finance, of war andpeace, and again re­ <lb/>

              ture.</p>
          <p>So that it will be fitting that the orator, who is <lb/>
            about to give his advice on the subject of the finance <lb/>
            of the state, be acquainted with its revenues, both <note type="footnote"> 5 The analytical science seems to have been the analysis of <lb/>

            carry that on, fixed revenues (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόροι</foreign>) are requisite. We may <lb/>
            observe, then, a regular gradation in these five questions; <lb/>
            though in his examination of them Aristotle proceeds analy­ <lb/>
            tically, and takes that which first presents itself in civilized <lb/>
            society ; namely, the ways and means. Xenophon also, in his <lb/>
            Memorabilia, represents Socrates as using nearly the same five <lb/>
            subjects and arrangement, when dissuading Glaucon, a young <lb/>
            Athenian, from attempting politics too early. Perhaps Aris. <lb/>
            totle may have borrowed the hint from him. Cf. Xenoph. <lb/>

            Moreover he should be acquainted with the whole <lb/>

            points which we must not only learn from our own <lb/>

            War and <lb/>
            peace. </note> Respecting questions of war and peace, the orator <lb/>
            must needs be acquainted with the force of the state, <lb/>
            how great it actually is already, and how great it <lb/>
            admits of becoming; of what description also it is <lb/>
            already, and what additions admit of being made to <lb/>
            it. Moreover he should know both what wars the <lb/>
            state has been engaged in, and how it has conducted <lb/>
            them. This must he needs know, not in relation to <lb/>
            his own state only, but as regards frontier states <lb/>
            also; particularly in the case of those with whom <lb/>
            there is a likelihood of being at war, in order that <lb/>
            toward the more powerful, pacific measures may be <lb/>
            held, and that in regard to the weaker, it may rest <lb/>
            with his own state to make war or not. He should <lb/>
            also be acquainted with the description of force which <lb/>
            belongs to each state, whether it resemble or differ? <lb/>
            from his own; for it is possible, even in this respect, <lb/>
            to secure an advantage to yourself, or to have one <lb/>
            taken by the enemy. In order to all which things, <lb/>
            the orator must necessarily have considered with at­ <lb/>
            tention the wars, not of his own state only, but those <lb/>
            also of others, what has been their issue; for it is <lb/>
            natural that from similar causes similar results should <lb/>
            accrue. <note type="footnote"> 7 See this point touched on by Pericles, Thucyd. i. 141, <lb/>

            the positions of the strong holds: this it is impossi­ <lb/>

            thing (that's worth mentioning at least) beyond their <lb/>

            enjoyment of the property is one's own. The essen­ <lb/>

            number both of the excellencies of the body and of <lb/>
            fortune. For one who is neither unmolested by sick­ <lb/>

            2. and for the sake of which we choose something <lb/>

            every thing would aim at, were it possessed of intel­ <lb/>

            must be distinctly treated. It must be also that <lb/>
            pleasure is a good, for all living things naturally de­ <lb/>

            the enjoyment of the consequent is inherent in the <lb/>
            enjoyment of the other. Things are consequent si­ <lb/>

            greater degree [than itself], are greater6; for of ne- <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            cessity they exceed even the greater. T hings produc­ <lb/>

            by virtue of their being productive of something <lb/>
            greater. That, too, the productive cause of which is <lb/>

            healthy, be preferable to, and a greater good than, <lb/>
            that which is pleasant; then also will health be su- <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>

            a less degree stands in need of any one or more things <lb/>
            as accessions, for it is in a higher degree independent: <lb/>
            now that is said less to need accessions, which needs <lb/>
            such as either are fewer or more easily obtained. <lb/>
            And whenever one thing does not exist, nor can pos- <note type="chapter">11. </note> <lb/>

            ther, but that other can without it; then that which <lb/>
            needs not the accession, is more independent, and thus <lb/>
            shows itself to be a greater good. Again, if one be <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            a principle and the other not; and for the same rea­ <lb/>
            son, if one be a cause, the other not; since without a <lb/>
            cause or principle, existence or production is impos­ <lb/>
            sible8. And of goods both proceeding from princi­ <lb/>
            ples, that is the greater good which arises from the <lb/>
            higher principle; as also that is the greater good which <lb/>
            originates in the higher of two causes. And, vice <lb/>
            versa, that of two principles which is the principle of <lb/>
            the greater good, is greater ; and that of two causes <lb/>
            which is the cause of the greater, is itself greater. <lb/>

            deviser; for had there not been an agent, it would <lb/>

            withstanding that it is less useful; for the acquisition, <lb/>
            by reason of its being more difficult, is greater. And <lb/>
            in another view, the abundant is better than the rare, <lb/>
            for the enjoy ment of ---It exceeds that of the other; <lb/>
            for the idea of often exceeds that of seldom; whence <note type="chapter">15. </note> <lb/>
            it is said, "Water12 is the best of things : and, in a <lb/>
            word, the more difficult is superior to the easier ac­ <lb/>
            quisition, for it is more rare. In another point of <lb/>
            view, the easier is above the more difficult; for it has <note type="chapter">16. </note> <lb/>
            itself as we wish. That also is the greater good, the <lb/>
            contrary of which is the greater evil; as is also that <lb/>
            of which the deprivation is the greater loss. Virtue, <lb/>
            too, is greater than what is not positive virtue, and <lb/>
            vice than what is not positive vice; for the former <note type="chapter">17. </note> <lb/>
            severally are ends, the latter are not ends. Causes, <lb/>
            the productions of which are more becoming or more <lb/>

            encies are of greater importance, of them are also <lb/>
            the productions of greater importance: since results <lb/>

            for sight is preferable to smelling; and the being <lb/>
            greatly attached to friends is more becoming than to <lb/>
            be greatly attached to money13, so that attachment <lb/>
            to friends is more becoming than fondness for money. <lb/>
            And conversely, too, the excesses of better feelings are <lb/>
            themselves better: and of the more becoming, them­ <lb/>
            selves, more becoming: as, too, are those things of <note type="chapter"> 19. </note> <lb/>
            which the desires are better or more becoming; tor <lb/>
            the greater desire is of the greater object: and, for <lb/>

            excellent and becoming objects, are themselves more <lb/>
            excellent and becoming. Again, where the sciences <note type="chapter"> 20. </note> <lb/>

            must be such, either absolutely, or so far at least as <lb/>

            being, if fraught with prudence14, would choose; <lb/>
            wherefore it is evident, that what prudence pronounces <note type="chapter"> 22. </note> <lb/>
            good in a high degree is a greater good. Also that <lb/>
            which belongs to the better men, either absolutely, or <lb/>
            in respect of their being better; as courage is better <lb/>
            than strength. Also what the better man would <lb/>
            make the object of his choice, either absolutely or in <lb/>
            respect of its being better; as, the suffering rather <lb/>
            than the doing an injury, for this would he choose <note type="chapter"> 23. </note> <lb/>
            who is more just. And that which conduces more to <lb/>
            pleasure rather that what conduces less; because <lb/>
            every being pursues pleasure, and is desirous of en­ <lb/>
            joying it for its own sake; now it is in reference to <lb/>
            this, that the good and the end have been defined: <lb/>
            that is said to conduce more to pleasure, which is <lb/>
            conducive to it with less alloy of pain, and for a <note type="chapter"> 24. </note> <lb/>
            greater length of time. That which is more becom­ <lb/>
            ing rather than what is less so; for the becoming ei­ <lb/>
            ther is that which tends to please, or is desirable on <note type="chapter"> 25. </note> <lb/>
            its own account. Whatever things people prefer <lb/>
            being the causes of to themselves or to their friends, <lb/>
            those are greater goods; but whatever they would <note type="chapter"> 26. </note> <lb/>
            least wish, are greater evils. Things whose duration <lb/>
            is long, rather than those whose duration is short; <lb/>
            and those which are more secure, rather than those <lb/>
            which are less so: for there is an advantage in their <lb/>
            enjoyment; of the former, in respect to time; of the <lb/>
            latter, from their being at will: for the enjoyment <lb/>
            of what is secure is more in their power whenever <note type="chapter">27. </note> <lb/>
            they wish. And as are the terms arising from con­ <lb/>
            jugates and similar inflections, so are the qualities <lb/>
            they denote; for example, if courageously be an idea <lb/>
            more noble and desirable than temperately, courage <lb/>
            will also be something more noble than temperance, <lb/>
            and the idea of a man's being courageous than of his <note type="chapter">28. </note> <lb/>
            being temperate. What every one chooses is better <lb/>
            than what some do not, as also is the choice of a ma­ <lb/>
            jority better than that of a minority; for as that was <lb/>
            supposed a good which all desire, so that is propor- <note type="footnote"> 14 Whence it follows that prudence is competent to decide <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            tionately greater which is more desired. That, too, <lb/>
            which litigants or foes, judges, or arbitrators selected <lb/>
            by judges, prefer, is better ; for in one case the deci­ <lb/>
            sion is equivalent to that of all mankind; and in the <lb/>
            other, men of authority and information actually do <lb/>
            pronounce. And sometimes good is greater in which <note type="chapter"> 29. </note> <lb/>
            all participate; tor not to participate in it is a dis­ <lb/>
            grace : while at others, that is which none, or which <lb/>
            few share with you; for it is more rare. Things <note type="chapter"> 30. </note> <lb/>
            more commended, because more becoming; and in <lb/>
            the same way things are better to which belongs the <lb/>
            greater honour, because honour is as a kind of esti­ <lb/>
            mate of worth. Those things again are more hein­ <lb/>
            ous on which are imposed the greater punishments. <lb/>
            Again, what is greater than things confessedly or ap- <note type="chapter"> 31. </note> <lb/>
            parently great, is itself superior in greatness. And <lb/>
            the same objects, when separated into their several <lb/>
            constituents, have an air of superior greatness, for <lb/>
            the excess of a plurality of objects is conspicuous. <lb/>
            Whence the poet says that Meleager's wife persuaded <lb/>
            him to rise up to the war by entering into detail:­ <lb/>
            " She paints the horrors of a conquer'd town, <lb/>
            The heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown, <lb/>
            The matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved15." <lb/>
            Iliad ix. 705. <lb/>
            Again, the condensing and accumulating of circum­ <lb/>
            stances in the way Epicharmus used to do, is produc­ <lb/>
            tive of effect, and that on the same principle as their <lb/>
            separation; viz. because the condensing of them <lb/>
            evinces great excess, and for the further reason, that <lb/>
            it appears a principle and a cause of great results. <lb/>
            But as that is greater which is more rare and difficult, <note type="chapter"> 32. </note> <lb/>
            circumstances both of opportunity, and age, and <lb/>
            place, and time, and strength, produce great effect. <lb/>
            15 Another striking instance of the effect produced by a de­ <lb/>
            tail of circumstances may be found in the Septem contra <lb/>

              which is innate is superior to what is adscititious, <lb/>
              from its greater difficulty; wherefore the poet says, <note type="chapter"> 34. </note> <lb/>

              just as the spring, were it to be withdrawn from the <note type="chapter"> 35. </note> <lb/>
              year. That, too, is more precious which is available <lb/>
              in the greater need; as in old age, or sickness, for <lb/>
              instance. And of two means, that more immediately <lb/>

              it to appear, than merely to exist21 : in respect to <lb/>
              health, however, this is not the case. That which <note type="chapter"> 38. </note> <lb/>
              is conducive to the greater number of uses; as what <lb/>
              conduces to life, to happy life, to pleasure, and to <lb/>
              noble conduct; wherefore health and wealth appear <lb/>
              the highest goods, for these include everything. <lb/>
              That which is accompanied by less pain, and on <note type="chapter"> 39. </note> <lb/>
              which pleasure is attendant; for the good is more <lb/>
              than merely single, since it is realised both in the <lb/>
              positive pleasure, and in the absence of pain. And <lb/>
              of two goods, that which, added to the same good, <lb/>
              renders the sum greater. That, too, whose presence <note type="chapter"> 40. </note> <lb/>

              good :-whether, as in some cases, it be single; or, as <lb/>

              of a suggestion ; but thus, of commendation, " think­ <lb/>
              ing highly, not of goods which were his by chance, <lb/>
              but those obtained by his own means." So that, <lb/>
              when you wish to commend, see what you would <lb/>
              suggest in advising; and when to advise, see what <lb/>
              you would commend. But the diction will of neces- <note type="chapter"> 37. </note> <lb/>
              sity be reversed, when there has been submitted to <lb/>
              change an idea which in one form is prohibitive, in <lb/>
              another is not prohibitive.</p>

            many cases: thus, if a man has done a thing alone, <lb/>
            or first, or with few to share it, or even if it be a <lb/>

            whatandhow many are the objects forthe sake of <lb/>
            which men act unjustly; the second, how themselves <lb/>
            are disposed; the third, towards personsofwhat <lb/>
            character and of what disposition they do so act.</p>
          <p>Let us then, after defining the acting unjustly, <lb/>
            speak in order of the rest. Let the acting unjustly <lb/>
            be defined to be, the voluntary1 commission of hurt <lb/>
            in contravention of law. Now law is either general <lb/>
            or peculiar. The peculiar law I call that, by whose <lb/>
            written enactments men direct their polity: the <lb/>
            general, whatever unwritten rules appear to be recog­ <lb/>
            nised among all men. Men are voluntary agents in <lb/>
            whatever they do wittingly, and without compulsion. <lb/>
            Men, therefore, do not every thing on fixed princi­ <lb/>
            ple, which they do wittingly: but whatever they do <lb/>
            on fixed principle, that they do wittingly; because <lb/>

            all men do all things either of themselves, or not of <lb/>
            themselves. The things which they do not of them­ <lb/>
            selves, they do either by chance, or from necessity ; <lb/>
            and the things done by necessity, they do either by <lb/>
            compulsion, or by nature. So that all things what­ <lb/>
            soever which men do not of themselves, they do either <lb/>
            by chance, or from compulsion, or by nature. Again, <lb/>
            the things which they do of themselves, and of which <lb/>
            they are themselves the causes, some they do through <lb/>
            custom, and others through natural desire ; and this <lb/>

            any thing other than what he conceives to be a good. <lb/>

            cessarily do from seven causes ; by chance, compul­ <lb/>
            sion, nature, custom, will, anger, or appetite. But <lb/>
            to carry on distinctions in reference to age, or habits, <lb/>
            or whatever else enacts itself in conduct, were su­ <lb/>
            perfluous. For, granting that it happens to young <lb/>
            men to be passionate, it is not by motion of their <lb/>
            youth that they act thus, but by motion of anger and <lb/>
            appetite: neither is it by motion either of wealth or <lb/>
            poverty, simply, but (in the case of the poor) it is on <lb/>
            account of their neediness that it happens that they <lb/>
            cherish an appetite for wealth; and (in the case of <lb/>
            the rich) on account of their having the means, that <lb/>
            they risk an appetite for unnecessary pleasure ; and <lb/>
            these persons will act neither by motion of their <lb/>
            wealth nor of their poverty, but by motion of appe­ <lb/>
            tite. And in exactly the same way, the just and un­ <lb/>
            just, and all such as are said to act conformably to <lb/>
            habits, will in reality act, under all circumstances, by <lb/>
            motion of these principles ; for they on the impulse <lb/>
            either of reason or of passion; but some from good <lb/>
            manners and passions, others from the contrary. <lb/>
            Still, however, it happens that on habits of this par- <note type="chapter"> 10. </note> <lb/>
            ticular character, principles of action the same in <pb n="70"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            character are consequent; and on those of that kind, <lb/>
            principles also of that kind. For on the temperate <lb/>
            man perhaps forthwith, by motion of his temper­ <lb/>
            ance, are attendant good opinions and appetites re­ <lb/>
            specting pleasures ; but on the intemperate, the con- <note type="chapter"> 11. </note> <lb/>
            trary on these same subjects. For which reason we <lb/>
            must wave distinctions of such a kind; but we must <lb/>
            consider, on what conditions4, what principles of <lb/>
            conduct are wont to follow: for it is not ordained, <lb/>
            (in the nature of things,) that, if a man be white or <lb/>
            black, or tall or short, principles of this or that kind <lb/>
            should be attendant on him; but if he be young or <lb/>
            old, just or unjust, here some difference begins ; and <lb/>
            so, in a word, in the case of all contingent circum­ <lb/>
            stances whatever, which produce a difference in the <lb/>
            tempers of men, for instance, a man's seeming to <lb/>
            himself to be rich or poor, fortunate or unfortunate; <lb/>
            in all these cases there will be some essential differ­ <lb/>
            ence. Of this, however, we will speak hereafter; let <note type="chapter"> 12. </note><note type="margin"> i. Chance. </note> <lb/>
            us now treat first of the remaining points. Things <lb/>
            proceed from chance which are of such kind that <lb/>
            their cause is not definite5, and are produced in the ab­ <lb/>
            sence of any final motive, and that neither invariably, <lb/>
            nor usually, nor in any prescribed order. My mean­ <lb/>
            ing on these subjects will be plain from the definition <note type="chapter"> 13. </note><note type="margin"> ii. Na­ <lb/>
            ture. </note> <lb/>
            of chance. All those thingsexist naturallywhose <lb/>
            cause is internal and ordinate; for they turn out, either <lb/>
            invariably or generally, in the same way; since there <lb/>
            is no need of an accurate inquiry on results contrary to <lb/>
            nature, whether they be produced conformably to a <lb/>
            certain nature, or any other cause. It would appear, <note type="chapter"> 14. </note><note type="margin"> iii. Com­ <lb/>

            is by reason of such their usefulness that they are real­ <lb/>
            ized in action: for even the intemperate do some things <lb/>
            which are useful; but not on account of their useful­ <lb/>

            of anger and excited feeling arise acts of vengeance. <lb/>
            Now, between revenge and punishment there is a dif­ <lb/>

            but revenge for that of the person inflicting it, in or­ <lb/>
            der that he may be satiated6. On what subjects this <lb/>
            excitement of feeling exists, will therefore be plain in <lb/>

            pear pleasant are produced in action on the impulse <lb/>
            of appetite. But that which is familiar and has be­ <lb/>
            come habitual, is of the number of things pleasant; <lb/>
            for many things there are, even among such as are <lb/>
            not pleasant naturally, which, when men have been <lb/>
            habituated to, they do with pleasure. So that, to <note type="margin"> These <lb/>

            in whatever they do of their own motion, and invo­ <lb/>

            all things whatsoever in respect to which they act <lb/>

            It must be also that a state of sedulous attention, <lb/>

            painful, for they all are acts of necessity, and con­ <lb/>

            custom which, under such circumstances, renders <lb/>

            in the class of things pleasant; for none of these has <lb/>

            which there is an innate appetite, is pleasant; for <lb/>

            plain that they who exercise memory or hope, cer­ <lb/>
            tainly feel pleasure, since they have also a perception. <lb/>
            So that every thing pleasant consists either in the <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            perception of present objects, or in the remembrance <lb/>
            of those which have already been, or in the hope of <lb/>

            on present, memory on past, and hope on future ob- <note type="chapter"> 8. </note> <lb/>
            jects. Now the objects of memory are pleasant, not <lb/>
            only such as at the moment while present were <lb/>
            pleasant, but some even which were not pleasant, <lb/>
            should their consequence subsequently be honour­ <lb/>
            able and good ; and hence this saying, " But it is <lb/>
            indeed pleasant for a man, when preserved, to re­ <lb/>
            member his toils ;" and this, " For after his suffer­ <lb/>
            ings, a man who has suffered much, and much <lb/>
            achieved, is gladdened at the recollection." But the <lb/>
            reason of this is, that to be exempt from evil is <note type="chapter"> 9. </note> <lb/>
            pleasant1. And all objects are pleasant in hope, <lb/>
            which appear by their presence either to delight or <lb/>
            benefit in a great degree ; or to benefit, without <lb/>
            giving pain. In a word, whatever objects by their <lb/>
            presence delight us, do so, generally speaking, as we <lb/>
            hope for, or remember them. On which account, <lb/>
            too, the feeling of anger is pleasant; just as Homer <lb/>
            has remarked of anger in his poem, " That which <lb/>
            with sweetness far greater than distilling honey as <lb/>
            it drops for there is no one who feels anger where <lb/>
            the object seems impracticable to his revenge ; nor <lb/>
            with those far their superiors in power do men feel <lb/>
            anger at all, or if they do, it is in a less degree. <note type="chapter"> 10. </note> <lb/>
            There is also a kind of pleasure consequent on most <lb/>
            appetites; for either in the recollection that they <lb/>
            have enjoyed them, or in the hope that they shall <lb/>
            enjoy them, men are affected and delighted by a <lb/>
            certain pleasure: thus men possessed by fevers feel <lb/>
            delight, amid their thirst, as well at the remembrance <lb/>
            how they used to drink, as at the hope of drinkinsr <note type="chapter"> 11. </note> <lb/>
             <lb/>
            yet again. Lovers, too, feel delight in conversing, <lb/>
            writing, and composing something, ever about the <lb/>
            object beloved ; because, in all those energies, they <lb/>
            have a perception, as it were, of the object they love. <note type="margin"> Criterion <lb/>

            And this is in all cases a criterion of the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of love, when persons feel pleasure not only in <lb/>
            the presence of the object, but are enamoured also of <note type="margin"> 12. Sor­ <lb/>

            pain arises at absence, nay in the midst of mourning, <lb/>
            and the very dirge of death, there yet arises within <lb/>
            us a certain pleasure. For the pain is felt because <lb/>
            the object is not present; but the pleasure consists in <lb/>
            remembering and seeing, as it were, both the person, <lb/>
            and what he used to do, and the kind of character of <lb/>
            which he was. Whence has it been said, and with <lb/>
            probability enough, "Thus spake he, and excited <lb/>
            within them all a desire of lamentation." Also the <note type="margin"> 13. Re­ <lb/>

            avenging one's self is pleasant2; for the getting of that <lb/>
            is pleasant, the failing to get which is painful: now <lb/>
            the angry do feel pain in an excessive degree if they <lb/>
            be not avenged ; but in the hope of revenge they take <lb/>
            pleasure. Again, to overcome is pleasant, not to the <note type="margin"> 14. Vie­ <lb/>
            tory. </note> <lb/>
            ambitious only, but even to all; for there arises an <lb/>
            imagination of superiority, for which all, either in a <lb/>
            faint or more violent degree, have an appetite. But <note type="margin"> 15.Hence, <lb/>

            ments. </note> <lb/>
            since to overcome is pleasant, it must follow of <lb/>
            course, that amusements where there is field for <lb/>
            rivalry, as those of music and disputations, are plea­ <lb/>
            sant ; for it frequently occurs, in the course of these, <lb/>
            that we overcome; also chess, ball, dice, and draughts. <lb/>
            Again, it is the same with respect to amusements <lb/>
            where a lively interest is taken3; for, of these, some <lb/>
            become pleasant as accustomed to them; others are <lb/>
            pleasant at first; for instance, hunting and every <lb/>
            kind of sporting ; for where there is rivalry, there <lb/>
            is also victory; on which principle the disputations <lb/>
            of the bar and of the schools are pleasant to those <lb/>
            who have become accustomed to them, and have <lb/>
            abilities. Also honour and good character are most <note type="margin"> 16. Hon­ <lb/>

            pleasant, by reason that an idea arises, that one is <lb/>
            such as is the good man ; and this in a greater de­ <lb/>

            he think speaks truth: such are those immediately <lb/>

            the opposite characters will: since one has no anxiety <lb/>

            greatly despises, children and animals for instance, <lb/>
            not at least for the sake of such opinion itself; but <lb/>

            Friends. </note> <lb/>
            something else. A friend, too, ranks among things <lb/>
            pleasant; for the affection of love is pleasant; since <lb/>
            there is no lover of wine, who does not delight in <lb/>
            wine: also the having affection felt toward one is <lb/>
            pleasant; for there is in this case also an idea of one's <lb/>
            being an excellent person, which all who have any <lb/>
            sensibility to it are desirous of; now' the having <lb/>
            affection felt for you is the being beloved yourself, <note type="margin"> 18. Being <lb/>

            friend4. To continue the same course of action is <lb/>
            also pleasant; for what is habitual was laid down to <lb/>
            be pleasant. To vary is also pleasant; for change is <lb/>
            an approach to what is natural: for sameness pro­ <lb/>
            duces an excess of a stated habit; whence it has <lb/>
            been said, " In every thing change is pleasant5." <lb/>
            For on this principle, whatever occurs at intervals <lb/>
            of time is pleasant, whether persons or things; for <note type="footnote"> 4 It may be interesting to compare the grounds on which <lb/>
            Dr. Johnson considered flattery pleasant with these of Aris­ <lb/>

            to be true; but, in the second place, whether he thinks so or <lb/>

            is desired: and in the act of learning there is a set­ <lb/>

            things, the both of which men desire. And because <lb/>

            ginal object, of which it is the imitation, may not in <lb/>

            injustice, and towards whom they do so. As regards <lb/>
            themselves then, it is when they think the thing is <lb/>
            one possible to be done, and possible to themselves; <lb/>
            and either that, in doing it, they shall escape detec­ <lb/>

            red will be less than the gain, either to themselves <lb/>
            or those for whom they have a regard. Now the <lb/>

            knowledge the designation in the indictment, or the <lb/>
            view of the case on which the indictment turns : a <lb/>
            man will avow, for example, his having taken a <lb/>
            thing, but not his having stolen it; that he struck <lb/>
            the first blow, but yet did not insult; that he co­ <lb/>
            habited, but did not commit adultery, with the woman <lb/>
            in question; or that he stole, but was not guilty of <lb/>
            sacrilege, for it was not consecrated property ; or that <lb/>
            he did till beyond his boundary, but encroached not <lb/>
            upon public land ; or conversed with the enemy, but <lb/>
            was yet not guilty of treason: it will, for these rea­ <lb/>
            sons, be necessary to lay down definitions on these <lb/>
            matters ; as to what essentially constitutes theft, in­ <lb/>
            sult, and adultery; in order that, if we wish to show <lb/>
            that they really do or do not exist, we may be able <note type="chapter"> 10. </note> <lb/>
            to set the right of the case in a true light. Now all <pb n="89"/>

            these questions, as to a matter being unjust and cri­ <lb/>
            minal, or not unjust, do in fact constitute the ground <lb/>
            of inquiry; for the criminality and injustice of the act <lb/>
            stands essentially in the deliberate principle on which <lb/>
            it is done ; and this sort of terms marks, over and <lb/>
            above the matter of fact, the principle also of the <lb/>
            agent; the terms, assault and felony, for instance ; for <lb/>
            because a man has struck another, he will not under <lb/>
            all circumstances have assaulted him, but if he has <lb/>
            done so with a view to something, as with a view to <lb/>
            treat him with disrespect, or to his own gratification : <lb/>
            neither, supposing a man has taken privily, has he <lb/>
            been guilty, in every case, of larceny; but if he took <lb/>
            it to the injury of another, or in order to appropriate <lb/>
            it to himself, then indeed he has been guilty of larceny. <lb/>
            The case too is similar respecting other terms de­ <lb/>

            happens against his will, when the question may have <lb/>
            escaped his notice ; but, with his will, whenever he <lb/>
            has it not in his power accurately to make distinc­ <lb/>
            tion, but it is necessary that he pronounce univer­ <lb/>
            sally, though the case be not so absolutely without <lb/>
            exceptions, but generally only. Thus also in respect <lb/>
            to all cases about which, by reason of their infinitude, <lb/>
            it is not easy to make distinctions; such, with regard <lb/>
            to wounding with steel, are the distinctions as to the <lb/>
            size and nature of the instrument, for an age would <note type="chapter"> 14. </note> <lb/>
            fail one in the enumeration. Be it then that the case <lb/>
            admits not such distinctions, yet if one must needs <lb/>
            enact a law respecting it, he cannot do otherwise than <lb/>
            speak in general terms 9; so that one who has so <lb/>
            much as a ring on his finger, and lifts up his hand and <lb/>
            strikes you, does by the letter of the written law <lb/>
            stand guilty, and acts unjustly; but in real truth he <lb/>
            does not act unjustly 10; and this is the equity of the <note type="footnote"> between man and man, that, to the utter undoing of some, <lb/>
            many things by strictness of law may be done, which EQUITY <lb/>
            and HONEST MEANING forbiddeth. Not that the LAW is unjust, <lb/>
            but imperfect; nor equity against, but above the law, binding <lb/>
            men's consciences in things which the law cannot reach unto. <lb/>
            Will any man say that the virtue of private equity is opposite <lb/>
            and repugnant to that law, the silence whereof it supplieth in all <lb/>
            such private dealing? No more is public equity against the <lb/>
            law of public affairs; albeit, the one permit unto some, in <lb/>
            special considerations, that which the other, agreeably with <lb/>
            general rules of justice, doth in general sort forbid. For, sith <lb/>

              not equitable. Since in whatever cases one is bound <lb/>

              Again, equity is the not esteeming faults and crimes <note type="chapter"> 16. </note> <lb/>
              of equal guilt, nor accidents, and faults. Now acci­ <lb/>
              dents are whatever things happen against all calcula­ <lb/>

              rather than to judicial decision, for the arbitrator <lb/>
              looks to what is equitable, the judge to what is law; <lb/>
              and in order to this it was that arbitration was in­ <lb/>

            versal law, and of topics of equity, as more absolutely <lb/>
            just: and he must argue that, really "to act to the <lb/>
            best of his judgment 2,” is to decline an implicit adher­ <lb/>
            ence to written prescript: he must insist, moreover, <note type="chapter"> 5. </note><note type="chapter"> 6. </note> <lb/>
            that equity remains for ever, and varies not at any <lb/>
            time, neither does the universal law, for this is in <lb/>
            conformity to nature ; but that the written law does <lb/>
            frequently vary; whence it was said in the Antigone <note type="footnote"> 1 He here apologizes for his violation of the proposed ar­ <lb/>

            thing substantially true and expedient, but not so <lb/>
            that mere seeming of justice, so that neither is the <lb/>
            written law, for it does not the duty of law. And <lb/>
            that the judge is, as it were, an assay-master, that <lb/>
            he may distinguish between counterfeit and real <lb/>
            ideas of justice. And that it is the part of a better <note type="chapter"> 8. </note> <lb/>
            man to employ and abide by the unwritten law than <lb/>
            the written. He should also observe, if the law <note type="chapter"> 9. </note> <lb/>
            which stands in his way be at variance with any ap­ <lb/>
            proved law, or be itself at variance with itself; thus <lb/>
            sometimes one law directs that whatever men shall <lb/>
            have covenanted should be valid; another forbids that <lb/>
            they should covenant any thing contrary to the law. <lb/>
            Observe, also, whether it be equivocal, so that you <note type="chapter"> 10. </note> <lb/>
            may wrest it to your purpose, and discover to which <lb/>
            construction either justice or expediency will best <lb/>
            adjust itself: then let him avail himself of that law. <lb/>
            And if the circumstances under which the law was <note type="chapter"> 11. </note> <lb/>
            enacted be no longer remaining4, but the law itself <lb/>
            is remaining, he should endeavour to make this clear, <lb/>
            and battle against it on this ground. But should the <note type="margin"> 12. Argu­ <lb/>

            him on <lb/>
            whose <lb/>

            must state that " the best of one's judgment" is in­ <lb/>
            serted, not for the sake of a judge's deciding contrary <lb/>
            to the law, but in order that, if he be ignorant of <lb/>
            what the law directs, he may not forswear himself. <lb/>
            He should insist also, that no one chooses good in the <lb/>
            abstract, but what is so to himself; and that there is <lb/>
            no difference between a law not enacted and one not <lb/>
            put in force. And he should observe that, in other <lb/>
            arts, it advantages not for one to indulge himself in <lb/>
            such over-wisdom; as, for example, in respect of a <note type="footnote"> 3 Already quoted in chap. 13, § 2. </note><note type="footnote">4 Vide the arguments adduced in favour of Catholic eman­ <lb/>

            And that the seeking to be wiser than the law, is the <lb/>

            some are partners in the risk, others are uninvolved <lb/>
            in it. I mean by ancient witnesses, both poets and <lb/>
            all other illustrious persons whose decisions are open <lb/>
            to the world; as, for example, the Athenians em­ <lb/>
            ployed Homer as their witness in the matter of <lb/>
            Salamis; and the people of Tenedos but recently <lb/>
            employed Periander the Corinthian, against the <lb/>
            people of Sigæum; Cleophon, also, employed the <lb/>
            Elegies of Solon against Critias, saying, that the <lb/>
            family of old time was a dissolute one, for Solon <lb/>
            would never otherwise have said, “Go, bid my <lb/>
            Critias, with his yellow locks, to listen to his father." <lb/>
            Such, then, are the witnesses on the subject of the <note type="margin"> 14. Wit­ <lb/>

            were to engage by sea, alleging the expression the <lb/>
            wooden wall6. Moreover, proverbs also are testi­ <lb/>
            monies, according to what has been stated above7; <lb/>
            as, if one were going to advise another not top make <lb/>
            an old man his friend, the proverb testifies to that <lb/>
            point, " Never benefit an old man ;” also as to the <lb/>
            taking off the children whose parents one has slain, <lb/>
            "Foolish is he who having slain the father shall <note type="footnote"> 5 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόσφατοι</foreign> seems to imply viva voce witnesses, those from <lb/>

            and are acquiesced in by all as the decisions of men of <lb/>

            tions ; as Eubulus, for instance, in the trial against <lb/>
            Chares, availed himself of that saying of Plato, in <lb/>
            reference to Archibius, that the avowal of being <lb/>
            wicked has gained ground in the city." Also those <lb/>
            who participate the risk, should they appear to falsify. <lb/>
            Witnesses, however, of this class, prove merely such <note type="margin"> 16. and <lb/>

            But in reference to testimony the following may be <lb/>
            adduced as confirmations of proof, by the orator, <lb/>
            namely, who has no witnesses: it should be insisted <lb/>
            that the judge ought to decide from probabilities, <lb/>
            and that this is the spirit of his oath, “to the best <lb/>
            of his judgment." Let him also say that it is im­ <lb/>

            taking more of justice. And that it is not possible to <lb/>
            alter what is just, either by fraud or force ; for it has <lb/>
            an existence in the nature of things13 : deeds, how- <note type="chapter"> 25. </note> <lb/>
            ever, are made both by persons who are imposed on, <lb/>
            and those who are compelled to make them. Observe, <lb/>
            moreover, whether it be in opposition to any written <lb/>
            law, or any universal principle of right, and to the <lb/>
            principles of justice and honour; whether again it <lb/>
            be opposed to other later or earlier deeds; for either <lb/>
            the later are valid, and the earlier invalid ; or the <lb/>
            earlier are correct, and the later have been obtained <lb/>
            by stratagem; urging whichever of these cases may <lb/>
            happen to suit the purpose. Have an eye moreover <lb/>
            to the matter of expediency, whether the deed stand <lb/>

            he refuses <lb/>

            ground of its being an oath for a pecuniary object; <lb/>
            and because, if he were a worthless fellow, he would <lb/>

            better surely to be a villain for some object, rather <lb/>
            than for none; for if he but take the oath, he will <lb/>
            gain his cause, if he decline taking it, he will not. <lb/>
            Thus, then, his not taking it will be from virtuous <lb/>
            motives, not from fear of forswearing himself; here, <lb/>
            too, the saying of Xenophanes is in point, viz. that <lb/>
            this sort of appeal, made by an impious man to a <lb/>
            pious, is not fair, but is just such an one, as if a ro­ <lb/>

            that he feels confidence in himself, but none in his <lb/>
            adversary. Let him also declare, inverting the saying <lb/>
            of Xenophanes, that it is fair enough if the impious <lb/>
            man tenders the oath, and the pious man takes it; <lb/>
            also, that it is surely a strange thing that a man <lb/>
            should be unwilling himself to take an oath, in a <lb/>
            question about which he calls on the judges to give <lb/>
            their verdict on oath.</p>

            that a willingness to intrust the question to the gods <lb/>
            is a matter of piety; and that his adversary need <lb/>

            sentence of a court of justice is ipso facto a decision) ; <lb/>
            it is necessary to look not only to your speech, in <lb/>
            what way that will be of a character to convince and <lb/>
            persuade, but also to invest yourself with a certain <lb/>
            kind of character, and the judge with a certain kind <lb/>
            of feeling. For it is a point of great consequence, <note type="chapter"> 3. </note> <lb/>
            particularly in deliberative! cases ; and, next to these, <lb/>
            in judicial; as well that the speaker seem to be a man <lb/>

            Now, as to a speaker's appearing to be himself of a <lb/>
            certain character, this point is more available in de­ <lb/>
            liberations : but the disposing the auditor in a certain <lb/>
            way, in judicial cases ; for things do not show them­ <lb/>
            selves in the same light to persons affected by love <lb/>
            and by hatred, nor to those under emotions of anger, <lb/>
            as to those who are disposed to placability; but they <lb/>
            appear either utterly different in character, or at least <lb/>
            different in degree. For to a judge who is affected <lb/>
            by love toward the party respecting whom he pro­ <lb/>
            nounces his decision, that party appears either not at <lb/>
            all to be unjust, or to be so in a very trivial degree. <lb/>
            To a judge, however, who is affected by hatred, the <lb/>
            case has a contrary appearance. So also to a person <lb/>
            who is eager and sanguine, the proposed object, if <lb/>
            pleasant, takes the appearance, as well of being likely <lb/>
            to accrue, as of being likely to prove really a good ; <lb/>
            while by one who is indifferent and reluctant, the <lb/>

            ample, how those who are susceptible of anger are <lb/>
            affected; with whom they usually are angry; and <lb/>
            on what occasions. For, granted that we be in pos­ <lb/>
            session of one, or even two of these points, and not <lb/>
            of them all, it will be impossible for us to kindle <lb/>
            anger in the breast; and in the case of the rest of the <lb/>
            passions in a similar way. In the same way, then, <lb/>
            as on the subjects treated of above I have separately <lb/>
            drawn up the several propositions, so let me do in re­ <lb/>
            spect of these also, and make my distinctions ac­ <lb/>

            tends doing so. It must be also that there is a sort <lb/>
            of pleasure consequent on all anger, arising out of <lb/>
            the hope of avenging one's self3; for the idea of at­ <lb/>
            taining what one desires is pleasant; and no one is <lb/>
            desirous of objects which appear impracticable to him; <lb/>
            and he who is under the affection of anger is desirous <lb/>
            of objects which appear practicable to him. Where­ <lb/>
            fore it has been happily remarked of anger, that it is, <lb/>
            " Far, far too dear to every mortal breast, <lb/>
            Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste4.” <lb/>
            Because a sort of pleasure is consequent on it, as well <lb/>
            on this account, as because men linger in thought on <lb/>
            compassing revenge. Now the phantasy which then <lb/>

            bad, and those which are good, and what conduces to <lb/>

            contempt, vexatiousness, and contumely: for he who <lb/>
            manifests contempt is guilty of a slight, since men <lb/>
            contemn whatever they think worth nothing, and <lb/>
            what is worth nothing, they slight. Again, he who <lb/>
            is vexatious appears to contemn, for vexatiousness is <lb/>
            a thwarting another's wishes, not that any thing may <lb/>

            order that something may not accrue to that other. <lb/>
            Since, then, he slights not with a view to any ad­ <lb/>
            vantage to himself, it is plain that he conceives you <lb/>
            can neither hurt him, (for, if he did, he would be <lb/>
            afraid, and would not be guilty of slight,) nor can <lb/>
            benefit him in any respect worth mentioning, since <lb/>
            he would otherwise hold you in consideration, in order <lb/>
            to become your friend.6 He, too, who acts contume- <note type="chapter"> 6. </note> <lb/>
            liously manifests slight; for contumely is the doing <lb/>
            and saying those things about which the person who <lb/>
            is the subject of this treatment, has feelings of deli­ <lb/>
            cacy, not with a view that any thing should accrue <lb/>
            to himself, other than what arises to him in the act, <lb/>
            but in order that he may be gratified; for they who <lb/>
            requite an injury, do not act contumeliously, but take <lb/>
            revenge. Now the cause of the pleasure felt by those <note type="chapter"> 6. </note> <lb/>
            who act contumeliously, is that, by injuring, they <lb/>
            conceive themselves to be more decidedly superior: <lb/>
            on which account young men and the rich are given <lb/>
            to contumely, for in manifesting the contumely, they <lb/>
            conceive themselves superior. To contumely belongs <lb/>
            the withholding of respect; but he who withholds <lb/>
            respect, manifests slight; for that which is of no <lb/>
            value, is held in no consideration, either good or bad. <lb/>
            On which principle Achilles, in his anger, says, " He <lb/>
            hath withheld from me respect, for he hath seized <lb/>
            and possesses my prize himself, having taken it from <lb/>
            me." And again, " Like some unregarded vaga­ <lb/>
            bond ;" as though he were, on this account, affected <lb/>
            by anger. Now people think it becoming that they <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            should De looKea up to oy their interiors, whether <lb/>
            in birth, power, or moral excellence, or generally <lb/>
            speaking, in whatever respect one may happen to be <note type="footnote"> 5 It is an essential feature of vexatiousness, and in fact of <lb/>
            every species of slight, that there is a total absence of any self­ <lb/>
            ish motive on the part of him who offers it; the appearance of <lb/>
            any such motive having actuated him, would be a salvo to the <lb/>
            pride of him who is made the subject of such treatment; but <lb/>
            to be exposed to an opinion that one is utterly beneath con­ <lb/>
            sideration (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δόξα περὶ τὸ μηδενὸς ἄξιον φαινόμενον</foreign>), is a reflec­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            much superior: thus the rich man thinks to be looked <lb/>
            up to by the poor, in regard to money; also the man <lb/>
            who has a faculty of speaking, by him who is desti­ <lb/>
            tute of it, in the case of speaking ; and he who thinks <lb/>
            himself worthy to bear office, by him who deserves <lb/>
            to be subject to rule. Whence it has been said, <lb/>
            " Beware ! for dreadful is the wrath of kings:” <lb/>
            and in another place, <lb/>
            " 'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last:” <lb/>
            for they feel indignant by reason of their superiority. <note type="chapter"> 8. </note> <lb/>
            Moreover [men think it becoming that they should <lb/>
            be looked up to] by those at whose hands they think <lb/>
            they ought to receive good; and these are such as <lb/>
            they have benefited, or continue to benefit, whether <lb/>
            in their own persons, or as instruments of any one, <lb/>
            and whom any of their relatives have benefited, or <lb/>

            der what affections as regards themselves, and with <lb/>
            what objects, and for what reasons, men feel anger. <lb/>
            For as regards themselves, it is when they happen to <lb/>
            be aggrieved, since he who is aggrieved is anxious <lb/>
            for something. Now a man [will feel thus aggrieved], <lb/>
            as well on any person's clashing with him in regard <lb/>
            to any object, directly; when he is thirsty, for exam­ <lb/>
            ple, in regard to drinking: as also should they not <lb/>
            directly clash, yet will he appear to do the same thing; <lb/>
            and if a person thwarts, or does not co-operate with <lb/>
            one, and if a person annoys one in any respect, when <lb/>
            thus circumstanced, one feels anger against all these. <note type="chapter"> 10. </note> <lb/>
            On which account people who are ill, in poverty, love, <lb/>
            thirst, in a word, who are under desire, and fail of <lb/>
            success, these all are fretful and irritable, and parti­ <lb/>
            cularly with those who slight their present condition: <lb/>
            the sick man, for example, is annoyed by those who <lb/>
            slight him in regard to his disease: the poor man too, <lb/>
            with those who do so in regard to his poverty; and <lb/>
            the warrior, in regard to war; the lover, in regard to <lb/>
            love; and in other cases similarly, for each one has <lb/>
            the way paved to the feeling anger in each case, by <pb n="109"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. II.] </note> <lb/>
            the passion which exists in his mind. Again, a man <note type="chapter"> 11. </note> <lb/>
            is nettled should he happen to be expecting the very <lb/>
            opposite of what results; for that pains one more <lb/>
            deeply which falls out very unexpectedly; just in the <lb/>
            same ratio as that which is very unexpected de­ <lb/>
            lights, should it be what one wishes for. On which <lb/>
            account seasons, times, dispositions, and ages, which <lb/>
            class of them are readily excited to anger, and when, <lb/>
            and how, will be plain from this which I have said ; <lb/>
            also it will be plain that they are then excited with <lb/>
            greater readiness, when more immediately influenced <lb/>
            by these circumstances. As then regards the persons <lb/>
            themselves, under these dispositions it is that they <lb/>
            are readily excited to anger.</p>
          <p>2. But people feel anger towards those who laugh <note type="margin"> 12. To­ <lb/>

            at them excessively, and gibe, and scoff at them, for <lb/>
            these treat them with contumely ; with such also as <lb/>

            tokens of contumely: these of course must be such as <lb/>
            neither are in requital for any thing, or beneficial to <lb/>
            those who are the agents 6; for this is enough to make <lb/>
            it appear to be an act solely of contumely: towards <note type="chapter"> 13. </note> <lb/>
            those also who underrate and despise what themselves <lb/>
            take a warm interest in; thus all those who are fond <lb/>
            of philosophy, are angry if any one undervalues phi­ <lb/>
            losophy ; so, too, they who embrace the notion of an <lb/>
            universal idea7, are nettled if a person despises the <lb/>
            doctrine; and as regards other things in a similar <lb/>

            feel it also in a greater degree towards persons of no <lb/>

            also if they should not perceive us to be in want, <lb/>
            just as the Plexippus9 of Antipho was angry with <lb/>
            Meleager; for not to perceive this is a token of <lb/>
            slight, since in regard to those for whom we feel <note type="chapter"> 20. </note> <lb/>
            deference, this does not escape our notice: towards <lb/>
            those also it is felt who exult in their misfortunes; <lb/>
            and, in a word, towards such as are in good spirits <lb/>
            amid their misfortunes ; for this marks either a foe, <lb/>
            or one who manifests slight: towards those also who <lb/>

            the presence of those whom they emulate, whom they <lb/>
            admire, by whom they are desirous of being ad­ <lb/>
            mired, in whose presence they are alive to delicacy <lb/>
            of feeling, and before those who have a delicacy of <lb/>
            feeling towards them; if before these any one should <lb/>
            slight them, they feel anger more sensibly: with <lb/>
            those also do men feel angry who slight them in such <lb/>
            respects, as it is disgraceful for them not to stand up <lb/>
            in defence of; in regard to parents, for instance, or <lb/>
            children, wives, or persons in subjection: with those, <lb/>
            too, who make no return of favours; for the slight <lb/>
            then is contrary to what is becoming : and with those <lb/>
            who play off sarcasms upon them when seriously en­ <lb/>
            gaged ; for sarcasm has an air of contempt: also with <lb/>
            those who benefit others, if they do not also benefit <lb/>
            them; since this also carries an air of contempt, the <lb/>
            not thinking them worthy what all are worthy of. <lb/>
            Also the letting a man escape our memory is a thing <lb/>
            very apt to provoke anger; for example, the nearly <lb/>
            forgetting even his name, since forgetfulness seems <lb/>
            to be an indication of slight; because forgetfulness <lb/>
            arises from disregard, and disregard is a kind of <lb/>
            slight. Now, it has been told you against whom men <lb/>
            feel anger, and under what dispositions, and why11. <lb/>
            It evidently will be needful for an orator to work up <lb/>
            his audience by his speech, into such a frame of mind <lb/>
            as that under which men are prone to anger, and his <lb/>
            adversary, too, as being obnoxious to that on account <lb/>
            of which men feel anger, and as being such an one as <lb/>
            people feel anger against. <note type="footnote"> 11 Vide this chapter, § 3. </note></p><pb n="112"/>

            Now, if men feel anger towards those who slight <lb/>
            them, and if slight be voluntary, it is plain that they <lb/>
            are placable in regard to those who do no such thing, <lb/>
            or who either do so, or appear to do so, involuntarily : <lb/>
            towards those also who wish the contrary of what <lb/>

            of pain for what they have done as a punishment, <lb/>
            they are appeased :-there is proof of this in the <lb/>
            case of chastising servants; for we chastise more vio­ <lb/>

            but towards such as acknowledge themselves to be <lb/>
            justly punished, we cease from our wrath2; the rea­ <lb/>
            son of which is, that the denial of what is evident <lb/>
            is a sort of impudence, and impudence is slight and <lb/>

            should consider the subject of placability, from the <lb/>
            opposite of the doctrine of anger. Once more, it is <note type="margin"> Whom we <lb/>

            felt towards those whom men fear, or have a delicacy <lb/>

            are not influenced by anger; since it is impossible <lb/>
            to feel anger and fear at the same time. Again, <note type="margin"> 11. To­ <lb/>

            ed under the influences of anger ; for these appear <lb/>
            to have acted, not from any motive of slight; for no <lb/>
            one who is angry with you slights you ; since slight <note type="chapter"> 12. </note> <lb/>

            one object allays the anger felt against another, even <lb/>
            if he be more violent. For which reason, Philocrates, <lb/>
            when some one asked him " how it was, as the popu­ <lb/>
            lace were enraged with him, that he did not make his <lb/>
            defence," very justly said, " I will not do it yet.”— <lb/>
            " But when will you ?"—" I will do it, when I see <lb/>
            some one else criminated." For people, after they <lb/>
            have exhausted their anger on some other object, <lb/>
            become placable ; which happened in the case of Er­ <lb/>
            gophilus; for the populace, though more indignant <lb/>
            with him than with Callisthenes, yet acquitted him, <lb/>
            because, on the day before, they had condemned Cal- <note type="chapter"> 14. </note> <lb/>
            listhenes to death. Men are thus disposed if they <lb/>
            have convicted the object, and if he have suffered a <lb/>
            greater ill than they, with all their anger, would have <lb/>
            themselves inflicted; for they think they have got­ <lb/>
            ten, as it were, their revenge. Again, if they are <lb/>

            for in that case men no longer conceive themselves <lb/>
            sufferers contrary to what is becoming; but anger <lb/>
            was defined to be such a feeling. On which account <lb/>
            we should preface punishment with a sort of lecture; <lb/>
            for thus even slaves feel less indignant at being pun- <note type="margin"> 16. When <lb/>

            punished by them, and in return for what they have <lb/>
            have suffered; for anger is felt against individuals: <note type="footnote"> second hearing of the Mitylenæans;—<foreign xml:lang="grc">θαυμάζω μὲν τω̃ν χρόνον</foreign> </note><figure type="illustration">

            reference to ourselves; hatred, however, even inde­ <lb/>
            pendently of any thing having reference to ourselves, <lb/>
            since if we conceive a person to be of a certain de­ <lb/>
            scription, we bear hatred towards him. 2. And our <lb/>
            anger invariably has reference to individual objects, <lb/>
            as to Callias or Socrates ; but hatred may be borne <lb/>
            even to whole classes; for every one hates the cha­ <lb/>
            racter of a thief and an informer. 3. Again, the one <lb/>
            feeling is to be remedied by time; the other is in­ <lb/>
            curable. 4. Also the first is a desire of inflicting pain <lb/>
            on its object, the last of doing him deadly harm; for <lb/>
            the angry man wishes to be felt9, to him who bears <lb/>
            hatred this matters not; and all things which give <lb/>
            pain may be felt; but what does harm in the highest <lb/>
            degree, is least capable of being felt, for instance, in­ <lb/>
            justice and folly, for the presence of vice does not at <lb/>
            all pain [him to whom it is present]. 5. And anger is <lb/>
            attended by pain, hatred is not; for he who is affect­ <lb/>

            suffering some destructive evil, it is plain that none <lb/>
            of those who consider that they shall not suffer any <lb/>
            thing, is subject to fear; and that no one is subject <lb/>
            to it, in regard to those things which he does not con­ <lb/>

            and who think themselves to be, in the midst of great <lb/>
            good fortune, at all apprehensive of suffering any <lb/>
            thing, (on which account they are contumelious, con­ <lb/>

            them, just as those who have been already beaten on <lb/>

            there must needs arise some hope of safety, about <note type="footnote"> 7 Fuisset; <lb/>

            which men feel the painful anxiety8; and this is a <lb/>
            proof of it, that fear makes men deliberate; and yet <lb/>
            no one deliberates about that which is utterly hope­ <lb/>
            less. So that, when it shall better serve our cause <note type="chapter"> 15. </note> <lb/>
            that the audience be affected by fear, we must set <lb/>
            them off as persons liable to suffer, inasmuch as others <lb/>
            of greater power have suffered, and also to show that <lb/>
            their equals are or have been exposed to sufferings; <lb/>
            and this, at the hands of persons from whom they <lb/>
            would not have apprehended it, and such things, and <lb/>
            at times when they would not have apprehended it.</p>
          <p>But since on the subject of fear, it is plain what it <note type="margin"> 16. Confi­ <lb/>

            also with what dispositions men experience it; from <lb/>
            this it will be plain both what confidence is, and on <lb/>
            what points men are confident, and with what dis­ <lb/>
            positions ; for both confidence itself is the opposite of <lb/>
            fear, and what inspires it is the opposite of what ex­ <lb/>
            cites fear; so that it is the hope of things conducive <lb/>
            to safety, accompanied by an idea that they are near; <lb/>
            and of things to be feared, that they either do not <lb/>

            the non-participation in it begins to be disgraceful; <lb/>
            for instance, the not having been educated2, at least <lb/>

            what they know to the world; for whether a man <lb/>
            does not think one's conduct faulty, or does not divulge <lb/>
            it, makes no difference. But persons likely to di­ <lb/>

            the poets of the old comedy ; for these are in some <lb/>

            are sensible of shame] before those with whom they <lb/>
            never met with a repulse; for they are disposed to­ <lb/>
            wards them as admirers. On which account men <lb/>
            have a sense of shame, even towards those who ask <lb/>
            any thing for the first time, as having never yet for­ <lb/>

            indications of it; not only in doing what is disgrace­ <lb/>

            quality of greatness, and of which chance is the <note type="chapter"> 9. </note> <lb/>
            cause . But the evils whose characteristic is great <lb/>
            anguish and destruction, are as follows: death, as­ <lb/>
            saults, personal injuries, and age, and sickness, and <note type="chapter"> 10. </note> <lb/>
            want of tood. And the evils of which chance is the <lb/>
            cause, are, absolute want, or fewness of friends, (on <lb/>
            which account even the being torn from friends and <lb/>

            some good, when one has already passed his suffer­ <lb/>

            either that no good has accrued, or of there being no <lb/>

            greater clearness as possible to befall also one's self. <lb/>
            For we must here also assume generally, that what­ <lb/>
            ever people fear in their own case, that they pity as <lb/>
            happening in the case of others. But as the disasters <note type="chapter"> 14. </note> <lb/>
            which excite pity always appear to be close at hand, <lb/>
            while, as to those removed at the distance of ten <lb/>

            them, if future, nor in the remembrance of them, if <lb/>
            past, are sensible of pity at all, or at least not in an <lb/>

              [only], but of equals and fellows2. The feeling, <lb/>

            further good: here, too, those of recent wealth, who <lb/>
            by means of their wealth get into office, give greater <lb/>
            pain than those who have been wealthy of old. And <lb/>
            in a similar manner in the case of the others. But <note type="margin"> 10. They <lb/>

            the reason of this is, that while the one sort appear <lb/>

            that which appears ever to have held this rank, <lb/>

            to a man whose virtue is justice, but to him who <lb/>
            possesses courage; and splendid marriage feasts are <lb/>
            not adapted to those of recent wealth, but to those of <lb/>
            high birth: therefore if any one, though he may be <lb/>
            a good man, meet with a possession which is not <lb/>
            adapted to him, we should feel indignant; as also <lb/>
            with an inferior who disputes with his superior; and <lb/>
            particularly if he does so on the very points in which <lb/>
            he is inferior. Whence also this was remarked by <lb/>

            for instance, if a musician were to dispute with a <lb/>
            just man, for justice is superior to music. The per­ <lb/>

            most striking almost of its dispositions are evident; <lb/>
            for of these power has some in common with wealth, <lb/>
            and others which are better. For men in power are <lb/>
            more ambitious and more manly in their dispositions <lb/>
            than the wealthy; from their aiming at all duties <lb/>
            whatsoever, which from their power they have the <lb/>
            means of discharging. And they are less given to <lb/>
            trifling, because, from a necessity of looking carefully <lb/>
            to their power, they are constrained to a diligent at­ <lb/>
            tention. And they comport themselves with a dig­ <lb/>
            nity which is conciliatory rather than repulsive; for <lb/>
            their claims for dignity render them more conspicuous ; <lb/>
            on which account, they bear themselves moderately : <lb/>
            but conciliatory dignity is a softened and graceful <lb/>

            are of importance, that they are guilty.</p>

            of the disposition of the states which have been de­ <lb/>

            inconsiderate in consequence of prosperity. But one <lb/>
            disposition, and that most excellent, is a concomitant <lb/>
            of good fortune, viz. that the fortunate are lovers of <lb/>

            because the person [be he who he may], whomsoever <lb/>

            sweep away objections against which, as against an <lb/>
            adversary, he directs his address); this is just as much <lb/>
            the case in demonstrative oratory (since the speech <lb/>
            commends itself to the listener just as though to a <lb/>
            judge). But he alone is strictly a judge, who decides <lb/>

            both forensic questions, and those on which men de­ <lb/>

            dispositions, as they are affected by the constitutions <lb/>

            necessary to attempt to show that certain things will <lb/>
            take place, and for others that they have taken place. <lb/>
            And again, the topic of greatness is common to all <lb/>

            you suffer in the same way as the horse ; for already, <lb/>

          <p>And Æsop, when pleading at Samoa in behalf of <note type="margin"> 6. </note> <lb/>
            a demagogue who was tried for his life, said, " That <lb/>

            will be produced by them: but one who possesses <lb/>
            [enthymems] should employ them like evidence, put­ <lb/>
            ting them forward after his enthymems, in way of a <lb/>
            conclusion. Because, if they be put first, they bear <lb/>
            resemblance to induction; and induction, except in <lb/>
            few instances, is not proper to rhetoric; whereas <lb/>
            when put in at the end, they resemble evidence; and <lb/>
            a witness in every case influences belief. On which <lb/>
            account, there is moreover a necessity imposed on <lb/>
            him who puts them first of citing many; for him, <lb/>
            however, who states them in conclusion even one is <lb/>
            sufficient; for a credible witness, though but single, <lb/>

            what persons it befits to avail themselves of the <lb/>

            many subjects as moral conduct is concerned about, <lb/>
            and as are objects of choice or avoidance in acting. <lb/>
            So that, as the enthymem is a form of reasoning <note type="margin">Conclu­ <lb/>

            nearly [confined] to this description of subjects, both <lb/>

            after the syllogistic form has been done away, be­ <lb/>

            sitions, he cautions you against supposing that every general <lb/>
            proposition deserves this appellation. For example, mathe­ <lb/>
            matical truths are asserted in propositions, general enough it <lb/>
            is true, which however do not come up to the notion which <lb/>
            Aristotle would have you form of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμη</foreign>. I hardly know <lb/>
            whether it be allowable to attempt an explanation of Aristotle <lb/>
            from a popular comedy ; but those readers who remember the <lb/>
            School for Scandal, may probably derive some illustration of <lb/>
            this subject from the ' sentiments' there put in the mouth of <lb/>
            Joseph Surface ; e. g. " The heart that is conscious of its own <lb/>
            integrity, is ever slow to credit another's treachery." Act iv. <lb/>
            scene 3. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In other words, the maxim is to the enthymem what pro­ <lb/>
            positions are to syllogisms. Not to every enthymem does the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμη</foreign> hold this relation, but to such only as are conversant <lb/>
            with " the actions and passions of common life." Aristotle <lb/>
            has not ventured to tell us that all enthymems relate to these <lb/>
            subjects; he says only that " nearly" all of them are so con­ <lb/>
            versant ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τοιούτων ἐστὶ σχεδόν</foreign>. </note> <pb n="170"/>

            in his sound mind never ought to educate his chil­ <lb/>
            dren so as to be too highly skilled 3." Now this is a <lb/>
            maxim: but if the reason, and the cause why he <lb/>
            should not do so, be added, the whole [conjointly] will <lb/>
            become an enthymem; thus, " for besides <lb/>
            the indolence which they contract, they will attach <lb/>
            to themselves the bitter jealousy of the citizens." <lb/>
            Again, this : " There is not a man who in every <lb/>
            respect is happy4:" and the following: "There is <lb/>
            not one of all mankind who is free5," are maxims: <lb/>
            and the last becomes an enthymem, if added to the <lb/>
            following proposition, " for either he is the <lb/>
            slave of money or of fortune."</p>
          <p><note type="margin">3. Maxims <lb/>
            are of four <lb/>
            kinds. </note> If, then, the maxim be what it has been described, <lb/>
            there will necessarily be four kinds of maxims: for <lb/>
            either they will be with the annexed reason, or with- <note type="margin"> 4. i. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετ' <lb/>

            out it. Now the maxims which need proof are all <lb/>
            such as assert any thing which contravenes received <lb/>

            contrary to peopled notions do well enough] with- <note type="chapter"> 5. </note> <lb/>
            out the addition of proot. And of these last it can­ <lb/>
            not but be that some will need no proofs, from their <lb/>
            having been previously known ; as, " The best thing <lb/>
            for a man, as it seems to me at least, is health -be­ <lb/>
            cause to nine-tenths of mankind this seems to be the <lb/>
            case: and that others simultaneously with their being <lb/>
            uttered become evident to such as turn their attention <lb/>
            to them ; as, " There is no lover who does not always <note type="margin"> 6. Those <lb/>

            joined, some are a part of an enthymem, just as, " A <lb/>
            man who is in his sound mind never ought," etc. <lb/>
            Others are essentially enthymems, and not part of <lb/>
            an enthymem ; the which obtain more than any <lb/>
            other species. And these are all those in which the <lb/>
            reason for what is asserted appears wrought in, as <note type="footnote"> 3 Euripides, Medea, 294. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 From a lost drama of Euripides, entitled Sthenobœa. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Euripides, Hecuba, 864. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 I have ventured thus to render <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίλογος</foreign>; for that such is <lb/>

            " one ought not always to cherish wrath," is a maxim; <lb/>
            that, however, which is added, viz. "because you <lb/>
            are a mortal," states the reason why. Similar to <lb/>
            which is the following: “ It is fitting that a mortal <lb/>
            conceive mortal notions, not that a being destined to <lb/>
            death should think of what is immortal 7."</p>

            as also to what kind of subjects they are severally <lb/>
            adapted. For on subjects which may be questioned, <lb/>
            or contravene received opinions, the orator must not <lb/>
            use those without the reason annexed; but let him <lb/>
            either, prefixing the reason, use the conclusion as a <lb/>
            maxim, thus—“ For my part, as then it neither is <lb/>
            good to be exposed to envy, nor to be indolent, I <lb/>
            assert that it is not good to be educated ;" or, stating <lb/>
            this [which here is the conclusion] first, subjoin that <lb/>
            which was prefixed 8. Observing that on subjects <lb/>
            which do not contravene received opinions, but are <lb/>
            doubtful, that he annex the reason why as concisely <lb/>

            about which one is ignorant is silly, and argues a <lb/>

            other people most fond of hammering out maxims, <note type="chapter"> 10. </note> <lb/>
            and set them forth with great volubility. Also the <lb/>
            stating generally a maxim which is, in fact, not ge­ <lb/>

            which are current and common, if they be of any <lb/>

            be correct, as though every one acknowledged their <lb/>
            truth11: this one, for instance, (if the orator be ex­ <lb/>

            not sacrificed,) " One omen there is which is best, to <lb/>

            to give a mamfestation of our moral principle by <lb/>
            means of the diction we employ, otherwise to subjoin <lb/>
            the reason; for instance, either stating the sentence <lb/>
            thus, " we ought to love, not as they tell us, but as <lb/>
            though always about to love, for the other is the part <lb/>

            For in advising Achilles, or in praising or blaming <lb/>

            the traits which attach, or appear to attach, to his <lb/>

            we may, in so praising or blaming him, allege what­ <lb/>
            ever things honourable or base attach to him; and in <lb/>
            accusing or defending him, whatever things just or <lb/>

            pediency. So that as all men appear thus to con­ <lb/>
            struct their proofs, whether they draw their inferences <lb/>
            with greater accuracy or remissness, (for they do not <lb/>

            evident] that the orator should conduct his inquiry <lb/>
            respecting questions which arise on the sudden in the <lb/>
            same manner, not turning his view aside to indefinite <lb/>
            points, but to the actual points of the case which the <lb/>
            oration is concerning; and embracing in his sketch <lb/>
            the greatest number he is able, and those coming the <lb/>
            nearest to the point; for in proportion as he is master <lb/>
            of the greater number of the things inherent in the <lb/>
            case, by so much the easier will it be to effect proof; <lb/>
            and in proportion as these are the nearer to the point, <lb/>
            in the very same proportion will they be more peculiar, <lb/>
            and less vague. By vague I mean, the praising <note type="chapter"> 12. </note> <lb/>
            Achilles because he is a man, and one of the deified <lb/>
            heroes, and made war against Troy ; for these are <lb/>
            points attaching to a thousand others beside: so that <lb/>
            such an orator no more praises Achilles than he does <lb/>
            Diomed. But by peculiar I mean, those which be­ <lb/>
            fall no one else than to Achilles, for instance, the <lb/>
            slaying Hector, the bravest of the Trojans ; and <lb/>
            Cycnus, who, being himself invulnerable, prevented <lb/>
            all the forces from landing ; and that he joined the <lb/>
            expedition the youngest, and without being bound by <lb/>
            an oath; and whatever other topics are of this de­ <lb/>
            scription. One element of enthymems, then, is that <note type="margin"> The topic <lb/>
            of selec­ <lb/>
            tion. </note> <lb/>
            of selection ; and this is the first which partakes of <lb/>
            the nature of topics.</p>
          <p>And now let us state the elements of enthymems; <note type="chapter"> 13. </note> <lb/>
            (but by pace and element of an enthymem I mean <lb/>
            the same thing). First, however, let us treat of those <note type="margin"> 14. Two <lb/>
            sorts of <lb/>
            enthy­ <lb/>
            mems: <lb/>

            ἐλεκτικὰ</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
            points concerning which it is necessary first to speak. <lb/>
            For of enthymems there are two species; the one <lb/>
            species are confirmative, that such is or is not the <lb/>
            fact; and the other refutative: and they differ just <lb/>
            as, in logic, the syllogism and the elenchus differ. <lb/>
            And the confirmative enthymem is the deducing a <note type="chapter"> 15. </note> <lb/>
            conclusion from acknowledged premises; the refuta- <note type="footnote"> 8 Cum pervestigare argumentum aliquod volumus, locos nosse <lb/>

            not admitted. Now the general arguments nearly on <lb/>
            each class of subjects necessary and useful to be <lb/>
            known are in our possession; for propositions have <lb/>
            been selected on each [branch of rhetoric] ; so that <lb/>
            the topics out of which one must allege his enthy­ <lb/>
            mems, whether on questions of good or evil, just or <lb/>
            unjust, honourable or dishonourable, select points <lb/>
            moreover respecting the dispositions, the passions, <lb/>

            putting a mark on them severally as we proceed, <lb/>
            state both the refutative and confirmative elements, <lb/>
            as well as those of apparent enthymems, which, how­ <lb/>
            ever, are not really enthymems, for neither in truth <lb/>
            are they [the elements of actual] syllogisms. When <lb/>
            these points have been elucidated, we shall discuss the <lb/>
            subject of starting objections to enthymems, and the <lb/>
            means of their solution, from what sources we ought <lb/>

            founding one thereon ourselves: for example, the ar­ <lb/>

            bles, of course we shall put ourselves right again <lb/>
            with the return of peace." And, " If in truth it be <lb/>
            not just to be angry with those who unwillingly do <lb/>
            us harm; neither, if one on compulsion shall do <lb/>

            And, " If to speak falsely is among men available <lb/>
            to persuade; there is no anomaly in supposing, on <lb/>

            for the qualities must either be inherent consistently, <lb/>

            the idea of his having acted honourably or justly, to <lb/>
            the other also will attach that of having suffered <lb/>

            said of the revenues, " If it be not base for you to <lb/>
            put them up for sale, neither is it for us to purchase <lb/>
            them." And if the idea that he has suffered justly <lb/>

            it also be on that of the agent; and if on that of the <lb/>

            suade respecting two propositions, and those opposed <lb/>
            to each other; and to avail ourselves of the foremen­ <lb/>
            tioned argument in the case of both. The difference <lb/>
            [between this and the element last mentioned] is, that <lb/>
            in it the opposition is merely between any proposi­ <lb/>
            tions which may happen, it here holds between con­ <lb/>
            traries : for instance, a priestess was endeavouring to <lb/>
            prevent her son from becoming a public speaker ; <note type="footnote"> 13 See book i. chap. vi. § 26; where, in stating that to be <lb/>
            good which is an object of preference, he cites these two in­ <lb/>
            stances. </note><note type="footnote"> 14 It is, however, a mode of argument sometimes so falla. <lb/>
            cious, that we may say with Ovid, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [ BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            because, said she, " If on the one hand you speak <lb/>
            what is just, men will hate you ; if what is unjust, <lb/>
            the gods." [Here then it might be retorted], there­ <lb/>
            fore you ought to become a public speaker; for, " if <lb/>
            you speak what is just, the gods will love you; if <lb/>
            what is unjust, men 15." And this is equivalent to <lb/>
            the proverb " of buying dirt as well as salt." And <lb/>
            the retortion is this, when on each of two contraries <lb/>
            good and evil is consequent, they being respectively <lb/>
            opposed.</p>

            not approve the same things privately as before the <lb/>
            world; but when in public, they praise beyond all <lb/>
            things what is just and honourable ; but within <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">17. <lb/>
            xvi. From <lb/>
            analogy. </note> Another element is deducible from the analogy of <lb/>
            results; as Iphicrates urged when they compelled <lb/>
            his son to serve who was under the standard age, be­ <lb/>
            cause he was tall, that " if they esteem great children <lb/>
            as men, they assuredly will vote small men to be <lb/>
            children." And Theodectes, in the oration respect­ <lb/>
            ing the law, asked, "Do ye make the mercenaries, <lb/>
            such as Strabax and Charidemus, citizens on account <lb/>
            of their virtue, and will ye not make exiles of those <lb/>
            among the mercenaries who have committed these <lb/>
            intolerable acts?"</p>

            conse­ <lb/>

            sult be the same, the principle from which it arises <lb/>
            will be the same; just as Xenophanes used to argue, <lb/>
            that " they are equally guilty of impiety who assert <lb/>
            that the gods were produced, as those who assert that <lb/>
            they die; for in both cases it happens that in some <lb/>
            period or other the gods do not exist." And generally <note type="footnote"> 15 See an instance of this mode of arguing used by Tiresias, <lb/>
            Euripides, Phœnissæ, 968. Of this kind is also the argument <lb/>
            of Gamaliel: " If this counsel or this work be of men, it will <lb/>
            come to nought; but, if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it." <lb/>
            Acts v. 38, 39. </note> <pb n="187"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XXIII.] </note> <lb/>
            assuming that the result of each act is in every case <lb/>
            identified with it. [Take this argument as an illus­ <lb/>
            tration] : "Ye are about to pronounce, not respect­ <lb/>
            ing Socrates, but respecting the pursuit in general, <lb/>
            whether it be right to addict one's self to philosophy." <lb/>
            And this, "that the giving earth and water is the <lb/>
            being slaves." And "that the participating in the <lb/>
            common peace is the performing of what is enjoined." <lb/>
            Now we are to take whichever side may suit our pur­ <lb/>
            pose.</p>
          <p>Another may be deduced from the circumstance, <note type="margin"> 19. <lb/>
            xviii. <lb/>
            From the <lb/>

            that the same persons do not choose the same things <lb/>
            subsequently as before, but contrariwise; as, for in­ <lb/>
            stance, this appeal :-" If, when in banishment, we <lb/>
            fought that we might return ; shall we, now that we <lb/>
            have returned, take to flight, in order that we may <lb/>
            not fight16?" For one while they chose abiding in <lb/>
            their country at the expense of fighting ; at another, <lb/>
            the possibility of avoiding fighting at the expense of <lb/>
            non-continuance in their native land.</p>
          <p>Another element which may be resorted to is, the <note type="margin"> 20. <lb/>

            assuming <lb/>

            assertion that a thing either exists or was produced, <lb/>
            for the sake of that for which it might have existed or <lb/>
            been produced; as if some one were to give a person <lb/>
            any thing, in order that by taking it from him he <lb/>
            may annoy him. Whence also it has been said, " To <lb/>
            many, fortune, not bearing them good will, gives <lb/>
            great good luck; but it is in order that they may re­ <lb/>
            ceive the more conspicuous calamities 17." And this <lb/>
            from the Meleager of Antiphon: " Not in order that <lb/>
            they might slay the beast, but that they may become <lb/>
            witnesses, before Greece, of Meleager's valour." And <lb/>
            that insinuation in the Ajax of Theodectes, "that <lb/>
            Diomede chose Ulysses, not as any compliment, but <lb/>
            in order that his attendant might at the same time be <lb/>
            his inferior." For it is very possible that he did so <lb/>
            on this account.</p>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <note type="margin"> ing the <lb/>

            which stimulate or retard men, and the objects with <lb/>
            a view to which they both act and avoid; for these <lb/>
            are such as, if they be actually in existence, we needs <lb/>
            must proceed to action; for instance, if the under­ <lb/>
            taking be possible, and easy, and beneficial, either to <lb/>
            the person in question himself, or to his friends, or <lb/>
            pernicious to his enemies, and entailing loss on them ; <lb/>
            or if the loss be less than the object proposed 18. <lb/>
            And it is upon these considerations that orators ex­ <lb/>
            hort, and on their opposites that they dissuade ; more­ <lb/>
            over they both defend and accuse upon the ground of <lb/>
            these considerations; they rest their defences on those <lb/>
            which are used to dissuade, and their accusations on <lb/>
            those used to exhort 19. The whole system of Calippus, <lb/>
            as well as that of Pamphilus, is nothing more than <lb/>
            this element.</p>

            appear to have taken place, but which are improba­ <lb/>

            facts, had they not well nigh occurred or actually <lb/>
            done so; and that they have a yet stronger claim to <lb/>

            turned against him by the judicial speaker as circumstances <lb/>

            the explaining the cause of the mistaken notion; for <lb/>
            there is some circumstance, on account of which it <lb/>
            appears to be the case; for example, when a certain <lb/>

            the youth; when, however, the circumstance which <lb/>
            caused it had been stated, the charge was quashed. <lb/>
            And as in the Ajax of Theodectes, Ulysses tells <lb/>

            kind is, as in logic, the asserting your last proposition <lb/>
            with all the air of a conclusion, although you have <lb/>
            deduced no [legitimate] inference at all: thus, " So <lb/>

            to expressing yourself with all the air of syllogism in <lb/>

            their name;" for of all rites, the mysteries are held in <lb/>
            most esteem. Or, if any one in praising a dog, were <lb/>
            to embrace in his panegyric the dog in the heavens, <lb/>
            or Pan; because Pindar thus addresses him, "0 <lb/>

            the all-various dog of the mighty goddess." Or the <lb/>

            there should be not even a dog in the house; and <lb/>

            And the assertion, that Mercury is "communicative" <lb/>
            above all the gods, because Mercury alone is called <lb/>
            " common." And the stating that <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>, speech, is <lb/>
            most excellent; because the good are worthy of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>, <lb/>

            and com­ <lb/>

            jointly what is true separately; or separately, what <lb/>

            same, the orator should practise whatever method is <lb/>
            more available to his purpose. The saying of Eu­ <lb/>
            thydemus is neither more nor less than an instance <lb/>
            of this; the declaration, for instance, that "he knew <lb/>
            there was a galley in the Piraeus 1," for he knew each <lb/>
            [separate fact of his assertion]. And to declare of <lb/>
            one who knows the constituent letters, " that he knows <lb/>
            the verse 2;" for the verse is the same thing. Again, <lb/>
            the saying that " as twice so much is prejudicial, he <lb/>
            denied that the one was wholesome; for it is absurd <lb/>
            that two good things should constitute one that is <lb/>
            noxious." Thus enunciated, it is adapted to refuta­ <lb/>

            have been done ?" for, taking the cases conjointly, <lb/>
            perhaps it is no longer just. This may also come <lb/>
            under the fallacy of omission, for it is not explained <lb/>

            not done the deed; or, (supposing it be the accuser <lb/>
            who gets into a passion,) that he has done it. Thus <lb/>
            then there is no enthymem ; for the hearer is sophis­ <lb/>
            tically brought over to a belief either that [the ac­ <lb/>

            this also is illogical; as if one were to say, " Lovers <lb/>

            a robber, for he is a wicked man;" for this also is <lb/>
            illogical, because not every wicked man is a thief, <lb/>
            although every thief is a wicked man. <note type="footnote"> 3 The fallacy consists in this, that it leads you to suppose <lb/>

            6th. From <lb/>
            the acci­ <lb/>
            dents of a <lb/>
            thing. </note> <lb/>
            cumstance; exemplified in that which Polycrates6 <lb/>
            said about mice, that " they lent their aid by gnaw­ <lb/>
            ing through the [enemy's] bowstrings." Or sup­ <lb/>
            posing one to declare, "that the being bidden to <lb/>
            supper is the most honourable; for Achilles was <lb/>
            wroth, on account of his not being invited by the <lb/>
            Greeks at Tenedos:" he however was enraged, as <lb/>
            though he was treated with disrespect, and this <lb/>
            occurred upon his not being invited.</p>
          <p>Another arises from establishing the consequent; <note type="margin"> 7. <lb/>
            6th. From <lb/>
            asserting <lb/>
            that as a <lb/>
            logical <lb/>
            property <lb/>
            which is <lb/>
            not. </note> <lb/>
            as in the oration respecting Paris, [it is contended] <lb/>
            that " he is of a noble spirit; because, despising <lb/>
            the society of many, he abode on Ida by himself <lb/>
            for, because the noble-spirited are thus disposed, <lb/>
            he, too, it should seem, is noble-spirited. Again, <lb/>
            " Since he is both foppish in his dress, and strolls <lb/>
            about by night, he is an adulterer;" because adul­ <lb/>
            terers are persons of such habits7. Similar to <lb/>
            this is also the argument, that the poor, because <lb/>
            they dance and sing in the temples ; and that <lb/>
            exiles, because it is permitted them to dwell where <lb/>
            they list, [are happy.]" For as these advantages <lb/>
            belong to those who appear to be happy; they too <lb/>
            would appear to be happy, to whom they belong. <lb/>
            Moreover, the case varies with the circumstances of <lb/>
            the transaction; on which account, the argument <lb/>
            falls under the charge of omission.</p>
          <p>Another arises from stating as a cause that which <note type="margin">8. <lb/>
            7th. From <lb/>
            asserting <lb/>
            that as a <lb/>

            not a <lb/>

            in fact is not; [arguing], for instance, on its having <lb/>
            happened "simultaneously," or "after;" for men do <lb/>
            assume that what occurs "subsequently," [occurs] <lb/>
            " by means of" [that which preceded], and more <lb/>
            especially those engaged in state affairs; just as <lb/>

            " manner how;" for instance, the argument " that <lb/>
            Paris carried off Helen justly; because free choice <lb/>
            had been given her by her father8;" for very pos­ <lb/>
            sibly it was not [granted] for a continuance, but <lb/>
            at first merely; because so far only was she at her <lb/>
            father's disposal. Or if any one were to say, " that <lb/>
            the striking free men was an insult because under <lb/>
            all circumstances this is not the case, but when one <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">10. <lb/>
            9th. From <lb/>
            arguing. </note> Again, as in the disputations of the Sophists, there <lb/>
            arises an apparent syllogism from stating things ab­ <lb/>
            solutely or not absolutely, but conditionally ; as [it is <lb/>
            contended] in logic, that " what is a nonentity, does <lb/>
            exist; because a nonentity exists as a nonentity;" <lb/>
            and that " what is unknown is known, for it is known <lb/>
            to be unknown9;" just so in rhetoric also, we have <lb/>
            an apparent enthymem from what is not absolutely <lb/>
            probable, but conditionally probable. This, however, <lb/>
            is not universally the case; as in truth Agatho re­ <lb/>
            marks, " Perhaps some one will be inclined to assert <lb/>
            this to be probable, that many improbabilities will <lb/>
            befall men:" for that which is contrary to probability <lb/>
            does occur; so that even what is contrary to proba­ <lb/>
            bility is probable 10; this, however, is not the case <lb/>
            absolutely; but just as in sophistical disputations, it <lb/>
            is the omission of the circumstances of extent, rela­ <lb/>
            tion, and place, which produces the imposition; so <lb/>
            also here [in rhetoric], it results from the things <lb/>
            being probable not absolutely, but conditionally pro- <note type="chapter"> II. </note> <lb/>

            the reasonings drawn from what is usual, or appears <lb/>

            of its not being probable, but on that of its not being <lb/>
            necessary6. Wherefore it always happens, that the <lb/>
            defendant has the advantage of the accuser, by means <lb/>
            of this piece of sophistry. For as the accuser con­ <lb/>
            structs his proof by means of probabilities (the task <lb/>
            of getting rid of the positive certainty being by no <lb/>
            means the same [in point of difficulty], as that of <lb/>
            getting rid of the probability of the charge); and as <lb/>
            that whichis merely probable, is invariably open to <lb/>
            an objection ; (for it otherwise would not be a pro­ <lb/>
            bability, but invariable and necessary;) and if this <lb/>
            method of solution have been adopted, the judge <lb/>
            supposes either that it does not amount to a proba­ <lb/>
            bility, or at least that he ought not to decide, having <lb/>
            been imposed upon in the way mentioned above; <note type="footnote"> 6 The orator must therefore show on which side the greater <lb/>
            probability lies. " There are objections," said Dr. Johnson, <lb/>

            respecting a speech; one, as to the sources out of <lb/>
            which will arise means of persuasion; a second, re­ <lb/>
            specting the style; a third, how we ought to arrange <lb/>
            the parts of a speech. On the subject of the means <lb/>
            of persuasion much has been said, as well as to how <lb/>
            many the sources are out of which [they arise], name­ <lb/>
            ly, that they are three; also, what is the nature of <lb/>
            these sources, and why they are no more: for all <lb/>
            those who decide, are persuaded either by being them­ <lb/>
            selves impressed in a certain way, or from conceiving <lb/>
            the speakers to be men of a certain character, or from <lb/>
            the matter of fact having been proved1.</p>
          <p>It has been stated also with respect to enthymems, <lb/>
            whence we are to furnish ourselves with them; for <lb/>
            [of those sources], some are elementary propositions, <lb/>
            peculiar [to the several branches of rhetoric] ; others <lb/>
            are places [of universal applicability]. It follows that <note type="chapter"> 2. </note> <lb/>
            we treat of the subject of style; for the mere being <lb/>
            in possession of what one ought to say is not enough; <lb/>
            but it is moreover necessary that we deliver it as we <lb/>
            ought; [and the doing this] contributes much to <lb/>
            your speech's appearing to be of a certain character.</p>

            sequence, but which never yet has been handled, on <lb/>
            the subject of delivery; for it was introduced into <lb/>
            tragedy and the public recitations at a late period, <lb/>
            since at first2 the poets used themselves to sustain <lb/>
            the dialogue3 in their tragedies. It is therefore plain <lb/>
            that some such power exists in relation to rhetoric, <lb/>
            as well as to poetry; which [as connected with the <lb/>
            latter art! Glauco the Teian. and some others, have <note type="margin"> 4. It con­ <lb/>

            treated of. And it depends on the voice, as to how <lb/>
            we ought to manage it in reference to each several <lb/>
            passion; when, for instance, we should employ a loud, <lb/>
            when a low, and when a moderate pitch of voice; <lb/>
            and on the manner in which we should employ its <lb/>
            tones, viz. the acute, the grave, and the intermediate; <lb/>
            and on certain rhythms in reference to each ; for the <lb/>
            points, in reference to which they conduct their in­ <lb/>
            quiries, are three, viz. the loudness of the voice, the <lb/>
            fitness of its tones, and its rhythm. Now these pro­ <lb/>
            ficients bear away nearly all the prizes in the disput­ <lb/>
            ations ; and as in the other contests4 the actors now <lb/>
            produce a greater effect than the poets, so likewise <lb/>
            do they in civil causes, owing to the depravity of <note type="margin"> 5. No art <lb/>

            to vulgar tastes5; but as the whole subject of rhetoric <note type="footnote"> 2 That the two departments of author and actor were united <lb/>

            we ought not to inquire further on the subject of <lb/>

            that the contest be carried on by means of the facts <lb/>

            stated, a point of great moment, in consequence of <lb/>
            the weak judgment of the auditor. The subject of <lb/>
            style, however, has some necessary though trifling <lb/>
            claim on our attention in every system; for the ex­ <lb/>

            not however to so great a degree [as is generally sup­ <lb/>
            posed] : all these points are however mere idea, and <lb/>
            have a reference to the auditor; wherefore it is that <lb/>
            no one teaches geometry in such a style.</p>
          <p>This art then, be it introduced when it may7, will <lb/>
            produce the same effect as that of acting. And some <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>

            livery is a gift of nature, and rather without the <lb/>
            province of art; the subject of style, however, is <lb/>
            clearly reducible to an art. Wherefore rewards are <lb/>
            bestowed in turn on those who are proficients in this, <lb/>

            their reputation by means of their style; on this <lb/>
            account the first style [of rhetoric] was formed on <lb/>
            that of poetry, witness the style of Gorgias; and <lb/>
            even at the present time the majority of ignorant <lb/>
            people fancy that such orators speak most delight- <lb/>
            fully : this however is not the case, but the style of <lb/>
            poetry and that of prose is distinct, and the result <lb/>
            shows it; for not even the writers of tragedy them­ <lb/>

            but just as they have passed from trochaic to iambic <lb/>

            are opposed and come under the same genus, that the <lb/>
            saying, for example, of a beggar, that "he prays," <lb/>
            and of one who is praying, that " he begs," (both <lb/>
            being species of asking,) is to do the thing which has <lb/>
            been mentioned ; just as Iphicrates called Callias " a <lb/>
            mere collector to the goddess, and not a bearer of the <lb/>
            torch." He however replied, "that he must needs <lb/>
            be uninitiated himself, or he would not call him a <lb/>
            collector, but a bearer of the torch." For these are <lb/>
            both services connected with the goddess; the one <lb/>
            however is respectable, while the other is held in no <lb/>
            repute. And some one [speaks of the courtiers of <lb/>
            Dionysius as] Dionysian parasites; they however <lb/>
            call themselves artificers14. And these expressions <lb/>
            are both metaphors; the one of persons who would <lb/>
            depreciate, the other the contrary. Even robbers, <lb/>
            now-a-day, call themselves purveyors15. On which <lb/>

            assigning names out of the number of kindred ob­ <lb/>

            are akin, as in that approved enigma, <lb/>

            sists, as Licymnius observes, in the sound or in the <lb/>

            there is moreover a third 22, which does away the so­ <lb/>

            the using one expression instead of another, carries <lb/>
            with it the same meaning:" for this is a fallacy; <lb/>
            because some words are nearer in their ordinary <lb/>
            acceptations, more assimilated, and have more pecu­ <lb/>
            liar force of setting the object before the eyes than <lb/>
            others. And what is more, one word represents the <lb/>
            object under different circumstances from another; <lb/>
            so that we may even on this principle lay it down, <lb/>
            that one word has more or less of beauty and inele­ <lb/>
            gance than another: for although both words, [at <lb/>
            the same time,] express [properties which are] beau­ <lb/>
            tiful, as well as such as are inelegant; yet they either <lb/>
            express them not qua they are beautiful, or not qua <lb/>
            they are inelegant; or granting they do, yet they <lb/>
            express them, the one in a greater, the other in a <lb/>
            less degree. But we are to deduce our metaphors <lb/>
            from these sources;—from such as are beautiful either <lb/>
            in sound, in meaning, or [in the image they present] <lb/>

            ference, in the saying, for instance, " the rosy-fingered <lb/>
            Aurora;" rather than the purple-fingered;" or, <lb/>
            what is still worse, " the crimson-fingered."</p>
          <p>Also in the case of epithets, it is very possible to <note type="margin"> 14. Epi­ <lb/>

            used in <lb/>
            the same <lb/>

            derive one's epithets from a degrading or disgraceful <lb/>
            view of the case; for instance, " the murderer of his <lb/>

            Simonides24, when the victor in a race by mules <lb/>
            offered him a trifling present, was not disposed to <lb/>
            write, as though feeling hurt at writing on demi­ <lb/>
            asses; when, however, he offered a sufficient present, <lb/>
            he composed the poem- <lb/>

            it is possible to express the self-same thing diminu­ <lb/>
            tively. And it is the employment of diminutives <lb/>
            which renders both good and evil less; just as Aris­ <lb/>
            tophanes jests in " The Babylonians using, instead <lb/>

            " puny reproach;" and instead of " sickness," " slight <lb/>
            indisposition." We ought, however, to be careful, <lb/>
            and always keep to the mean in both cases.</p>

            four points. In the use of compound words; like <lb/>
            Lycophron2, where he says, "the many-faced hea­ <lb/>

            strictly-bound-by-oath and fully-sworn men." Or <lb/>
            like Alcidamas, [who talks of] " the soul replete with <lb/>

            the main." For all these expressions, by reason of <lb/>
            their being compounded, appear poetical3.</p>
          <p>This, then, is one cause: also the employment of <note type="margin"> 2. ii. Use <lb/>
            of foreign <lb/>
            words. </note> <lb/>
            foreign idioms is one; as when Lycophron calls <lb/>
            Xerxes, " prodigious hero," and Sciron, " baneful <lb/>
            man 4;" or Alcidamas, when he says, " gambollings in <lb/>
            poetry," and " nature's improbity," and " whetted by <lb/>
            unrestrained rage of soul."</p>
          <p>A third description of frigidity consists in the em- <note type="margin"> 3. iii. Epi­ <lb/>
            theta too <lb/>
            long, too <lb/>
            frequent, <lb/>
            or out of <lb/>
            place. </note> <lb/>
            plyment of epithets either too long, out of place, or <lb/>
            too frequent; for in poetry, indeed, it is becoming <lb/>
            enough to say " white milk;" in prose, however, it is <lb/>
            rather bad taste. Some also, should there be a su­ <lb/>
            perabundance of them, betray [the rhetorician's art], <lb/>
            and make it evident that the whole is a mere made-up <lb/>
            thing; this, however, you may occasionally avail your­ <lb/>
            self of, since it produces a departure from the ordinary <lb/>
            style, and renders the diction foreign. Yet ought we <lb/>
            to aim at the mean; for [the too free indulgence in <lb/>
            the licence] does more harm than the speaking care­ <lb/>
            lessly ; for the one has no beauty, the other has <lb/>
            [positive] fault. Hence it is that the writings of Al­ <lb/>
            cidamas appear frigid; for he employs epithets not <lb/>
            as the seasoning, but as the food, with such profusion <lb/>
            does he scatter them, and those both too long, and <lb/>
            where the meaning is self-evident: thus, he does not <lb/>
            say the sweat, but the moist sweat5:" nor to the <note type="footnote"> 3 Take the following specimen: " To so vast a height did <lb/>

            " taking nature's museum with you:" and of " rueful <lb/>

            of " the fabricator of a whole people's favour:" and of <lb/>
            " a dispenser of the pleasure of his audience." [He <lb/>
            would not tell you] of branches; but " amid the <lb/>
            branches of the wood did he conceal it:" nor, that he <lb/>
            covered his person; but " the nakedness of his per­ <lb/>

            so that it becomes poetry:) and of "such an ill­ <lb/>
            omen'd excess of improbity." Hence those who ex­ <lb/>
            press themselves with this poetic air, produce by their <lb/>
            want of taste both the ridiculous and the frigid, and <lb/>
            from their loquacious prosing, become deficient in <lb/>
            clearness ; for whenever one unnecessarily obtrudes <lb/>
            any thing on an auditor who already apprehends him, <lb/>
            putting an end to all perspicuity, he produces ob­ <lb/>

          <p>People, however, do employ compounds, when the <note type="margin"> Com­ <lb/>

            but if it occur frequently, it is decidedly poetical. <lb/>
            Wherefore a style characterized by compounds, is <lb/>
            most available to the Dithyrambic poets; for such <lb/>
            words are sonorous: exotic words are most useful to <lb/>
            epic poets6; for they have something dignified and <lb/>
            superb: metaphor however to iambic verse ; for [dra­ <lb/>

            no such gambolling in poetry:" since all these ex­ <lb/>
            pressions, for the reasons above-mentioned, are des­ <lb/>
            titute of persuasive efficacy. But what Gorgias said <lb/>
            on a swallow, when in its flight it had muted on him, <lb/>
            was in the best style of tragedy; for he exclaimed, <lb/>
            " Oh! fie Philomela;" for to a bird, indeed, the act <lb/>
            was not unbecoming, to a young lady, however, it would <lb/>
            have been. So that he reproached her neatly enough, <lb/>
            speaking of her as what she had been, not as what <lb/>
            she then was.</p>

            ence is trifling: for when [the poet] says of Achilles, <lb/>

            when he says, " A very lion he leaped on them," it is <lb/>
            a metaphor: for since both are brave, [the poet,] <note type="footnote"> 8 Such was the language of the poet who, describing the <lb/>

            The simile is useful too in prose, though seldom, since <lb/>
            it carries with it the air of poetry. And you must <lb/>
            introduce them just as you would metaphors; for <lb/>
            they are metaphors differing in that particular which <lb/>
            has been stated1.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">3. In­ <lb/>
            stances of <lb/>
            similes. </note> The following are similes ; viz. that which Andro­ <lb/>

            people bite them, and Idrieus, too, now that he was <lb/>
            discharged, was a dangerous person. Again, as The­ <lb/>
            odamus, in a simile, compared Archidamus to Eux­ <lb/>
            enus, without his knowledge of geometry; on the <lb/>
            principles of similar ratios: for [conversely] Euxenus <lb/>
            would be Archidamus, had [the latter] a knowledge <lb/>
            of geometry. Also the instance which occurs in the <lb/>
            Politeia of Plato, that those who spoil the dead are <lb/>
            like young dogs, " which bite the stone, without <lb/>
            touching the person who throws it." Also the [si­ <lb/>
            mile] which he employed against the populace, " that <lb/>
            it was like a pilot, strong indeed, but rather deaf." <lb/>
            And of the metres of poets, " they are like those in <lb/>

            Phædrus; in which the trees, having been made to dispute <lb/>

            deserve that destruction which they had provided for them­ <lb/>
            selves ? The Latin fabulist himself seems to think that his <lb/>
            master, Æsop, had carried matters too far in making trees <lb/>

            pulace, that " it is like those who are sea-sick when <lb/>
            on board." So, too, Democritus likened the orators <lb/>
            to nurses, " who, swallowing the sop themselves, be­ <lb/>
            smear the infants with spittle." And in the same way <lb/>
            Antisthenes likened Cephisidotus the slim to frank­ <lb/>
            incense, for " in its consumption it spreads universal <lb/>
            delight."</p>
          <p>[ Thus the simile is metaphor], for it is free to you <lb/>
            to enunciate all these both as metaphors and as si­ <lb/>

            tives. And this expedient is also approved in ana­ <lb/>
            logical metaphors; for instance, the saying of " a <lb/>

            from Harris, in illustration of the whole subject:—“ The <lb/>
            rhythm of the heroic foot is one to one, which constitutes, in <lb/>
            music, what we call common time; and in musical vibration, <lb/>
            what we call the unison. The rhythm of the iambic is one to <lb/>
            two, which constitutes, in music, what we call triple time; <lb/>
            and in musical vibration, what we call the octave. The <lb/>

            times united; and which constitutes, in musical vibration, <lb/>
            what we call the fifth. 'Twas here then they discovered the <lb/>
            foot they wanted; that foot which, being neither the heroic <lb/>
            nor the iambic, was yet so far connected with them, as to con­ <lb/>

          <p>This [pæan] makes a good conclusion; whereas the <lb/>

            should not the circumstance under narration have <lb/>
            been terminated. But it is unpleasant, from its <lb/>
            being indefinite; for all like to descry the end. <lb/>
            Wherefore it is that racers pant and faint away just <lb/>
            at the turn ; for before, while they have the goal in <lb/>

            I call a period a form of words which has independ­ <lb/>

            easily taken in at a glance. A diction of this descrip­ <lb/>

            it is pleasing from its being the opposite of that <lb/>
            which is indefinite4; and because the hearer all along <lb/>
            supposes that he is securing something, from the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance that something is constantly finished off <lb/>
            for him; but the not foreseeing nor despatching any <note type="margin"> Easily re­ <lb/>

            thing is unpleasant: and it easily conveys informa­ <lb/>
            tion, because it is easily remembered; this, however, <lb/>
            is the case, because the diction which consists of pe­ <lb/>
            riods has number, which of all things is most easily <lb/>
            recollected. And hence every one remembers verse <lb/>
            better than prose; for it has numbers by which it is <note type="margin"> 4. The pe­ <lb/>

            sense. </note> <lb/>
            measured. The period ought also to be terminated <lb/>
            with the sense, and not to be interrupted like this <lb/>
            verse of Sophocles,- <note type="margin"> 4 "While other sentences are indefinite, and (like a <lb/>

            terminates at a given point. In other words, while other sen­ <lb/>
            tences, by the help of common copulatives, have a sort of <lb/>
            boundless effusion, the constituent parts of a period have a <lb/>
            sort of reflex union, in which union the sentence is so far com­ <lb/>

            For by dividing it is possible to understand the con­ <lb/>

            But the period consisting of clauses is a mode of <lb/>
            speech perfect and distinct, and easily pronounced <lb/>
            at a breath; not, however, at the point of division, <lb/>
            like the fore-mentioned period, but altogether. And <lb/>
            a clause is one subdivision of it. By a simple period, <lb/>

            that limit of termination which he conceives within <lb/>

            to the impulse backward. Those, however, which <note type="margin"> Nor pro­ <lb/>

            are prolix cause the hearer to be left behind; just <lb/>

            with them 6; and in a similar way, periods which are <lb/>
            prolix grow into an oration, and are something like <lb/>
            a desultory ode. So that that occurs which Demo­ <lb/>
            critus, the Chian, joked Melanippides about, viz. that <lb/>
            he produced desultory odes instead of anti strophes. <lb/>
            "A man in framing a nuisance for others, frames <lb/>

            appropriate enough to hold such language as this <lb/>

            ed on similar ratios; just as Pericles said, that the <lb/>

            Cephisodotus, when Chares was eager to present the <lb/>
            accounts about the Olynthiac war, grew nettled, and <lb/>
            said, " Now that he has got the populace with their <lb/>
            necks in a halter, he is endeavouring to present his <lb/>
            accounts." Again, when he once was exhorting the <lb/>
            Athenians, as they were going for provisions, to go <lb/>
            to Eu bœa for them, he said, " the decree of Miltiades <lb/>
            should go forth to the expedition." And Iphicrates, <lb/>
            when the Athenians had made a league with Epidau­ <lb/>
            rus and the neighbourhood of the coast, was indig­ <lb/>
            nant, and exclaimed that, " of themselves they had <note type="footnote"> (i. e. its figure, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>,) or its single words, (i. e. what is <lb/>

            ‘‘the eye-sore of the Piræus.” And Mcerocles said, <lb/>
            " that he was no more a knave than the other," nam­ <lb/>
            o ing some good sort of man; " since that person in­ <lb/>

            And that iambic verse of Anaxandrides on his <lb/>

            And that saying of Polyeuctus about one Speusippus, <lb/>

            keep quiet, bound as he was by fortune in a complete <lb/>
            pillory of a disease." Cephisodotus, too, used to call <lb/>
            the triremes, " painted corn-mills:” as did the Cynic <lb/>
            Diogenes the taverns, " the public tables 12 of Athens." <lb/>
            Æsion, too, used the expression, "pouring out the <lb/>
            city into Sicily," (for this is metaphorical, and sets <lb/>
            the object before the eyes,) " so that all Greece ex­ <lb/>
            claimed and this too is in a certain way a metaphor, <lb/>

            on their guard, " lest they rendered their very popu­ <lb/>
            lar assemblies so many rows;" just as Isocrates, also, <lb/>
            [ used the expression] of persons “ making a row in the <lb/>
            general convention." And as in the funeral speech <lb/>
            [of Lycias], " there was reason for Greece to shear <lb/>
            her locks over the grave of those who fell at Salamis, <lb/>
            since her liberty had been buried jointly with their <lb/>
            valour:" for had he said that " there was reason she <lb/>
            should weep, her liberty having been buried with <lb/>
            them;" it would indeed have been a metaphor, and <lb/>
            have given personification; but the words, "their <lb/>
            valour," “ her liberty," convey a kind of antithesis. <lb/>
            And, as Iphicrates said, " The path of my arguments <lb/>
            is through the midst of the actions of Chares:" the <lb/>
            metaphor here is on similar ratios, and the expres­ <lb/>
            sion, " through the midst," produces personification. <lb/>
            Also the saying, " that he challenged dangers to be <lb/>
            his allies against dangers," is both a personification <lb/>
            and a metaphor. And Lycoleon, pleading for Cha­ <lb/>
            brias, said, " [What, not pardon him] out of a respect <lb/>
            for the suppliancy13 of his brazen statue:" for in the <lb/>
            then crisis it was a metaphor, but not always; but <lb/>
            the personification [was perpetual] ; for pending his <lb/>
            trial the statue acts as suppliant, the inanimate as an <lb/>
            animated object,—" that memento of the exploits of <lb/>
            the state." Again, " Making it their study, by every <lb/>
            means, to think meanly;" [this is metaphorical,] since <lb/>
            study is with a view to advance [not to diminish]. <lb/>
            And the expression that “ God has kindled the intel­ <lb/>
            lect as a light in the soul for both in a certain sense <lb/>
            illuminate.—“ For we put no period to our wars, but <lb/>

            headed some Athenian troops auxiliary to the Bœotians, and <lb/>
            completely succeeded in repulsing the forces of Agesilaus. <lb/>

              this description, are alike things of the future. And <lb/>
              again, the declaring " that a truce was a trophy more <lb/>
              splendid than those won in war; since the latter was <lb/>
              the result of a trivial occurrence or a single accident, <lb/>
              the former were the result of the whole tenour of <lb/>

              victory. And, that " states pay a heavy punishment <lb/>

              of hurt consonant to justice 14.</p>
          <p>Thus, then, it has been stated that the elegancies <lb/>
            result from metaphor constructed on similar ratios, <lb/>
            and from personification.</p>

            of them produce the setting before the eyes: for in­ <lb/>
            stance, the saying of “ a good man," that he is " a <lb/>
            cube 1,” is a metaphor; for both are perfect; but this <lb/>
            does not personify: whereas the speaking of one as <lb/>
            " having his prime yet blooming," is a personification. <lb/>
            And this, “—but you just as a thing let loose," is a <lb/>
            personification. And [in the line] " Then the Greeks <lb/>
            springing forth with their feet 2;—” the expression, <lb/>
            " springing," is both a personification and a metaphor, <lb/>
            for it expresses rapidity. Again, as Homer has in <note type="footnote"> 14 We cannot forbear adding to this long catalogue the <lb/>
            metaphor used by Herodotus, in speaking of the scheme for <lb/>

            things as animate, by means of a metaphor; and in <lb/>
            all from their producing personification, they are <lb/>
            approved; as in these instances3: <lb/>
            " Back to the plain still roll'd the shameless stone." <lb/>
            Again, <lb/>
            " The arrow fle<foreign xml:lang="grc">ω</foreign>.” And, " Eager to wing its way." <lb/>
            And, <lb/>
            " Deep fix'd in earth, eager their blood to drain." <lb/>
            And, <lb/>
            " Right through his breast th' impetuous weapon sped." <lb/>
            For in all these instances, the objects, from their <lb/>
            being animated, appear personified; for the expres­ <lb/>
            sions, shamelessness, and eagerness, and the rest, <lb/>
            are personifications. These, however, has he ap­ <lb/>
            pended by means of the metaphor from analogy : for <lb/>
            as the stone is to Sisyphus, so is he who is insensible <lb/>
            of shame, to the object in regard to which he is so <note type="margin"> 4. And <lb/>
            similes. </note> <lb/>
            insensible. He does this, too, in his approved similes, <lb/>
            in the case of inanimate objects ; as, <lb/>
            " The waves behind impel the waves before, <lb/>
            Wide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore4." <lb/>
            for he produces every thing in life and action. But <lb/>
            personification is an imitation [of nature 5 ]. <note type="margin"> 5. Meta­ <lb/>

            the point of similitude6; as when Archytas observes, <lb/>

            to both does the party who has been wronged fly <lb/>
            for refuge. Or if one were to say, " that an anchor <lb/>
            and a pot-hanger were the same;" for both are some­ <lb/>
            what the same, but they differ in the circumstance <lb/>
            of suspending from above and below. Again, the <lb/>
            expression, " the states have been levelled" is the <lb/>
            same in objects widely differing, equality both in <lb/>
            power and in superficies.</p>
          <p>Also the greatest number of elegancies arise from <note type="margin"> 6. They <lb/>

            metaphor, and from additionally deceiving the hear­ <lb/>

            learnt something, from the meaning being the oppo­ <lb/>
            site [of what it was supposed], and the mind seems <lb/>
            to say, " How true is this ! I however was wrong." <lb/>
            And the elegancies of proverbial expressions arise <lb/>

            the words of Stesichorus, that " the grasshoppers <lb/>
            shall chirp on the ground 8." Also ideas neatly put <lb/>
            enigmatically, are for the same reason pleasing; for <lb/>
            there is an acquisition of knowledge, and a metaphor <lb/>
            is introduced. Again, that embellishment which <note type="margin"> Para­ <lb/>
            doxes. </note> <lb/>
            Theodorus calls, " saying out-of-the-way things;" <lb/>
            this, however, occurs when the sentiment is paradox­ <lb/>
            ical, and (as he has it) does not square with previous <lb/>
            opinion 9; just on the same principle as in jokes, <lb/>
            words submitted to a slight change. An effect which <note type="margin"> Jests <lb/>

            those jests also produce, which depend on the change <note type="footnote"> 7 Besides the ornament of metaphor, by leading the hearer, <lb/>
            throughout the sentence, to expect something very different <lb/>
            from what you really mean, and undeceiving him only by the <lb/>
            last word; e. g. " Quid hinc abest nisi reset virtus!" <lb/>
            Cic. de Orate ii. 70. Here you expect a panegyric; the last <lb/>
            word converts the whole into reproach. Of this description, <lb/>
            too, are the following lines of Pope :— <lb/>

            Dost sometimes counsel take, and sometimestea !" <lb/>
            Rape of the Lock, iii. 7. <lb/>
            The precept may be further illustrated by Porson's insidious <lb/>

            the word expresses, but what its inversion signifies : <lb/>

            " Thee did a Thracian —" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θράττη</foreign>) ; for what he <lb/>

            deceives the audience ; wherefore to one who has <lb/>

            two excellent replies to taunts of this nature; one made by <lb/>
            Mnestheus, son of Iphicrates, who declared that he esteemed <lb/>
            his mother above his father,—" Nam Pater, quantum in se <lb/>
            fuit, Thracem me genuit: contra ea, mater Atheniensem <lb/>
            (Corn. Nep. Iphic. 3;) where it should be observed, that Rut­ <lb/>
            gersius, for contra ea mater, proposes to read cum Thraca ma­ <lb/>
            ter. The other is attributed to Timotheus, who having the <lb/>
            condition of his mother as a Thracian slave thrown out against <lb/>
            him as a reproach, replied, " But to her I owe it that I am <lb/>
            Conon's son." Athenæus, lib. xii. </note> <pb n="243"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴ</foreign>) of evils." For in either acceptation, that is <lb/>
            stated which one did not imagine he would say; and <lb/>
            that it is true, is acknowledged. For to assert that a <lb/>
            beginning is a beginning, shows no great wisdom; <lb/>
            but he repeats [the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀ</foreign>p<foreign xml:lang="grc">χὴ</foreign>], not in this sense, <lb/>
            but differently ; and he does not repeat the same <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴ</foreign> which he first said, but in a different sense. <lb/>
            And in all these cases, if one introduce the term <note type="chapter"> 8. </note> <lb/>
            appropriately under an equivocation or metaphor, <lb/>
            then there is wit; for instance, there is no bearing <lb/>
            Baring 13: here the speaker denies the correspond­ <lb/>
            ence of signification, but appropriately enough, if <lb/>
            [tbe person alluded to] be disagreeable." Again, <lb/>
            " You cannot become more a stranger [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>], than <lb/>
            becomes you as a guest [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>]," or not in a greater <lb/>
            degree than you ought, which is the same; and " it <lb/>
            becomes not a stranger [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>] always to be a guest <lb/>
            [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>]." For the meanings here also are different. <lb/>
            The same, too, is that commended saying of Anax­ <lb/>
            andrides, " It is honourable to die before doing aught <lb/>
            worthy death;" for it is the same as saying, " It is <lb/>
            worthy a man to die when he is not worthy to suffer <lb/>
            death;" or, " It is worthy a man to die when he is <lb/>
            not worthy [the punishment] of death; or, when he <lb/>
            has not committed acts worthy that punishment." <lb/>
            Now the form of the diction of these sentences is the <note type="chapter"> 9. </note> <lb/>
            same; but in proportion as [the ideaj happens to be <lb/>
            enunciated in fewer words and with antithesis, in the <lb/>
            same proportion is it more approved. And the rea­ <lb/>
            son is, that the information becomes by means of the <lb/>
            antithesis, fuller; by means of brevity, more rapid. <lb/>
            Such sentiments ought always to have either some <note type="margin"> 10. There <lb/>

            one of whom they are said, or happiness of expres­ <lb/>
            sion (if what you say [would appear] earnest, and <lb/>
            not mere idle remark) ; for it is possible to have one <lb/>
            of those qualities without the other: for instance, <lb/>
            " You ought to die without having committed an <lb/>
            error;" [the sentiment is just enough], but [the ex­ <lb/>
            pression] is not elegant: " A deserving man should <note type="footnote"> 13 So, too, the Latins, Lepidus non lepidus. </note> <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <pb n="244"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>

            time, as " It is worthy a man to die while he is not <lb/>
            worthy of suffering death." But in proportion as a <lb/>
            sentence possesses the greater number of these orna­ <lb/>
            ments, in the same proportion does it appear more <lb/>
            elegant; if, for instance, the words be metaphors, <lb/>
            and metaphors of such a species, and if there be <lb/>
            antithesis, and equipoise of clauses, and if it have <lb/>
            personification.</p>

            foregoing, are in some way approved metaphors; for <lb/>
            they always are expressed in two terms, like the ana­ <lb/>
            logical metaphor; thus, " the shield," we say, " is <lb/>
            the cup of Mars the bow, " a stringless lyre." Thus, <lb/>
            then, persons express the metaphor not unaccom­ <lb/>

            shield " a cup," is without accompanying explan- <note type="chapter"> 12. </note> <lb/>
            ation 16. And on this principle men construct their <lb/>
            similes ; for instance, that of a flute-player to an <lb/>

            lamp; for both contract themselves. But the excel­ <lb/>
            lence will exist when there is a metaphor; for you <lb/>
            may represent by a simile the shield as " the cup of <lb/>
            Mars," and a ruin as " the rags of a house ;" and the <lb/>
            saying of Niceratus, that, " he was himself a Philoc­ <lb/>

            In which points, if they be not neatly managed, the <lb/>
            poets most frequently get hissed off, even should <lb/>
            they in other respects stand high. I mean when the <lb/>
            poet replies [to his particle of similitude thus], <lb/>
            "Like parsley he has crooked legs."—"Like Phi­ <lb/>
            lammon on the bench, struggling with the ball" [or, <lb/>
            with Corycus]. And all such expressions are si­ <lb/>
            miles ; but that similes are metaphors has frequently <lb/>
            been stated.</p>
          <p>Proverbs also are metaphors from species to spe- <note type="margin"> 14. And <lb/>

            a benefit, should himself introduce a measure and <lb/>
            afterwards suffer loss from it, then one exclaims, <lb/>
            " As the Carpathian fetched the hare 18 !" for both <lb/>
            parties have experienced the thing in point. Now <lb/>
            the sources whence these elegancies are deduced, and <lb/>

            of disputation even the rhetoricians employ them, for <lb/>
            they are adapted to declamation. Yet it is necessary <note type="chapter"> 3. </note> <lb/>
            in repeating the same thing to vary the expression ; <lb/>
            which indeed opens a way, as it were, to declamation: <lb/>
            [e. g.] " This is he who robbed you ; this is he who <lb/>
            defrauded you ; this is he who at last endeavoured to <lb/>
            betray you." Just as Philemon the actor used to do <lb/>
            in the " Gerontomania " of Anaxandrides, when Rha­ <lb/>
            damanthus and Palamedes speak; and in the opening <lb/>
            scene of the " Devotees " [in the recurrence of] the <lb/>
            word I. For if one does not give these passages with <lb/>
            declamation, it becomes [a case in point with the pro­ <lb/>
            verb] " Stiff as one carrying a beam." And so also <note type="chapter"> 4. </note> <lb/>
            where connectives are wanting, "I came, I met, I <lb/>
            besought him;" for you needs must give it with de­ <lb/>
            clamation, and not, as though simply saying one thing, <lb/>
            enunciate it with the same manner and tone. There <lb/>
            is, moreover, a certain peculiarity which omissions of <lb/>
            connectives possess; for it strikes one that, in an <lb/>
            equal length of time, many things have been stated ; <lb/>
            for the connective makes many, one ; so that if it be <lb/>
            taken away, it is evident that on the contrary one <lb/>
            will be many. It possesses, then, amplification ; " I <lb/>
            came, I conversed with, I besought," being many,— <lb/>
            " he seems to overlook all I have said, all I now say." <lb/>
            Homer is desirous of producing this effect in the <lb/>
            lines: <lb/>
            " Three ships with Nireus sought the Trojan shore, <lb/>
            Nireus, whom Agläe to Charopus bore, <lb/>

            Wherefore for one, after stating, not to prove it, or <lb/>
            to proceed to prove it without a previous statement, <lb/>
            is out of the question: for whoever proves, proves <lb/>
            something; and he who makes a previous statement, <lb/>
            makes such statement with a view to subsequently <lb/>

            ridiculous; for narration is a kind of peculiarity to <lb/>

            self ; 2. his hearer; 3. the subject; 4. and from the <lb/>
            adversary. Every thing whatsoever which refers to <lb/>
            the doing away or the casting an aspersion of charac­ <lb/>
            ter, has a relation to one's self or the adversary. But <lb/>
            these things are not done exactly in the same way: for <lb/>
            by one speaking on a defence, whatever tends to asper­ <lb/>
            sion of character should be put first; but by one who <lb/>
            is laying an accusation, in his peroration. And the <lb/>
            reason why is not indistinct; for it is necessary that <lb/>
            one who is making a defence, when he is about to in­ <lb/>
            troduce himself, should sweep away every stumbling­ <lb/>
            block ; so that the prepossession against you must first <lb/>
            be removed: by him, however, who raises the un­ <lb/>
            favourable impression, let it be raised in winding up, <lb/>
            in order that the judges may the rather recollect it.</p>
          <p>The correctives, however, which refer to the hearer, <note type="margin"> ii. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ τοῡ <lb/>

            times convenient to render him attentive, for which <lb/>
            reason many endeavour to induce them to laughter. <lb/>
            But all these will conduce to tractability [on thejudge's <lb/>
            part], if one wishes it, as does also the showing one's <lb/>
            self a person of character; for to such do people the <lb/>
            rather give heed. But men are attentive to objects <lb/>
            of importance, of a peculiar description, or deserving <lb/>
            admiration, or pleasing. Hence we ought to throw <lb/>
            in a hint that the speech is concerning subjects of <lb/>

            you may attempt a commutation of motives; e. g. <lb/>
            " that he did not wish to hurt, but to do this or that, <lb/>
            and not what the accuser insinuated; but that it so <lb/>

            ates that " he is of kin to Priam; for [his mother] <lb/>
            Hesione was Priam's sister." He, however, replies <lb/>
            on the ground that, " Telamon, his father, was the <lb/>
            enemy of Priam, and that he did not denounce the <lb/>
            spies."</p>
          <p>Another, peculiar to an accuser, is, for one after <note type="margin"> 10. <lb/>

            bestowing short praise to censure at great length, <lb/>
            putting forward great virtues briefly, or very many <lb/>
            [which are not relevant], then to censure in one <lb/>
            point which bears home upon the case. Such me­ <lb/>
            thods are the most crafty and malignant; for they <lb/>
            attempt injury by means of one's virtues, by blend­ <lb/>
            ing them with a man's failings.</p>
          <p>But it is a resource common to the calumniator <note type="margin"> xii. By <lb/>

            suit your <lb/>

            and one who meets a calumny, that, as it is possible <lb/>
            for the same action to have been done from many <lb/>
            motives, by the calumniator, indeed, facts should be <lb/>
            taken in a bad sense, as he makes his selection of <lb/>
            motives on the worse side; while by the respondent <note type="footnote"> 2 Hippolytus, 612. </note><note type="footnote"> S </note> <pb n="258"/>

            it should be made on the better. Take, for instance, <lb/>
            the fact that Diomede chose Ulysses: one will say <lb/>
            it was, "because he conceived Ulysses to be the <lb/>
            bravest;" the other, that " it was not, but because <lb/>
            he alone could not become a rival, such a poltroon <lb/>
            was he."</p>

            in continuity, but in scattered portions ; for one must <lb/>
            go over the actions out of which the speech arises: <lb/>
            for a speech is a kind of compound, having one por­ <lb/>
            tion, indeed, independent of art, [since the speaker is <lb/>
            not at all the cause of the actions themselves,] and <lb/>
            another portion originating in art; and this last is <lb/>
            either the showing that it is fact should it be incredi­ <lb/>
            ble, or such either in character or degree, or in show- <note type="chapter"> 2. </note> <lb/>
            ing all these points at once. Owing to this, there are <lb/>
            times when one ought not to narrate every fact suc­ <lb/>
            cessively ; because this mode of exposition is difficult <lb/>
            to remember. From some, then, establish the cha­ <lb/>
            racter for courage, from others for wisdom, and from <lb/>
            others for justice. The one style of narration is too <lb/>
            simple ; the other has the grace of variety, and is not <note type="chapter"> 3. </note> <lb/>
            so void of elegance. But you have only to awaken <lb/>
            the recollection of facts well known; on which ac­ <lb/>
            count, many subjects will stand in no need of narra­ <lb/>
            tion : supposing, for instance, you would praise <lb/>
            Achilles, because all are acquainted with his actions ; <lb/>
            but you must employ them at once. But in praising <lb/>
            Critias, an orator must narrate; for not many are <lb/>
            acquainted with his exploits.</p>

            the narration should be rapid. And yet I would say, <lb/>

            said he, " is it then impossible to knead it properly ? <lb/>
            And so here [in rhetoric a mean is to be observed]. <lb/>
            For one should not narrate at too great length, just <lb/>
            as he should not make too long an exordium, nor <lb/>
            state his proofs [too fully]. For neither in this case <lb/>
            does propriety consist either in rapidity or concise­ <lb/>
            ness, but in a mean betwixt both: and this is the <lb/>
            stating just so much as will make the matter clear, <lb/>
            or as will cause one to conceive that it has taken <lb/>
            place, or that the party has inflicted hurt, or com­ <lb/>
            mitted injustice, or that the case is of that importance <lb/>
            which the speaker wishes to establish; and to the <lb/>
            opposite party the opposite points will avail. And <note type="margin"> 5. and <lb/>

            orator. </note> <lb/>
            an orator should narrate, by the bye, such incidents <lb/>
            as conduce to his own excellence: thus, " I all along <lb/>
            used to instruct them in what was just, bidding them <lb/>
            not to abandon their children,"—or, to the villany <lb/>
            of the other party;- " -but he replied to me, that <lb/>
            wherever he might be he should have other children." <lb/>
            Which, Herodotus says, was the reply of the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians on their revolting. Or whatever is pleasing <lb/>
            to the judges.</p>
          <p>In the case of a defendant, the matter will be more <note type="margin"> 6. The <lb/>

            </note>brief; the points for dispute being, either that it has <lb/>
            not taken place, or is not hurtful, or not unjust, or <lb/>
            not of such importance. So that on acknowledged <lb/>
            points he need not pause, unless they conduce in <lb/>
            some degree to the objects suggested; e. g. if the <lb/>
            fact be acknowledged, but its injustice disputed. <lb/>
            Moreover, you should mention as already done those <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            things which, in the course of being done, failed of <lb/>
            producing pity or horror. The story of Alcinous <lb/>
            is an instance, which is despatched to Penelope in <lb/>
            sixty verses. And as Phäyllus does in the circle, <lb/>
            and the opening scene of the CEneus. The narra- <note type="margin"> 8. and <lb/>

            this will be secured, if we know what gives rise to <lb/>
            the moral character. One source is the manifesta­ <lb/>
            tion of deliberate choice; and of what kind is moral <note type="footnote">1 See Herodotus, ii. 30. </note> <note type="footnote"> S 2 </note> <pb n="260"/>

            character we ascertain from knowing of what kind <lb/>
            this is; and of what kind the deliberate choice is, <lb/>
            from being acquainted with its proposed end. Hence <lb/>
            the doctrines of mathematics have no display of cha­ <lb/>
            racter, for neither have they deliberate choice; and <lb/>
            this for that they have not the influence of motive 2: <lb/>

            they treat concerning subjects of this kind. But <lb/>
            those things convey a notion of character, which is <lb/>
            consequent upon the several characters 3; e. g. <lb/>
            " Whilst saying this he began to hasten off for <lb/>
            this manifests a hardihood and rusticity of character. <lb/>
            And be cautious not to speak coldly as from the un­ <lb/>
            derstanding merely, as orators do now-a-days, but <lb/>
            as though from the deliberate choice 4. " I, for I <lb/>
            wished and deliberately preferred this; and if I pro­ <lb/>
            fit nothing by it, then it is the more honourable:" <lb/>
            for the one is characteristic of a prudent, the other <lb/>
            of a good man : since [the proposed end] of the pru­ <lb/>
            dent consists in pursuing the expedient; of a good <lb/>
            man, in pursuing what is honourable. And should <lb/>
            any circumstance be incredible, you must subjoin the <lb/>
            reason; as Sophocles does. He furnishes an exam­ <lb/>
            ple in the Antigone, that she mourned more for her <lb/>
            brother than for a husband or children; for these, if <lb/>

            what the rhetoricians at Athens do, and particularly <lb/>
            Isocrates; for in the course of deliberative speaking <lb/>

            if his question produce that conclusion, you are to <lb/>

            rejoined the other, " seemed it not to you to be <lb/>
            wrong ?" He said it did. " Did you not, then, do <lb/>
            that which was wrong?" “Yes, forsooth," replied <lb/>
            he, " for I had no better alternative." And as the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian, when called to an account respecting <lb/>
            his ephorship, on having the question put, " Whether <lb/>
            the rest appeared to him to have perished justly," <lb/>
            said they did. " Then," retorted the other, " did you <lb/>
            not enact the same things as they ? " And when he <lb/>
            acknowledged that he had, " Would not you also," <lb/>
            asked the other, "justly perish?" "No, indeed," <lb/>
            said he, " for they did this on a bribe; I did not, but <lb/>
            merely from judgment." Wherefore one ought not <note type="margin">No ques­ <lb/>

          <p>But with respect to Ridicule, inasmuch as it seems <note type="margin"> 7. Ridi­ <lb/>

            to be used. </note> <lb/>
            to possess a kind of use in disputation2, and as "one <lb/>

            of our adversary by ridicule, and his ridicule by sober <lb/>
            earnestness," making the remark justly enough,-it <lb/>
            has been stated in the Poetic3 how many species of <lb/>
            ridicule there are; whereof, some befit the gentle­ <lb/>
            man, others do not: so that each must see to it that <lb/>

            the buffoon for that of another. <note type="footnote"> 2 " Ridiculum acri <lb/>

            hearers <lb/>
            favour­ <lb/>
            ably. </note> THE peroration is composed of four things:—of get­ <lb/>
            ting the hearer favourable to one's self, and ill-dis­ <lb/>
            posed towards the adversary; and of amplification <lb/>
            and extenuation; and of placing the hearer under the <lb/>
            influence of the passions; and of awakening his re­ <lb/>
            collection.</p>
          <p>For after showing yourself to be on the right side, <lb/>
            and your adversary on the wrong, it naturally follows <lb/>
            to praise and blame, and to give the last finish. And <lb/>
            one of two things the speaker ought to aim at, either <lb/>
            to show that he is good relatively to them, [the audi­ <lb/>
            ence,] or is so absolutely; and that the other party <lb/>
            is bad, either relatively to them, or absolutely. And <lb/>
            the elements, out of which one ought to get up per­ <lb/>
            sons as of such characters, have been stated; both <lb/>
            whence one should establish them as bad, and whence <note type="margin"> 2. ii. We <lb/>

            diminish. </note> <lb/>
            as good. Next to this, these points having been <lb/>
            already shown, it follows naturally to amplify or <lb/>
            diminish: for the facts must needs be acknowledged, <lb/>
            if one be about to state their quantity; for the in­ <lb/>
            crease of bodies is from substances previously exist­ <lb/>
            ing. But the elements, out of which one must <lb/>
            amplify and diminish, are above set forth.</p>

            must ex­ <lb/>

            nature and degree, it follows that we excite the <lb/>
            hearer to passion; such as are, pity, terror, anger, <lb/>
            hatred, envy, emulation, and contentiousness: the <lb/>
            elements of these also have been stated above.</p>

            of what has been before stated. And this we are to <lb/>
            do here, in the way in which some erroneous teach­ <lb/>
            ers say we should in the exordium: for in order that <lb/>
            the facts may be readily perceived, they bid us state <lb/>

            trial turns; here, however, [in the peroration,] <lb/>

            one has made good what he undertook; so that it will <lb/>

            what reasons. And it is expressed either by means <lb/>
            of a juxtaposition with the adversary's statements; <lb/>
            and draw the comparison either between every point <lb/>
            whatsoever, which both have stated relative to the <lb/>
            same thing; or else not by a direct opposition. " He, <lb/>
            indeed, on this subject said so and so ; but I so and <lb/>
            so, and for such reasons." Or, by a kind of banter­ <lb/>

            And, " What would he do, had he proved this, and <lb/>
            not the other point!" Or by interrogation :-" What <lb/>
            has not been fully proved on my side ?" or, " What <lb/>
            has this man established?" Either in this way, <lb/>
            then, must the speaker conclude, or he must, in <lb/>
            natural order, so state his reasoning as it was origin­ <lb/>
            ally stated; and, again, if he pleases, he may state <lb/>

            <title type="sub">That Rhetorick is an Art consisting not only in moving the Passions of the Judge; but chiefly in Proofs. And that this Art is Profitable.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WE see that all men naturally are able in some sort to accuse <lb/>
            and excuse: some by chance; but some by method. This <lb/>
            method may be discovered : and to discover Method is all one <lb/>
            with teaching an Art. If this Art consisted in Criminations <lb/>
            only, and the skill to stir up the Judges, Anger, Envy, Fear, <lb/>
            Pity, or other affections; a Rhetorician in well ordered Com­ <lb/>
            monwealths and States, where it is forbidden to digress from <lb/>
            the cause in hearing, could have nothing at all to say. For <lb/>
            all these perversions of the Judge are beside the question. <lb/>
            And that which the pleader is to shew, and the Judge to give <lb/>
            sentence on, is this only: ' Tis so: or not so. The rest hath <lb/>
            been decided already by the Law-maker; who judging of uni­ <lb/>
            versals, and future things, could not be corrupted. Besides, <lb/>
            'tis an absurd thing, for a man to make crooked the Ruler he <lb/>
            means to use.</p>
          <p>It consisteth therefore chiefly in Proofs ; which are Infer­ <lb/>
            ences: and all Inferences being Syllogismes, a Logician, if he <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            would observe the difference between a plain Syllogisme, and <lb/>
            an Enthymeme, (which is a Rhetorical! Syllogisme,) would <lb/>
            make the best Rhetorician. For all Syllogismes and Inferences <lb/>
            belong properly to Logick; whether they infer truth or pro­ <lb/>
            bability : and because without this Art it would often come to <lb/>
            pass, that evil men by the advantage of natural abilities, would <lb/>
            carry an evil cause against a good ; it brings with it at least <lb/>
            this profit, that making the pleaders even in skill, it leaves <lb/>
            the odds only in the merit of the cause. Besides, ordinarily <lb/>
            those that are Judges, are neither patient, nor capable of long <lb/>
            Scientifical proofs, drawn from the principles through many <lb/>
            Syllogismes; and therefore had need to be instructed by the <lb/>
            Rhetorically and shorter way. Lastly, it were ridiculous, to <lb/>
            be ashamed of being vanquished in exercises of the body, and <lb/>
            not to be ashamed of being inferior in the vertue of well ex­ <lb/>
            pressing the mind.</p>

          <p>RHETORICK, is that Faculty, by which we understand what <lb/>
            will serve our turn, concerning any Subject to win belief in <lb/>
            the hearer.</p>
          <p>Of those things that beget belief; some require not the help <lb/>
            of Art; as Witnesses, Evidences, and the like, which we in­ <lb/>
            vent not, but make use of; and some require Art, and are in­ <lb/>
            vented by us.</p>
          <p>The belief that proceeds from our Invention, comes partly <lb/>
            from the behaviour of the speaker; partly from the passions <lb/>
            of the hearer: but especially from the proofs of what we <lb/>
            alledge.</p>
          <p>Proofs are, in Rhetorick, either Examples, or Enthymemes, <lb/>
            as in Logick, Inductions, or Syllogismes. For an Example <lb/>
            is a short Induction, and an Enthymeme a short Syllogisme ; <lb/>
            out of which are left as superfluous, that which is supposed <lb/>
            to be necessarily understood by the hearer; to avoid pro­ <lb/>
            lixity, and not to consume the time of publick business need­ <lb/>

          <p>If he hear only, that's one kind of Oration, and is called De­ <lb/>
            monstrative.</p>
          <p>If he judge, he must judge either of that which is to come; <lb/>
            or of that which is past.</p>
          <p>If of that which is to come, there's another kind of Oration, <lb/>
            and is called Deliberative.</p>
          <p>If of that which is past; then 'tis a third kind of Oration, <lb/>
            called Judicial.</p>
          <p>So there are three kinds of Orations; Demonstrative, Ju­ <lb/>
            dicial, Deliberative.</p>
          <p>To which belong their proper times. To the Demonstra­ <lb/>
            tive, the Present; To the Judicial, the Past; and to the De­ <lb/>
            liberative, the time to come.</p>
          <p>And their proper Offices. To the Deliberative, Exhorta­ <lb/>
            tion and Dehortation. To the Judicial, Accusation and De­ <lb/>
            fence. And to the Demonstrative, Praising and Dispraising.</p>
          <p>And their proper ends. To the Deliberative, to Prove a <lb/>
            thing Profitable, or Unprofitable. To the Judicial, Just, or Un­ <lb/>
            just. To the Demonstrative, Honourable, or Dishonourable.</p>
          <p>The Principles of Rhetorick out of which Enthymemes are <lb/>
            to be drawn; are the common Opinions that men have con­ <lb/>
            cerning Profitable, and Unprofitable; Just, and Unjust; <lb/>
            Honourable, and Dishonourable; which are the points in the <lb/>
            several kinds of Orations questionable. For as in Logick, where <lb/>
            certain and infallible knowledge is the scope of our proof, the <lb/>
            Principles must be all infallible Truths: so in Rhetorick the <lb/>
            Principles must be common Opinions, such as the Judge is <lb/>
            already possessed with : because the end of Rhetorick is vic­ <lb/>
            tory ; which consists in having gotten Belief.</p>
          <p>And because nothing is Profitable, Unprofitable, Just, Un­ <lb/>
            just, Honourable, or Dishonourable, but what has been done, <lb/>
            or is to be done; and nothing is to be done, that is not possible: <lb/>
            and because there be degrees of Profitable, Unprofitable, Just, <lb/>
            Unjust, Honourable, and Dishonourable; an Orator must be <lb/>
            ready in other Principles; namely, of what is done and not <pb n="278"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            done; possible and not possible; to come and not to come ; and <lb/>
            what is Greater, and what is Lesser; both in general, and <lb/>
            particularly applyed to the thing in question ; as what is more <lb/>
            and less, generally ; and what is more profitable, and less pro­ <lb/>
            fitable, etc. particularly.</p>

            <title type="sub">Of the Subject of Deliberatives; and the Abilities that are required of him that will deliberate of Business of State.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN Deliberatives there are to be considered the Subject, where­ <lb/>
            in, and the Ends whereto the Orator exhorteth, or from which <lb/>
            he dehorteth.</p>
          <p>The Subject is always something in our own power, the <lb/>
            knowledge whereof belongs not to Rhetorick, but for the most <lb/>
            part to the Politicks; and may be referred in a manner to <lb/>
            these five heads.</p>
          <p>1. Of levying of Money. To which point he that will speak <lb/>
            as he ought to do, ought to know before-hand, the revenue of <lb/>
            the State, how much it is, and wherein it consisteth ; and also <lb/>
            how great are the necessary charges and expences of the same. <lb/>
            This knowledge is gotten partly by a man's own experience, <lb/>
            partly by relations, and accounts in writing.</p>
          <p>2. Of Peace and War. Concerning which the Counsellor <lb/>
            or Deliberator, ought to know the strength of the Common­ <lb/>
            wealth ; how much it both now is, and hereafter may be: and <lb/>
            wherein that power consisteth. Which knowledge is gotten, <lb/>
            partly by experience, and relations at home; and partly by the <lb/>
            sight of wars, and of their events abroad.</p>
          <p>3. Of the Safeguard of the Country. Wherein he only is <lb/>
            able to give counsell, that knows the forms, and number, and <lb/>
            places of the Garrisons.</p>
          <p>4. Of Provision. Wherein to speak well, it is necessary <lb/>
            for a man to know what is sufficient to maintain the State; <lb/>
            what Commodities they have at home growing; what they <lb/>
            must fetch in through need; and what they may carry out <lb/>
            through abundance.</p>
          <p>5. Of making Laws. To which is necessary so much Po­ <lb/>
            litical, or Civil Philosophy, as to know what are the several <lb/>
            kinds of Governments ; and by what means, either from with- <pb n="279"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. V.] </note> <lb/>
            out or from within, each of those kinds is preserved, or de­ <lb/>
            stroyed. And this knowledge is gotten, partly by observing <lb/>
            the several Governments in times past, by History; and part­ <lb/>
            ly by observing the Government of the times present in se­ <lb/>
            veral Nations, by Travel.</p>
          <p>So that to him that will speak in a Councell of State, there <lb/>
            is necessary this; History, Sight of Wars, Travel, Know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the Revenue, Expences, Forces, Havens, Garrisons, <lb/>
            Wares, and Provisions in the State he lives in; and what is <lb/>
            needful for that State, either to export or import.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AN Orator in Exhorting always propoundeth Felicity, or some <lb/>
            part of Felicity to be attained by the actions he exhorteth unto: <lb/>
            and in Dehortation the contrary.</p>
          <p>By Felicity, is meant commonly, Prosperity with vertue, or <lb/>
            a continual content of the life with surety. And the parts of <lb/>
            it are such things as we call good, in body, mind, or fortune ; <lb/>
            such as these that follow.</p>
          <p>1. Nobility. Which to a State or Nation is, to have been <lb/>
            antient inhabitants ; and to have had most antiently, and in <lb/>
            most number, famous Generals in the Wars, or men famous <lb/>
            for such things as fall under emulation. And to a private man, <lb/>
            to have been descended lawfully of a Family, which hath yielded <lb/>
            most antiently, and in most number, men known to the World <lb/>
            for vertue, riches, or any thing in general estimation.</p>
          <p>2. Many and good Children. Which is also publick and <lb/>
            private. Publick, when there is much youth in the State en­ <lb/>
            dued with vertue, (namely, of the body, stature, beauty, strength, <lb/>
            and dexterity : Of the mind, valour, and temperance). Pri­ <lb/>
            vate, when a man hath many such Children, both Male and <lb/>
            Female. The vertues commonly respected in Women, are of <lb/>
            the body, Beauty, and Stature; Of the mind, Temperance, and <lb/>
            Houswifery, without Sordidness.</p>
          <p>3. Riches. Which is, Money, Cattel, Lands, Houshold­ <lb/>
            stuffe; with the power to dispose of them.</p>
          <p>4. Glory. Which is, the reputation of Vertue, or of the <pb n="280"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            possession of suck things as all, or most men, or wise men <lb/>
            desire.</p>
          <p>5. Honour. Which is, the glory of benefiting, or being able <lb/>
            to benefit others. To benefit others, is to contribute somewhat, <lb/>
            not easily had, to another marts safety, or riches. The parts <lb/>
            of Honour are, Sacrifices, Monuments, Rewards, Dedication <lb/>
            of places, Precedence, Sepulchres, Statues, publicA Pensions, <lb/>
            Adorations, Presents.</p>
          <p>6. Health. Which is the being free from Diseases, with <lb/>
            strength to use the body.</p>
          <p>7. Beauty. Which is to different Ages different. To <lb/>
            Youth, strength of body, and sweetness of aspect. To Full <lb/>
            Men, strength of body fitfor the Wars, and Countenance sweet, <lb/>
            with a mixture of Terror. To Old Men, strength enough for <lb/>
            necessary labours, with a Countenance not displeasing.</p>
          <p>8. Strength. Which is the ability to move any thing at <lb/>
            pleasure of the Mover. To move, is to pull, to put off, to lift, <lb/>
            to thrust down, to press together.</p>
          <p>9. Stature. Which is then just, when a man in height, <lb/>
            breadth, and thickness of body doth so exceed the most, as ne­ <lb/>
            vertheless it be no hindrance to the quickness of his motion.</p>
          <p>10. Good old Age. Which is, that which comes late, and <lb/>
            with the least trouble.</p>
          <p>11. Many and good Friends. Which is, to have many that <lb/>
            will do for his sake that which they think will be jor his good.</p>
          <p>12. Prosperity. Which is, to have all, or the most, or the <lb/>
            greatest of those goods which we attribute to Fortune.</p>
          <p>13. Vertue. Which is then to be defined, when we speak <lb/>
            of Praise.</p>
          <p>These are the grounds from whence we exhort.</p>
          <p>Dehortation is from the contraries of these.</p>

          <p><note type="margin"> CHAP. VI.] </note> The Indisputable Principles are such as these : <lb/>
            Good, is that which we love for it self.</p>
          <p>And that, for which we love somewhat else.</p>
          <p>And that which all things desire.</p>

          <p>And that which keeps off, or destroys the contrary of any <lb/>
            of these.</p>
          <p>Also to take the Good, and reject the Evil, is Good.</p>
          <p>And to take the greater Good, rather than the less; and <lb/>

          <p>THE Colours of Good comparatively depend partly upon the <lb/>
            following Definitions of Comparatives.</p>
          <p>1. More, is so much, and somewhat besides.</p>
          <p>2. Less, is that, which and somewhat else is so much.</p>
          <p>3. Greater and more in number are laid only Comparatively <lb/>
            to Less, and Fewer in number.</p>
          <p>4. Great and Little, Many and Few, are taken Compara­ <lb/>
            tively to the Most of the same kind. So that Great and Many, <lb/>
            is that which exceeds; Little and Few, is that which is ex <lb/>
            ceeded by the Most of the same kind.</p>
          <p>Partly from the precedent Definitions of Good absolutely.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Common Opinions concerning Good Comparatively, then, are these.</title>

          <p>Greater Good is Many, than fewer, or one of those many.</p>

          <p>And that which is nearest to the end designed.</p>
          <p>And that which is Good or Evil to ones self, than that <lb/>
            which is simply so.</p>
          <p>And possible, than not possible.</p>
          <p>And that which comes toward the end of our Life.</p>
          <p>And that which we do really, than that which we do for show.</p>
          <p>And that which we would be, rather than what we would <lb/>
            seem to be.</p>
          <p>And that which is good for more purposes, is the greater <lb/>
            Good.</p>
          <p>And that which serves us in great necessity.</p>
          <p>And that which is joyned with less trouble.</p>
          <p>And that which is joyned with more delight.</p>
          <p>And of the two, that which added to a third, makes the <lb/>
            whole the greater.</p>
          <p>And that which having, we are more sensible of.</p>
          <p>And in every thing, that which we most esteem.</p>

            as we have spoken of them already in the Abstract, so we <pb n="285"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            must speak of them also in the Concrete; that is, of what is <lb/>
            Good or Evil to each sort of Commonwealth in special.</p>
          <p>The Government of a Commonwealth, is either Democracy, <lb/>
            or Aristocracy, or Oligarchy, or Monarchy.</p>
          <p>Democracy is that, wherein all men with equal right, are <lb/>
            preferred to the highest Magistracy by Lot.</p>
          <p>Aristocracy is that, wherein the highest Magistrate is <lb/>
            chosen out of those, that had the best education, according to <lb/>
            what the Laws prescribe for best.</p>
          <p>Oligarchy is that, where the highest Magistrate is chosen <lb/>
            for wealth.</p>
          <p>Monarchy is that, wherein one man hath the Government of <lb/>
            all; which Government, if he limit by Law, is called King­ <lb/>
            dom ; if by his own will, Tyranny.</p>
          <p>The end of Democracy, or the Peoples Government, is <lb/>
            Liberty.</p>
          <p>The end of Oligarchy, is the riches of those that govern.</p>
          <p>The end of Aristocracy is good Laws, and good ordering of <lb/>
            the City.</p>
          <p>The end of Monarchy, or Kings, is the safety of the People, <lb/>
            and conservation of his own Authority.</p>
          <p>Good therefore, in each sort of Government is that which <lb/>
            conduceth to these their ends.</p>
          <p>And because belief is not gotten only by proofs, but also <lb/>
            from manners; the manners of each sort of Commonwealth <lb/>
            ought to be well understood by him that undertaketh to per­ <lb/>
            swade or diswade in matter of State. Their manners may be <lb/>
            known by their designs; and their designs by their ends; and <lb/>
            their ends by what we see them take pleasure in. But of this <lb/>

          <p>And Vertue.</p>
          <p>Vertue is the faculty of getting and preserving that which <lb/>
            is Good; and the faculty of doing many, and great things <lb/>

          <p>The kinds of it are these; <lb/>
            1. Justice; which is a Vertue whereby every man obtains <lb/>
            what by Law is his.</p>
          <p>2. Fortitude; which is a Vertue by which a man carries <lb/>

          <p>6. Magnificence; which is a Vertue, by which a man is apt <lb/>
            to be at great cost.</p>
          <p>7. Prudence; which is an Intellectual Vertue, by which a <lb/>

          <p>Besides, in a Demonstrative Oration, the Orator must shew, <lb/>
            that he whom he praiseth, did what he praiseth unconstrain­ <lb/>
            edly, and willingly.</p>
          <p>And he does so, who does the same often.</p>
          <p>Praise, is speech, declaring the magnitude of a Vertue, <lb/>
            Action, or Work.</p>
          <p>But to praise the Work from the Vertue of the Worker, is <lb/>
            a circular proof.</p>
          <p>To Magnify and to Praise, differ in themselves, as Felicity <lb/>
            and Vertue. For Praise declares a mans Vertue ; and Mag­ <lb/>
            nifying declares his Felicity.</p>
          <p>Praise is a kind of inverted Precept. For to say, Do it be­ <lb/>
            cause 'tis good, is a Precept. But to say, He is good because <lb/>
            he did it, is Praise.</p>
          <p>An Orator in Praising must also use the forms of Amplifi­ <lb/>
            cation; such as these :</p>
          <p>He was the first that did it.</p>
          <p>The only man that did it.</p><pb n="288"/>

          <p>He did it with disadvantage of time.</p>
          <p>He did it with little help.</p>
          <p>He was the cause, that the Law ordained Rewards and <lb/>
            Honours for such Actions.</p>
          <p>Further, he that will praise a Man, must compare him <lb/>
            with others; and his actions with the actions of others; <lb/>
            especially with such as are renowned.</p>
          <p>And Amplification is more proper to a Demonstrative Ora­ <lb/>
            tion, than to any other. For here the Actions are confessed; <lb/>
            and the Orators part is only this, to contribute unto them <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>IN a Judicial Oration, which consists in Accusation and De­ <lb/>
            fence, the thing to be proved is, that Injury has been done: <lb/>
            and the heads from whence the proofs are to be drawn, are <lb/>
            these three:</p>
          <p>1. The causes that move to Injury.</p>
          <p>2. The Persons apt to do Injury.</p>
          <p>3. The Persons obnoxious, or apt to suffer Injury.</p>
          <p>An Injury is a voluntary offending of another man contra­ <lb/>
            ry to the Law.</p>
          <p>Voluntary is that which a man does with knowledge, and <lb/>
            without compulsion.</p>
          <p>The causes of Voluntary Actions are Intemperance, and a <lb/>
            Vicious disposition concerning things Desirable. As the Co­ <lb/>
            vetous man does against the Law, out of an intemperate desire <lb/>
            of Money.</p>
          <p>All Actions proceed either from the doers disposition, or <lb/>
            not.</p>
          <p>Those that proceed not from the Doers disposition are such <lb/>
            as he does by Chance, by Compulsion, or by Natural necessity.</p>
          <p>Those that proceed from the Doers disposition, are such as <lb/>
            he does by Custom, or upon Premeditation, or in Anger, or <lb/>
            out of Intemperance.</p>
          <p>By Chance are said to be done those things whereof neither <lb/>
            the Cause, nor the Scope is evident; and which are done nei- <pb n="289"/>

            ther orderly, nor always, nor most commonly after the same <lb/>
            manner.</p>
          <p>By Nature are said to be done those things, the Causes <lb/>
            whereof are in the Doer; and are done orderly, and always, <lb/>
            or for the most part after the same manner.</p>
          <p>By Compulsion are done those things, which are against <lb/>
            the Appetite, and Ordination of the Doer.</p>
          <p>By Custom those Actions are said to be done, the Cause <lb/>
            whereof is this, that the Doer has done them often.</p>
          <p>Upon Premeditation are said to be done those things which <lb/>
            are done for profit, as the End, or the way to the End.</p>
          <p>In Anger are said to be done those things which are done <lb/>
            with a purpose to Revenge.</p>
          <p>Out of Intemperance are said to be done those things which <lb/>
            are delightful.</p>
          <p>In sum, every Voluntary Action tends either to Profit or <lb/>
            Pleasure.</p>
          <p>The Colours of Profitable are already set down.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>WHEN the fact is evident, the next Inquiry is, whether it <lb/>
            be Just, or Unjust.</p>
          <p>For the Definition of Just and Unjust, we must know what <lb/>
            Law is: that is, what the Law of Nature, what the Law of <pb n="294"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            Nations; what the Law Civil, what written Law, and what <lb/>
            unwritten Law is: and what Persons, that is, what a publick <lb/>
            Person, or the City is; and what a private Person, or Citi­ <lb/>
            zen is.</p>
          <p>Unjust in the opinion of all men, is that which is contrary <lb/>
            to the Law of Nature.</p>
          <p>Unjust in the opinion of all men of those Nations which <lb/>
            traffick and come together, is that which is contrary to the <lb/>
            Law common to those Nations.</p>
          <p>Unjust only in one Common-wealth, is that which is con­ <lb/>
            trary to the Law Civil, or Law of that Common-wealth.</p>
          <p>He that is accused to have done any thing against the Pub­ <lb/>
            lick, or a private Person, is accused to do it either ignorantly, <lb/>
            or unwillingly, or in anger, or upon premeditation.</p>
          <p>And because the Defendant does many times confess the <lb/>
            fact, but deny the unjustice; as that he took, but did not steal; <lb/>
            and did, but not adultery; it is necessary to know the Defini­ <lb/>
            tions of Theft, Adultery, and all other crimes.</p>
          <p>What facts are contrary to the written Laws, may be known <lb/>
            by the Laws themselves.</p>
          <p>Besides written Laws, whatsoever is Just, proceeds from <lb/>
            Equity or Goodness.</p>
          <p>From Goodness proceeds that which we are praised, or <lb/>
            honoured for.</p>
          <p>From Equity proceed those actions, which though the writ­ <lb/>
            ten LaM command not, yet being interpreted reasonably, and <lb/>
            supplyed, seems to require at our hands.</p>
          <p>Actions of Equity are such as these,</p>
          <p>Not too rigorously to punish Errors, Mischances, or Injuries.</p>
          <p>To pardon the faults that adhere to Mankind.</p>
          <p>And not to consider the Law so much, as the Law-makers <lb/>
            mind; and not the Words so much, as the meaning of the <lb/>
            Law1.</p>
          <p>And not to regard so much the Fact, as the intention of <lb/>
            the Doer; nor part of the Fact, but the Whole; nor what the <lb/>
            Doer is, but what he has been always, or for the most part. <note type="footnote"> I For, as the Quarterly Reviewer but too justly remarks, " To violate <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>COMMON Opinions concerning Injuries comparatively, are <lb/>
            such as these:</p>
          <p>Greater is the Injury which proceed from greater Iniquity.</p>
          <p>And from which proceedeth greater damage.</p>
          <p>And of which there is no revenge.</p>
          <p>And for which there is no remedy.</p>
          <p>And by occasion of which, he that hath received the Injury, <lb/>
            hath done some mischief to himself.</p>
          <p>He does the greater Injury, that does it first, or alone, or <lb/>
            with few.</p>
          <p>And he that does it often.</p>
          <p>Greater Injury is that, against which Laws and Penalties <lb/>
            were first made.</p>
          <p>And that which is more brutal, or more approaching to the <lb/>
            actions of beasts.</p>
          <p>And that which is done upon more premeditation.</p>
          <p>And by which more Laws are broken.</p>
          <p>And which is done in the place of Execution.</p>
          <p>And which is of greatest shame to him that receives the <lb/>
            Injury.</p>
          <p>And which is committed against well deservers.</p>
          <p>And which is committed against the unwritten Law; be­ <lb/>
            cause good men should observe the Law for Justice, and not <lb/>
            for fear of punishment.</p>
          <p>And which is committed against the written Law ; because <lb/>
            he that will do Injury, neglecting the penalty set down in the <lb/>
            written Law, is much more likely to transgress the unwritten <lb/>
            Law, where there is no penalty at all.</p><pb n="296"/>

            <title type="sub">Of Proofs Inartificial.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>OF Artificial Proofs we have already spoken.</p>
          <p>Inartificial Proofs, which we invent not, but make use of, <lb/>
            are of five sorts.</p>
          <p>1. Laws. And those are Civil, or written Law: the Law <lb/>
            or Custom of Nations: and the universal Law of Nature.</p>
          <p>2. Witness. And those are such as concern Matter; and <lb/>
            such as concern Manners. Also, they be ancient, or present.</p>
          <p>3. Evidences, or Writings.</p>
          <p>4. Question, or Torture.</p>
          <p>5. Oaths. And those be either given, or taken, or both, or <lb/>
            neither.</p>
          <p>For Laws, we use them thus:</p>
          <p>When the written Law makes against us, we appeal to the <lb/>
            Law of Nature, alledging,</p>
          <p>That to be greatest Justice, which is greatest Equity.</p>
          <p>That the Law of Nature is immutable; the written Law <lb/>
            mutable.</p>
          <p>That the written Law is but seeming justice; the Laic of <lb/>
            Nature very Justice. And Justice is among those things <lb/>
            which are, and not which seem to be.</p>
          <p>That the Judge ought to discern between true and adul­ <lb/>
            terate Justice.</p>
          <p>That they are better men that obey unwritten, than written <lb/>
            Laws.</p>
          <p>That the Law against us does contradict some other Law. <lb/>
            And when the Law has a double interpretation, that is the <lb/>
            true one, which makes for us.</p>
          <p>And that the cause of the Lar being abolished, the Law <lb/>
            is no more of Validity.</p>
          <p>But when the written Law makes for us, and Equity for <lb/>
            the Adversary, we must alledge,</p>
          <p>That a man may use Equity, not as a liberty to judge <lb/>
            against the Law; but only as a security against being for­ <lb/>
            sworn, when he knows not the Law.</p>
          <p>That men seek not Equity because 'tis good simply, but be­ <lb/>
            cause good for them.</p><pb n="297"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CHAP. XVI.] </note></p>
          <p>That it is the same thing not to make, and not to use the Law.</p>
          <p>That as in other Arts, and namely in Physick, fallacies are <lb/>
            pernitious; so in a Common-wealth 'tis pernitious to use pre­ <lb/>
            texts against the Law.</p>
          <p>And that in Common-wealths well instituted, to seem wiser <lb/>
            than the Laws, is prohibited.</p>
          <p>For Witnesses, we must use them thus:</p>
          <p>When we have them not, we must stand for Presumptions, <lb/>
            and say,</p>
          <p>That in Equity sentence ought to be given according to the <lb/>
            most probability.</p>
          <p>That Presumptions are the testimony of the things them­ <lb/>
            selves, and cannot be bribed.</p>
          <p>That they cannot lye.</p>
          <p>When we have Witnesses, against him that has them <lb/>
            not, we must say,</p>
          <p>That Presumptions, if they be false, cannot be punished.</p>
          <p>That if Presumptions were enough, Witnesses were super­ <lb/>
            fluous.</p>
          <p>For Writings, when they favour us, we must say, <lb/>
            That Writings are private and particular Laws; and he <lb/>
            that takes away the use of Evidences, abolisheth the Law.</p>
          <p>That since Contracts and Negotiations pass by Writings, he <lb/>
            that bars their use, dissolves humane Society.</p>
          <p>Against them, if they favour the Adversary, we may say, <lb/>
            That since Laws do not bind, that are fraudulently made to <lb/>
            pass, much less Writings.</p>
          <p>And that the Judge being to dispense Justice, ought rather <lb/>
            to consider what is just, than what is in the Writing.</p>
          <p>That Writings may be gotten by fraud or force; but Justice <lb/>
            by neither.</p>
          <p>That the Writing is repugnant to some Law, Civil, or <lb/>
            Natural; or to Justice; or to Honesty.</p>
          <p>That 'tis repugnant to some other Writing before, or after.</p>
          <p>That it crosses some commodity of the Judge (which must <lb/>
            not be said directly, but implyed cunningly).</p>
          <p>For the Torture, if the giving of it make for us, we <lb/>
            must say,</p>
          <p>That 'tis the only testimony that is certain.</p>
          <p>But if it make for the Adversary, we may say,</p>
          <p>That men inforced by Torture, speak as well that which is <lb/>
            false, as that which is true.</p><pb n="298"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [ BOOK I. </note> That they who can endure, conceal the truth; and they <lb/>
            who cannot, say that which is false to be delivered from pain.</p>
          <p>For Oaths; he that will not put his Adversary to his</p>
          <p>Oath, may alledge, <lb/>
            That he makes no scruple to be forsworn.</p>
          <p>That by swearing, he will carry the cause; which not <lb/>
            swearing, he must lose.</p>
          <p>That he had rather trust his cause in the hand of the <lb/>
            Judge, than of the Adversary.</p>
          <p>He that refuseth to take the Oath, may say, <lb/>
            That the matter is not worth so much.</p>
          <p>That if he had been an evil man, he had sworn, and <lb/>
            carryed his cause.</p>
          <p>That to try it by swearing for a religious man against an <lb/>
            irreligious, is as hard A match, as to set a weak man against <lb/>
            a strong in combate.</p>
          <p>He that is willing to take the Oath, may pretend, <lb/>
            That he had rather trust himself, than his Adversary; and <lb/>
            that 'tis equal dealing for an irreligious man to give, and for <lb/>
            a religious man to take the Oath.</p>
          <p>That 'tis his duty to take the Oath, since he has required <lb/>
            to have sworn Judges.</p>
          <p>He that offers the Oath may pretend, <lb/>
            That he does piously commit his cause to the Gods.</p>
          <p>That he makes his Adversary himself Judge.</p>
          <p>That 'twere absurd for him not to swear, that has required <lb/>
            the Judges to be sworn.</p>
          <p>And of these are to be compounded the Forms we are to <lb/>
            use, when we would give, and not take the Oath; or take, and <lb/>
            not give ; or both give and take ; or neither give nor take.</p>
          <p>But if one have sworn contrary to a former Oath, he may <lb/>
            pretend, <lb/>
            That he was forced.</p>
          <p>That he was deceived, and that neither of these is Perjury, <lb/>
            since Perjury is voluntary.</p>
          <p>But if the Adversary do so, he may say, <lb/>
            That he that stands not to what he hath sworn, subverteth <lb/>
            humane Society.</p>
          <p>And (turning to the Judge) What reason have we to re­ <lb/>
            quire, that you should be sworn, that judge our cause; when <lb/>
            we will not stand to that we swear ourselves.</p>

          <p>ANGER is desire of Revenge, joyned with grief for that he, <lb/>
            or some of his, is, or seems to be neglected.</p>
          <p>The object of Anger is always some particular, or individual <lb/>
            thing.</p><pb n="300"/>

          <p>To Neglect, is to esteem little or nothing: and of three kinds.</p>
          <p>1. Contempt.</p>
          <p>2. Crossing.</p>
          <p>3. Contumely.</p>
          <p>Contempt, is when a man thinks another of little worth in <lb/>
            comparison to himself.</p>
          <p>Crossing, is the hinderance of another mans will without <lb/>
            design to profit himself.</p>
          <p>Contumely, is the disgracing of another for his own pastime.</p>
          <p>The common Opinions concerning Anger are therefore <lb/>
            such as follow:</p>
          <p>They are easily Angry that think they are neglected.</p>
          <p>That think they excell others; as the Rich with the Poor ; <lb/>
            the Noble with the Obscure, etc.</p>
          <p>And such as think they deserve well.</p>
          <p>And such as grieve to be hindered, opposed, or not assisted. <lb/>
            And therefore sick men, poor men, lovers, and generally all <lb/>
            that desire and attain not, are angry with those that standing <lb/>
            by, are not moved with their wants.</p>
          <p>And such as having expected good, find evil.</p>
          <p>Those that men are angry with, are, <lb/>
            Such as mock, deride, or jest at them.</p>
          <p>And such as shew any kind of Contumely, towards them.</p>
          <p>And such as despise those things which we spend most la­ <lb/>
            bour and study upon : and the more, by how much we seem <lb/>
            the less advanced therein.</p>
          <p>And our friends, rather than those that are not our friends.</p>
          <p>And such as have honoured us, if they continue not.</p>
          <p>And such as requite not our courtesie.</p>
          <p>And such as follow contrary courses, if they be our inferiours.</p>
          <p>And our friends, if they have said, or done us evil, or not <lb/>
            good.</p>
          <p>And such as give not eare to our intreaty.</p>
          <p>And such as are joyful, or calm in our distress.</p>
          <p>And such as troubling us, are not themselves troubled.</p>
          <p>And such as willingly hear or see our disgraces.</p>
          <p>And such as neglect us in the presence of our Competitors; <lb/>
            of those we admire ; of those we would have admire us ; of <lb/>

          <p>And such as forget us, or our Names.</p>
          <p>An Orator therefore must so frame his Judge or Auditor <lb/>
            by his Oration; as to make him apt to Anger: and then make <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>PITY is a perturbation of the mind, arising from the appre­ <lb/>

            and which he thinks may happen to himself, or his.</p>

            <title type="sub">Of Indignation.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>OPPOSITE in a manner to Pity in good Men, is Indignation, <lb/>
            which is grief for the prosperity of a Man unworthy.</p>
          <p>With Indignation there is always joyned a joy for the pros­ <lb/>
            perity of a Man worthy, as Pity is always with contentment <lb/>
            in the adversity of them that deserve it.</p>
          <p>In wicked Men the opposite of Pity is, <lb/>
            Envy; as also the companions thereof delight in the harm of <lb/>
            others, which the Greeks in one word have called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπικαιρεκακία</foreign>. <lb/>
            But of these in the next Chapter.</p>
          <p>Men conceive Indignation against others, not for their ver­ <lb/>
            tues, as Justice, etc.</p>
          <p>For these make Men worthy ; and in Indignation we think <lb/>
            Men unworthy.</p>
          <p>But for those goods which men indued with vertue, and <lb/>
            noble Men, and handsome Men are worthy of.</p><pb n="310"/>

            Indignation against new than antient Riches, is, that the for­ <lb/>
            mer seem to possess that which is none of theirs. But the <lb/>
            antient seem to have but their own. For with common peo­ <lb/>
            ple, to have been so long, is to be so by Right.</p>
          <p>And for the bestowing of goods incongruously: as when <lb/>
            the arms of the most valiant Achilles were bestowed on the <lb/>
            most eloquent Ulysses.</p>
          <p>And for the comparison of the inferiour is the same thing, <lb/>
            as when one valiant is compared with a more valiant; or whe­ <lb/>
            ther absolutely superiour, as when a good Scholer is compared <lb/>
            with a good Man.</p>
          <p>Apt to Indignation are, <lb/>
            They that think themselves worthy of the greatest goods, <lb/>
            and do possess them.</p>
          <p>And they that are good.</p>
          <p>And they that are ambitious.</p>
          <p>And such as think themselves deserve better what another <lb/>

          <p>Least apt to Indignation are, <lb/>
            Such as are of a poor, servile, and not ambitious Nature.</p>
          <p>Who they are that Rejoyce, or Grieve not, at the adversity <lb/>
            of him that suffers worthily, and in what occasions may be <lb/>
            gathered from the contrary of what has been already said.</p>
          <p>Whosoever therefore would turn away the Compassion of <lb/>
            the Judge, he must make him apt to Indignation; and shew <lb/>

          <p>THE Manners of Middle-aged Men, are between those of <lb/>
            Youth, and Old Men, and therefore,</p>
          <p>They neither dare, nor fear too much: but both as is fit.</p>
          <p>They neither believe all; nor reject all; but judge.</p>
          <p>They seek not only what is Honourable, nor only what is <lb/>
            Profitable; but both.</p>
          <p>They are neither Covetous, nor Prodigal; but in the mean.</p>
          <p>They are neither easily Angry; nor yet Stupid: but be­ <lb/>
            tween both.</p>
          <p>They are Valiant, and withal Temperate.</p>
          <p>And in general, whatsoever is divided in Youth, and Old <lb/>
            Men, is compounded in Middle-age.</p>
          <p>And whereof the Excess, or Defect is in Youth or Old <lb/>
            Men; the Mediocrity is in those of the Middle-age.</p>
          <p>Middle-age for the Body, I call the time from thirty to five <lb/>
            and thirty years: for the Mind, the nine and fortieth, or <lb/>

          <p>RICH Men are Contumelious and Proud. This they have <lb/>

            Money, having Money, they think they have all that is good.</p>
          <p>And Effeminate; because they have wherewithal to sub­ <lb/>
            . minister to their Lust.</p>
          <p>And Boasters of their Wealth: and speak in high terms <lb/>
            foolishly. For Men willingly talk of what they love and ad­ <lb/>
            mire ; and think others affect the same that they do: and the <lb/>
            truth is, all sorts of Men submit to the Rich.</p>
          <p>And think themselves worthy to command, having that by <lb/>
            which Men attain command.</p>
          <p>And in general, they have the Manners of Fortunate Fools.</p>
          <p>They do Injury, with intentions not to hurt, but to disgrace; <lb/>
            and partly also through Incontinence.</p>
          <p>There is a difference between New and Antient Riches: <lb/>
            for they that are newly come to Wealth have the same faults <lb/>
            in a greater degree: for New Riches are a kind of rudeness <lb/>

            some Action past): or a Similitude (which is called a Para­ <lb/>
            ble) : or a Fable (which contains some Action feigned).</p>
          <p>An Example properly so called, is this; Darius came not <lb/>
            into Greece, till he had first subdued AEgypt. Xerxes also <lb/>
            conquered AEgypt first; then afterwards crossed the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont. We ought therefore to hinder the King of Persia from <lb/>
            conquering AEgypt.</p>
          <p>A Similitude, or Parable, is such as followeth: They who <lb/>
            choose their Magistrates by Lot, are like them that choose for <lb/>
            their Champions those on whom the Lot shall fall, rather than <lb/>
            those who have the greatest strength; and for their Pilot, not <lb/>
            him that hath skill; but him whose name is drawn out of the <lb/>
            Urne.</p>
          <p>A Fable is in this manner. The Horse desiring to drive <lb/>
            out the Stag from his common pasture, took a Man to assist <lb/>
            him, and having received into his mouth a Bridle, and a Rider <lb/>
            upon his Back, obtained his intent, but became subject to the <lb/>
            Man. So you of Himera, having (in hope to be revenged of <lb/>
            your Enemies) given unto Phalaris Soveraign Authority, that <lb/>
            is to say, taken a Bridle into your Mouths ; if you shall also <lb/>
            give him a Guard to his Person, that is, let him get up upon <lb/>
            your Backs, you become his slaves presently past recovery.</p>
          <p>To find out Examples, that is, Actions done that may serve <lb/>
            our purpose, is therefore hard, because not in our power.</p>
          <p>But to find Fables and Similitudes, is easier; because by <lb/>
            conversing in Philosophy, a Man may feign somewhat in na­ <lb/>
            ture like to the case in hand.</p>
          <p>Examples, Similitudes, and Fables, where Enthymemes are <lb/>
            wanting, may serve us in the beginning of an Oration for In­ <lb/>
            ductions; otherwise are to be alledged after Enthymemes for <lb/>

            <title type="sub">Of a Sentence.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A SENTENCE is an universal Proposition concerning <lb/>
            those things which are to be desired or avoided, in the Actions <lb/>
            or Passions of the common life. As,</p>
          <p>A wise Man will not suffer his Children to be over-learned.</p><pb n="320"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [ BOOK II. </note> And is to an Enthymeme in RhetoricA, as any Proposition <lb/>
            is to a Syllogisme in Logick.</p>
          <p>And therefore a Sentence, if the reason be rendered, be­ <lb/>
            comes a Conclusion, and both together make an Enthymeme.</p>
          <p>As for Example, <lb/>
            To be over-learned, besides that it begets effeminacy, pro­ <lb/>
            cures envy. Therefore he that's wise will not suffer his Chil­ <lb/>
            dren to be over-learned.</p>
          <p>Of Sentences there be four sorts. <lb/>
            For they either require Proofs, or not: that is, are mani­ <lb/>
            fest, or not.</p>
          <p>Such as are manifest, are either so, as soon as they are ut­ <lb/>
            tered ; as,</p>
          <p>Health is a great good.</p>
          <p>Or as soon as they are considered; as,</p>
          <p>Men used to hate whom they have hurt.</p>
          <p>Such as are not manifest, are either Conclusions of Enthy­ <lb/>
            memes; as,</p>
          <p>He that's wise will not suffer his Children, etc.</p>
          <p>Or else are Enthymematical; that is, have in themselves <lb/>
            the force of an Enthymeme; as,</p>
          <p>Mortal Men ought not to carry Immortal Anger.</p>
          <p>A Sentence not Manifest, ought to be either Inferred or <lb/>
            Confirmed.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Inferred thus: ' Tis not good to be effeminately minded, nor to be envyed by ones fellow Citizens. A wise Man therefore will not have his Children over-learned.</title>
          </ab>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Confirmed thus: A wise Man will not have his Children over-learned, seeing too much Learning both softens a Mans mind, and procures him envy among his fellow Citizens.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>If a reason be added to a manifest Sentence let it be short.</p>
          <p>Sentences become not every Man; but only old Men, and <lb/>
            such as be well versed in business. For to hear a young Man <lb/>
            speak Sentences, is ridiculous; and to hear an ignorant Man <lb/>
            speak Sentences, is absurd.</p>
          <p>Sentences generally received, when they are for our pur­ <lb/>
            pose, ought not to be neglected, because they pass for truths. <lb/>
            And yet they may be denyed, when any laudable custom, or <lb/>
            humour may thereby be made appear in the Denyer.</p><pb n="321"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CHAP. XXIII.] </note> The commodities of Sentences, are two.</p>
          <p>One proceeding from the Vanity of the Hearer, who takes <lb/>
            for true universally affirmed, that which he has found for true <lb/>
            only in some particular; and therefore a Man ought to con­ <lb/>
            sider in every thing what opinion the Hearer holds.</p>
          <p>Another is, that Sentences do discover the manners and <lb/>
            disposition of the speaker; so that if they be esteemed good <lb/>
            Sentences, he shall be esteemed a good Man; and if evil, an <lb/>
            evil Man.</p>
          <p>Thus much of Sentences, what they be; of how many sorts; <lb/>
            how to be used; whom they become ; and what is their profit.</p>

            <title type="sub">Of the Invention of Enthymemes.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>SEEING an Enthymeme differs from a Logical SyUogisme, in <lb/>
            that it neither concludes out of every thing, nor out of re­ <lb/>
            mote Principles; the Places of it, from whence a Man may <lb/>
            argue, ought to be certain, and determinate.</p>
          <p>And because whosoever makes a Syllogisme Rhetorical, or <lb/>
            other, should know all, or the most part of that which is in <lb/>
            question; as, whosoever is to advise the Athenians in the <lb/>
            question, whether they are to make War or no, must know <lb/>
            what their Revenues be; what, and what kind of power they <lb/>
            have: and he that will praise them, must know their acts at <lb/>
            Salamis, Marathon, etc. It will be necessary for a good <lb/>
            speaker to have in readiness the choicest particulars of what­ <lb/>
            soever he foresees he may speak of.</p>
          <p>He that is to speak ex tempore, must comprehend in his <lb/>
            speech as much as he can of what is most proper in the mat­ <lb/>
            ter in hand.</p>
          <p>Proper, I call those things which are least common to others; <lb/>
            as, he that will praise Achilles, is not to declare such things <lb/>
            as are common both to him, and Diomedes; as that he was a <lb/>
            Prince, and warred against the Trojans; but such things as <lb/>
            are proper only to Achilles; as that he killed Hector and <lb/>
            Cygnus; went to the War young, and voluntary.</p>
          <p>Let this therefore be one general Place, from that which is <lb/>

            or such as bring a man to some impossibility; we will first <lb/>
            set down the Places of Enthymemes Ostensive.</p>
          <p>An Ostensive Enthymeme is, wherein a man concludes the <lb/>
            question from somewhat granted.</p>
          <p>That Enthymeme which brings a Man to an impossibility, <lb/>
            is an Enthymeme wherein from that which the Adversary <lb/>
            maintaineth, we conclude that which is manifestly impossible.</p>
          <p>All Places have been already set down in a manner in the <lb/>
            precedent Propositions of Good, Evil, Just, Unjust, Honour­ <lb/>
            able, and Dishonourable: namely, they have been set down as <lb/>
            applyed to Particular Subjects, or in Concrete.</p>
          <p>Here they are to be set down in another manner; namely <lb/>
            in the Abstract or Universal.</p>
          <p>The first Place then let be from Contraries, which in the <lb/>
            Concrete or Particulars is exemplified thus. If Intemperance <lb/>
            be hurtful, Temperance is profitable: and if Intemperance be <lb/>
            not hurtful, neither is Temperance profitable.</p>
          <p>Another Place may be from Cognomination or affinity of <lb/>
            words: as in this Particular. If what is Just be Good; <lb/>
            then what is justly is well: but justly to die is not well: there­ <lb/>
            fore not all that is Just is Good.</p>
          <p>A third from Relatives; as, This Man has justly done, <lb/>
            therefore the other has justly suffered. But this Place some­ <lb/>
            times deceives, for a man may suffer justly, yet not from him.</p>
          <p>A fourth from Comparison, three ways.</p>
          <p>From the Great to the Less: as, He has stricken his Father; <lb/>
            and therefore this Man.</p>
          <p>From the Less to the Greater: as, The Gods know not all <lb/>
            things; much less Man.</p>
          <p>From Equality: as, If Captains be not always the worse <lb/>
            esteemed for losing a Victory; why should Sophisters?</p>
          <p>Another from the Time: as Philip to the Thebans: If I <lb/>
            had required to pass through your Country with my Army, <lb/>
            before I had ayded you against the Phocæans, there is no <pb n="323"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XXIV.] </note> <lb/>
            doubt but you would have promised it me. It is absurd there­ <lb/>
            fore to deny it me now, after I have trusted you.</p>
          <p>A sixth from what the Adversary says of himself: as, <lb/>
            Iphicrates asked Aristophon, whether he would take a Bribe <lb/>
            to betray the Army; and he answering no; What (say he) <lb/>
            is it likely that Iphicrates would betray the Army; and Aris­ <lb/>
            tophon not?</p>
          <p>This Place would be ridiculous, where the Defendant were <lb/>
            not in much more estimation than the Accuser.</p>
          <p>A seventh from the Definition; as that of Socrates; a Spi­ <lb/>
            rit is either God, or the Creature of God: and therefore <lb/>
            he denies not Chat there is a God, that confesses there are <lb/>
            Spirits.</p>
          <p>An eighth from the distinction of an ambiguous word.</p>
          <p>A ninth from Division : as, If all Men do what they do for <lb/>
            one of three causes, whereof two are impossible; and the Ac­ <lb/>
            cuser charge not the Defendant with the third; it follows that <lb/>
            he has not done it.</p>
          <p>A tenth from Induction : as, At Athens, at Thebes, at <lb/>
            Sparta, etc. And therefore every where.</p>
          <p>An eleventh from Authority, or precedent sentence ; as that <lb/>
            of Sappho, that Death is evil, for that the Gods have judged it <lb/>
            so, in exempting themselves from mortality.</p>
          <p>A twelfth from the Consequence: as, <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Τι</foreign>s not good to be <lb/>
            envied; therefore neither to be learned. ' Tis good to be wise, <lb/>
            therefore also to be instructed.</p>
          <p>A thirteenth from two contrary Consequences ; as,' Tis not <lb/>
            good to be an Orator, because if he speak the truth, he shall <lb/>
            displease Men: If he speak falsely, he shall displease God.</p>
          <p>Here is to be noted, that sometimes this argument may be <lb/>
            retorted : as thus, If you speak truth, you shall please God; if <lb/>
            you speak untruth, you shall please men: therefore by all <lb/>
            means be an Orator.</p>
          <p>A Fourteenth from the quality that Men have to praise one <lb/>
            thing, and approve another: as, We ought not to war against <lb/>
            the Athenians upon no precedent injury ; for all Men discom­ <lb/>
            mend injustice. Again, We ought to war against the Athenians; <lb/>
            for otherwise our Liberty is at their mercy, that is, is no Liberty; <lb/>
            but the preservation of Liberty is a thing that all Men will <lb/>
            approve.</p>
          <p>A Fifteenth from Proportion: as, seeing we naturalize <note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note> <pb n="324"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            strangers for their vertues, why should we not banish this <lb/>
            stranger for his vices ?</p>
          <p>A Sixteenth from the similitude of Consequents: as, He that <lb/>
            denies the immortality of the Gods, is no worse than he that has <lb/>
            written the generation of the Gods. For the same Consequence <lb/>
            follows of both, that sometimes there are none.</p>
          <p>A Seventeenth from that, that Men change their mind: as, <lb/>
            If when we were in Banishment, we fought to recover our <lb/>
            Country, why should we not fight now to retain it ?</p>
          <p>An Eighteenth from a fained end: as, that Diomedes chose <lb/>
            Ulysses to go with him, not as more valiant than another; but <lb/>
            as one that would partake less of the Glory.</p>
          <p>A Nineteenth from the Cause; as if he would infer he did <lb/>
            it from this, that he had Cause to do it.</p>
          <p>A Twentieth from that which is Incredible, but True: as, <lb/>
            that Laws may need a Law to mend them; as well as Fish <lb/>
            bred in the salt Water, may need salting.</p>

            <title type="sub">Of the Places of Enthymemes that lead to Impossibility.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>LET the first Place be from inspection of Times, Actions, or <lb/>
            Words, either of the Adversary, or of the Speaker, or both. <lb/>
            Of the Adversary; as, He says, he loves the People, and yet <lb/>
            he was in the Conspiracy of the Thirty. Of the Speaker; as, <lb/>
            He says, I am contentious, and yet I never began Suit. Of <lb/>
            both ; as, He never conferred any thing to the benefit of the <lb/>
            Commonwealth, whereas I have ransomed divers Citizens with <lb/>
            mine own Money.</p>
          <p>A Second, from shewing the cause of that which seemed <lb/>
            amiss, and serves for Men of good reputation that are ac­ <lb/>
            cused ; as, The Mother that was accused of Incest for being <lb/>
            seen embracing her Son, was absolved as soon as she made <lb/>
            appear, that she embraced him upon his arrival from far, by <lb/>
            way of Salutation.</p>
          <p>A Third, from rend ring of the cause; as, Leodamas, to <lb/>
            whom it was objected, that he had, under the Thirty Tyrants, <lb/>
            defaced the Inscription (which the People had set up in a <lb/>
            Pillar) of his Ignominy; answered, He had not done it; be­ <lb/>
            cause it would have been more to his commodity to let it stand ; <pb n="325"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            thereby to indear himself to. the Tyrants, by the Testimony of <lb/>
            the Peoples hatred.</p>
          <p>A Fourth, from better Counsel; as, He might have done <lb/>
            better for himself; therefore he did not this. But this Place <lb/>
            deceives, when the better Counsel comes to mind after the <lb/>
            Fact.</p>
          <p>A Fifth, from Incompatibility of the things to be done; as, <lb/>
            They that did deliberate whether they should both mourn and <lb/>
            sacrifice at the Funeral of Leucothea, were told, that if they <lb/>
            thought her a Goddess, they ought not to Mourn; and if they <lb/>
            thought her a Mortal, they ought not to Sacrifice,</p>
          <p>A Sixth, (which is proper to Judicial Orations,) from an <lb/>
            Inference of Errour; as, If he did it not, he was not wise, <lb/>
            therefore he did it1.</p>
          <p>Enthymemes that lead to Impossibility, please more than <lb/>
            Ostensive: for they compare, and put contraries together, <lb/>
            whereby they are the better set off, and more conspicuous to <lb/>
            the Auditor.</p>
          <p>Of all Enthymemes, they be best, which we assent to as <lb/>
            soon as hear. For such consent pleaseth us; and makes us <lb/>
            favourable to the Speaker.</p>

          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Of the Places of seeming Enthymemes.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>OF seeming Enthymemes, one Place may be from the Form of <lb/>
            speaking; as when a Man has repeated divers Sentences, he <lb/>
            brings in his Conclusion, as if it followed necessarily, though <lb/>
            it do not.</p>
          <p>A Second from an ambiguous word.</p>
          <p>A Third from that which is true divided, to that which is <lb/>
            false joyned; as that of Orestes, It was justice that I should <lb/>
            revenge my Fathers death, and it was justice my Mother should <lb/>
            die for killing my Father, therefore I justly killed my Mother. <lb/>
            Or from that which is true joyned, to that which is false <note type="footnote"> I Aristotle mentions a seventh element, derivable from puns upon <lb/>
            words. This however our analyst entirely overlooks; from the con­ <lb/>
            sideration probably that it could contribute but little to the argumentative <lb/>
            strength of an oration; or because it may be applied no less to confirma­ <lb/>
            tion than to refutation. </note> <pb n="326"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            divided; as, one cup of Wine, and one cup of Wine, are <lb/>
            hurtful; therefore'one cup of Wine is hurtful.</p>
          <p>A Fourth from Amplification of the Crime. For neither is <lb/>
            the Defendant likely to have committed the Crime he ampli­ <lb/>
            fies; nor does the Accuser seem, when he is passionate, to <lb/>
            want ground for his Accusation.</p>
          <p>A Fifth from signs; as. when a Man concludes the doing of <lb/>
            the Fact from the manner of his life.</p>
          <p>A Sixth from that which comes by chance, as if from this, <lb/>
            that the Tyranny of Hipparchus came to be overthrown from <lb/>
            the love of Aristogeiton to Harmodius, a Man should conclude, <lb/>
            that in a free Common-wealth loving of Boys were profitable.</p>
          <p>A Seventh from the Consequence, as Banishment is to be <lb/>
            desired, because a banished Man has choice of places to dwell in.</p>
          <p>An Eighth from making that the cause which is not; as, In <lb/>
            Demosthenes his Government, the War began; therefore De­ <lb/>
            mosthenes governed well. With the Pelponnesian War be­ <lb/>
            gan the Plague, therefore Pericles that perswaded that War, <lb/>
            did ill.</p>
          <p>A Ninth from the Omission of some circumstance, as, <lb/>
            Helen did what was lawful, when sAe ran away with Paris, <lb/>
            because sAe had her Father's consent to choose her own Hus­ <lb/>
            band; which was true only during the time that she had not <lb/>
            chosen.</p>
          <p>A Tenth, from that which is probable in some case, to that <lb/>
            which is probable simply; as, <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Τι</foreign>s probable, he foresaw, that if <lb/>
            he did it, he should be suspected; therefore His probable he did <lb/>
            it not.</p>
          <p>From this Place one may infer both ways that he did it not. <lb/>
            For if he be not likely to do it, it may be thought he did it not, <lb/>
            again, if he were likely to do it, it may be thought he did it not, <lb/>
            for this, that he knew he should be suspected.</p>
          <p>Upon this Place was grounded the Art, which was so much <lb/>
            detested in Protagoras, of making the better cause seem the <lb/>
            worse; and the worse the better.</p><pb n="327"/>

          </ab>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Of the Wage, to answer the Arguments of the Adversary.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AN Argument is answered by an opposite Syllogisme, or by an <lb/>
            Objection.</p>
          <p>The Places of opposite Syllogismes are the same with the <lb/>
            Places of Syllogismes, or Enthymemes: for a Rhetorical Syl­ <lb/>
            logisme is an Enthymeme.</p>
          <p>The Places of Objections are four.</p>
          <p>First, from the same, as, To the Adversary that proves <lb/>
            love to be good by an Enthymeme, may be objected, that no <lb/>
            want is good, and yet Love is want; or particularly thus: The <lb/>
            Love of Myrrha to her Father was not good.</p>
          <p>The Second from Contraries: as, if the Adversary say, A <lb/>
            good Man does good to his friends, an Objection might be <lb/>
            made, that then an evil Man will do also evil to his friends.</p>
          <p>The Third from Similitude: as thus, if the Adversary say, <lb/>
            all Men that are injured, do hate those that have injured them, <lb/>
            it may be objected, that then, all Men that had received Bene­ <lb/>
            fits should love their Benefactors, that is to say, be grateful.</p>
          <p>The Fourth from the authority of famous men; as when a <lb/>
            Man shall say, that drunken Men ought to be pardoned those <lb/>
            Acts they do in their drunkenness, because they know not <lb/>
            what they do; the Objection may be, that Pittacus was of an­ <lb/>
            other mind, that appointed for such Acts a double punishment; <lb/>
            one for the Act, another for the Drunkenness.</p>
          <p>And forasmuch as all Enthymemes are drawn from Proba­ <lb/>
            bility, or Example, or from a Sign Fallible, or from a Sign <lb/>
            Infallible: an Enthymeme from Probability may be confuted <lb/>
            really, by shewing that for the most part it falls out other­ <lb/>
            wise ; but apparently or sophistically, by shewing only that it <lb/>
            does not fall out so alwayes; whereupon the Judge thinks the <lb/>
            Probability not sufficient to ground his Sentence upon.</p>
          <p>[The Reason whereof is this, That the Judge, while he <lb/>
            hears the Fact proved probable, conceives it as true. For <lb/>
            the Understanding has no Object but Truth. And <lb/>
            therefore by and by, when he shall hear an Instance to <lb/>
            the contrary; and thereby find that he had no necessity <lb/>
            to think it true, presently changes his opinion, and thinks <lb/>
            it false, and consequently not so much as probable. For <pb n="328"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            he cannot at one time think the same thing both probable <lb/>
            and false: and he that says a thing is probable, the <lb/>
            meaning is, he thinks it true, but finds not arguments <lb/>
            enough to prove it.]</p>
          <p>An Enthymeme from a fallible sign, is answered, by shew­ <lb/>
            ing the sign to be fallible.</p>
          <p>An Enthymeme from an Example, is answered, as an En­ <lb/>
            thymeme from Probability; really, by shewing more Exam­ <lb/>
            ples to the contrary; apparently, if he bring Examples <lb/>
            enough to make it seem not necessary.</p>
          <p>If the Adversary have more Examples than we, we must <lb/>
            make appear that they are not applycable to the Case.</p>
          <p>An Enthymeme from an infallible sign, if the Proposition <lb/>
            be true, is unanswerable.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAP. XXVIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Amplification and Extenuation are not Common Places. Enthymemes <lb/>
            by which Arguments are answered, are the same with those by <lb/>
            which the Matter in question is proved, or disproved. Objections <lb/>
            are not Enthymeme8.</p>
          <p>THE first, that Amplification and Extenuation are not Com­ <lb/>
            mon Places, appears by this, that Amplification and Extenu­ <lb/>
            ation do prove a fact to be great, or little; and are therefore <lb/>
            Enthymemes, to be drawn from Common Places, and therefore <lb/>
            are not the Places themselves.</p>
          <p>The second, that Enthymemes, by which Arguments are <lb/>
            answered, are of the same kind with those by which the mat­ <lb/>
            ter in question is proved, is manifest by this, that these infer <lb/>
            the opposite of what was proved by the other.</p>
          <p>The third, that an Objection is no Enthymeme, is apparent <lb/>
            by this, that an Objection is no more but an Opinion, Exam­ <lb/>
            ple, or other Instance, produced to make appear, that the Ad­ <lb/>
            versaries Argument does not conclude.</p>
          <p>Thus much of Examples, Sentences, Enthymemes, and ge­ <lb/>
            nerally of all things that belong to Argumentation; from what <lb/>
            Places they may be drawn, or answered.</p>
          <p>There remains Elocution and Disposition to be spoken of <lb/>
            in the next Book.</p>

          <p>As for Action, or Pronuntiation, so much as is necessary <lb/>
            for an Orator, may be fetcht out of the Book of the Art of <lb/>
            Poetry, in which we have treated of the Action of the Stage.</p>
          <p>For Tragedians were the first that invented such Action, <lb/>
            and that but of late ; and it consisteth in governing well the <lb/>
            magnitude, tone, and measure of the Voice; a thing less sub­ <lb/>
            ject to Art, than is either Proof, or Elocution.</p>
          <p>And yet there have been Rules delivered concerning it, as <lb/>
            far forth as serve for Poetry.</p>
          <p>But Oratorical Action has not been hitherto reduced to Art.</p>
          <p>And Orators in the beginning, when they saw that the <lb/>
            Poets in barren and feigned Arguments, nevertheless attained <lb/>
            great Reputation ; supposing it had proceeded from the choice, <lb/>
            or connexion of words, fell into a Stile, by imitation of them, <lb/>
            approaching to Verse, and made choice of words.</p>
          <p>But when the Poets changed their Stile, and laid by all <lb/>
            words that were not in common use, the Orators did the same, <lb/>
            and lighted at last upon words, and a Government of the <lb/>
            Voice and Measures proper to themselves.</p>
          <p>Seeing therefore Pronuntiation, or Action are in some de­ <lb/>
            gree necessary also for an Orator, the Precepts thereof are <lb/>
            to be fetcht from the Art of Poetry.</p>
          <p>[In the mean time this may be one general rule. If the <lb/>
            Words, Tone, Greatness of the Voice, Gesture of the <lb/>
            Body and Countenance, seem to proceed all from one <lb/>
            Passion, then 'tis well pronounced. Otherwise not. <pb n="330"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            For when there appear more passions than one at once, <lb/>
            the mind of the Speaker appears unnatural and dis­ <lb/>
            tracted. Otherwise, as the mind of the Speaker, so the <lb/>

            <title type="sub">Of the Choice of Words and Epithets.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Vertues of a Word are two ; the first, that it be perspicu­ <lb/>
            ous; the second, that it be decent; that is, neither above, nor <lb/>
            below the thing signified ; or, neither too humble, nor too fine.</p>
          <p>Perspicuous are all Words that be Proper.</p>
          <p>Fine Words are those, that are borrowed, or Translated <lb/>
            from other significations; of which in the Art of Poetry.</p>
          <p>The reason why borrowed Words please, is this. Men are <lb/>
            affected with Words, as they are with Men, admiring in both <lb/>
            that which is Forraign and New.</p>
          <p>To make a Poem graceful, many things help; but few an <lb/>
            Oration.</p>
          <p>For to a Poet it sufficeth with what Words he can set out <lb/>
            his Poem: but an Orator must not only do that; but also <lb/>
            seem not to do it: for else he will be thought to speak un­ <lb/>
            naturally, and not as he thinks ; and thereby be the less <lb/>
            believed; whereas belief is the scope of his Oration.</p>
          <p>The Words that an Orator ought to use are of three sorts. <lb/>
            Proper ; such as are Received; and Metaphors.</p>
          <p>Words taken from Forraign Languages, Words compounded, <lb/>
            and Words new coyned, are seldom to be used.</p>
          <p>Synonimaes belong to Poets, and Equivocal Words to <lb/>
            Sophisters.</p>
          <p>An Orator, if he use Proper Words, and Received, and <lb/>
            good Metaphors, shall both make his Oration beautiful, and <lb/>
            not seem to intend it; and shall speak perspicuously. For in <lb/>
            a Metaphor alone there is Perspicuity, Novity, and Sweetness.</p>
          <p>Concerning Metaphors the Rules are these. <lb/>
            1. He that will make the best of a thing, let him draw his <lb/>
            Metaphor from somewhat that is better. As for Example, <lb/>
            let him call a Crime, an Error. On the other side, when he <lb/>
            would make the worst of it, let him draw his Metaphor from <lb/>
            somewhat worse, as, calling Error, Crime.</p><pb n="331"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CHAP. III.] </note> 2. A Metaphor ought not to be so far fetcht, as that the <lb/>
            Similitude may not easily appear.</p>
          <p>3. A Metaphor ought to be drawn from the noblest things, <lb/>
            as the Poets do that choose rather to say, Rosy-fingered, <lb/>
            than Red-fingered Aurora.</p>
          <p>In like manner the Rule of Epithets is, <lb/>
            That he that will adorn, should use those of the better sort; <lb/>
            and he that will disgrace, should use those of the worse: as <lb/>
            Simonides being to Write an Ode in honour of the Victory <lb/>
            gotten in a Course by certain Mules, being not well paid, called <lb/>
            them by their name [<foreign xml:lang="grc">῾Ημιόνους</foreign>] that signifies their propinquity <lb/>
            to Asses: but having received a greater reward, stiles them <lb/>
            the Sons of swift-footed Coursers.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE things that make an Oration flat or insipide, are four.</p>
          <p>1. Words Compounded; [and yet a Man may Compound <lb/>
            a word, when the Composition is necessary, for want of a <lb/>
            simple word; and easie, and seldom used.]</p>
          <p>2. Forraign Words. As for Example, such as are newly <lb/>
            derived from the Latine; which though they were proper <lb/>
            among them whose tongue it is, are Forraign in another Lan­ <lb/>
            guage : and yet these may be used, so it be moderately.</p>
          <p>3. Long, impertinent, and often Epithets.</p>
          <p>4. Metaphors, indecent, and obscure. Obscure they are, <lb/>
            when they are far fetcht. Indecent when they are ridiculous, <lb/>
            as in Comedies ; or too grave, as in Tragedies.</p>

            <title type="sub">Of a Similitude.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A SIMILITUDE differs from a Metaphor only by such Par­ <lb/>
            ticks of Comparison as these, As; Even as ; So; Even so, etc.</p>
          <p>A Similitude therefore is a Metaphor dilated; and a Meta­ <lb/>
            phor is a Similitude Contracted into one Word.</p>
          <p>A Similitude does well in an Oration, so it be not too fre­ <lb/>
            quent ; for 'tis Poetical.</p><pb n="332"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> An Example of a Similitude, is this of Pericles; that said <lb/>
            in his Oration, that the Bæotians were like to so many Oaks <lb/>

            <title type="sub">Of the Purity of Language.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>FOUR things are necessary to make Language Pure.</p>
          <p>1. The right rendring of those Particles which some ante­ <lb/>
            cedent Particle does require: as to a Not only, a Not also ; <lb/>
            and then they are rendered right, when they are not sus­ <lb/>
            pended too long.</p>
          <p>2. The use of proper Words, rather than Circumlocutions, <lb/>
            unless there be motive to make one do it of purpose.</p>
          <p>3. That there be nothing of double construction, unless <lb/>
            there be cause to do it of purpose. As the Prophets (of the <lb/>
            Heathen) who speak in general terms, to the end they may <lb/>
            the better maintain the truth of their Prophesies ; which is <lb/>
            easier maintained in generals, than in particulars. For 'tis <lb/>
            easier to divine, whether a number be even or odd, than how <lb/>
            many; and that a thing will be, than what it will be.</p>
          <p>4. Concordance of Gender, Number, and Person; as not to <lb/>
            say Him for Her; Man for Men ; Hath for Have.</p>
          <p>In Summ; a Man's Language ought to be easie for another <lb/>
            to read, pronounce, and point.</p>
          <p>Besides, to divers Antecedents, let divers Relatives, or one <lb/>
            common to them all, be correspondent: as, He saw the <lb/>
            Colour; He heard the Sound; or He perceived both Colour <lb/>
            and Sound; but by no means, He heard or saw both.</p>
          <p>Lastly, that which is to be interposed by Parenthesis, let it <lb/>
            be done quickly: as, I purposed, having spoken to him (to this, <lb/>
            and this purpose) afterward to be gone. For to put it off <lb/>
            thus: I resolved, after I had spoken to him, to be gone ; but <lb/>
            the subject of my speech was to this and this purpose, is vitious.</p>

          <p>1. By speaking feelingly; that is, with such Passion as is <lb/>
            fit for the matter he is in; as Angerly in matter of Injury.</p>
          <p>2. By speaking as becomes the Person of the Speaker; as <lb/>
            for a Gentleman to speak eruditely.</p>
          <p>3. By speaking proportionably to the matter ; as of great <lb/>
            affairs to speak in a high ; and of mean, in a low Stile.</p>
          <p>4. By abstaining from Compounded, and from Outlandish <lb/>
            words; unless a Man speak passionately, and have already <lb/>
            moved, and, as it were, inebriated his Hearers. Or Ironically.</p>
          <p>It confers also to perswasion very much, to use these ordin­ <lb/>
            ary Forms of speaking, All men know; <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Τι</foreign>s confessed by all; <lb/>
            No Man will deny, and the like. For the Hearer consents, <lb/>
            surprized with the fear to be esteemed the only Ignorant Man.</p>
          <p>'Tis good also, having used a word that signifies more than <lb/>
            the matter requires, to abstain from the Pronunciation and <lb/>
            Countenance that to such a word belongs: that the Dispro­ <lb/>
            portion between it and the matter may the less appear. And <lb/>
            when a Man has said too much, it will shew well to correct <lb/>
            himself: for he will get belief by seeming to consider what <lb/>
            he says.</p>
          <p>[But in this a Man must have a care not to be too precise <lb/>
            in shewing of this Consideration. For the ostentation of <lb/>
            Carefulness is an argument oftentimes of lying; as may be <lb/>
            observed in such as tell particularities not easily observed, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THERE be two sorts of Stiles.</p>
          <p>The one continued or to be comprehended at once; the <lb/>
            other divided, or distinguished by Periods.</p>
          <p>The first sort was in use with antient Writers: but is now <lb/>
            out of date.</p>
          <p>An Example of this Stile is in the History of Herodotus; <lb/>
            wherein there is no Period till the end of the whole History.</p>
          <p>In the other kind of Stile, that is distinguished by Periods ; <lb/>
            a Period is such a part as is perfect in it self, and has such <lb/>
            length as may easily be comprehended by the understanding.</p>
          <p>This later kind is pleasant; the former unpleasant, because <lb/>
            this appears finite, the other infinite: in this the Hearer has <lb/>
            always somewhat set out, and terminated to him; in the other <lb/>
            he fore-sees no end, and has nothing finished to him; this <lb/>
            may easily be committed to memory, because of the measure <lb/>
            and cadence (which is the cause that Verses be easily remem­ <lb/>
            bered) ; the other not.</p>
          <p>Every Sentence ought to end with the period, and nothing <lb/>
            to be interposed.</p>
          <p>Period is either simple, or divided into Parts.</p>
          <p>Simple is that which is Indivisible; as, I wonder you fear <lb/>
            not their ends, whose actions you imitate.</p>
          <p>A Period divided, is that which not only has perfection and <lb/>
            length convenient, for respiration, but also Parts. As, I won­ <lb/>
            der you are not afraid of their ends, seeing you imitate their <lb/>
            actions: where in these words, I wonder you are not afraid <lb/>
            of their ends, is one Colon, or Part; and in these, Seeing you <lb/>
            imitate their actions, another: and both together make the <lb/>
            Period.</p>
          <p>The parts, or members, and periods of speech ought neither <lb/>
            to be too long, nor too short.</p>
          <p>Too long are they, which are produced beyond the expect­ <lb/>
            ation of the Hearer.</p>
          <p>Too short are they, that end before he expects it. <note type="footnote"> 1 Hobbes has overlooked Aristotle's 8th chapter " on Rhythm." </note></p><pb n="335"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CHAP. IX.] </note> Those that be too long, leave the Hearer behind, like him <lb/>
            that walking, goes beyond the usual end of the Walk, and <lb/>
            thereby out-goes him that walks with him.</p>
          <p>They that be too short, make the Hearer stumble; for <lb/>
            when he looks far before him, the end stops him before he be <lb/>
            aware.</p>
          <p>A period that is divided into parts, is either divided only; <lb/>
            or has also an Opposition of the Parts one to another.</p>
          <p>Divided only is such as this: This the Senate knows; the <lb/>
            Consul sees; and yet the Man lives.</p>
          <p>A Period with Opposition of Parts, called also Antithesis, <lb/>
            and the parts Antitheta, is when contrary parts are put toge­ <lb/>
            ther ; or also joyned by a third.</p>
          <p>Contrary parts are put together, as here, The one has ob­ <lb/>
            tained Glory, the other Riches; both by my benefit.</p>
          <p>Antitheta are therefore acceptable; because not only the <lb/>
            parts appear the better for the opposition; but also for that <lb/>
            they carry with them a certain appearance of that kind of En­ <lb/>
            thymeme, which leads to Impossibility.</p>
          <p>Parts, or Members of a Period, are said to be equal, when <lb/>
            they have altogether, or almost equal Number of Syllables.</p>
          <p>Parts, or Members of a Period, are said to be like, when <lb/>
            they begin, or end alike: and the more Similitudes, and the <lb/>
            greater equality there is of Syllables, the more graceful is the <lb/>
            Period.</p>

          <p>FORASMUCH as there is nothing more delightful to a Man, <lb/>
            than to find that he apprehends and learns easily ; it neces­ <lb/>
            sarily follows, that those Words are most grateful to the Ear, <lb/>
            that make a Man seem to see before his Eyes the things sig­ <lb/>
            nified.</p>
          <p>And therefore Forraign Words are unpleasant, because <lb/>
            Obscure; and Plain Words, because too Manifest, making us <lb/>
            learn nothing new: but Metaphors please; for they beget in <lb/>
            us by the Genus, or some common thing to that with another, <lb/>
            a kind of Science: as when an Old Man is called Stubble; <lb/>

            withers like Grass, being put in mind of it by the qualities <lb/>
            common to Stubble, and to Old Men.</p>
          <p>That which a Metaphor does, a Similitude does the same; <lb/>
            but with less grace, because with more prolixity.</p>
          <p>Such Enthymemes are the most graceful, which neither are <lb/>
            presently very Manifest, nor yet very hard to be understood 1, <lb/>

            the General to the Particular. 2. From the Particular <lb/>
            to the General. 3. From one Particular to another. <lb/>
            4. From Proportion.</p>
          <p>A Metaphor from Proportion is such as this, A State with­ <lb/>
            out Youth, is a Year without a Spring.</p>
          <p>Animation is that expression which makes us seem to see <lb/>
            the thing before our eyes; as he that said, The Athenians <lb/>
            poured out their City into Sicily, meaning, they sent thither <lb/>
            the greatest Army they could make; and this is the greatest <lb/>
            grace of an Oration.</p>
          <p>If therefore in the same Sentence there concur both Meta­ <lb/>
            phor, and this Animation, and also Antithesis, it cannot choose <lb/>
            but be very graceful.</p>
          <p>That an Oration is graced by Metaphor, Animation, and <lb/>
            Antithesis, hath been said: but how 'tis graced, is to be said <lb/>
            in the next Chapter.</p>

          <p>Such Metaphors as these come into a Mans mind by the <lb/>
            observation of things that have similitude and proportion one <lb/>
            to another. And the more unlike and unproportionable the <lb/>
            things be otherwise, the more grace bath the Metaphor.</p>
          <p>A Metaphor without Animation, adds grace then, when the <lb/>
            Hearer finds he learns somewhat by such use of the word.</p>
          <p>Also Paradoxes are graceful, so Men inwardly do believe <lb/>
            them: for they have in them somewhat like to those jests that <lb/>
            are grounded upon the similitude of words, which have usually <lb/>
            one sense, and in the present another; and somewhat like to <lb/>
            those jests which are grounded upon the deceiving of a Mans <lb/>
            expectation.</p>
          <p>And Paragrams; that is, allusions of words are graceful, <lb/>
            if they be well placed; and in Periods not too long ; and with <lb/>
            Antithesis; for by these means the ambiguity is taken away.</p>
          <p>And the more of these; namely, Metaphor, Animation, <lb/>
            Antithesis, Equality of Members, a Period hath, the more <lb/>
            graceful it is.</p>
          <p>Similitudes grace an Oration, when they contain also a <lb/>
            Metaphor.</p>
          <p>And Proverbs are graceful, because they are Metaphors, or <lb/>
            Translations of words from one species to another.</p>
          <p>And Hyperboles, because they also are Metaphors: but <lb/>
            they are youthful, and bewray vehemence; and are used with <lb/>
            most grace by them that are angry; and for that cause are <lb/>
            not comely in Old Men.</p>

          <p>THE Stile that should be Read ought to be more exact and <lb/>
            accurate.</p>
          <p>But the Stile of a Pleader ought to be suited to Action and <lb/>
            Pronuntiation.</p>
          <p>Orations of them that Plead, pass away with the hearing.</p>
          <p>But those that are Written, Men carry about them, and are <lb/>
            considered at leisure; and consequently must endure to be <lb/>
            sifted and examined.</p>
          <p>Written Orations appear flat in Pleading. <note type="footnote"> z </note></p><pb n="338"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> And Orations made for the Barr, when the Action is away, <lb/>
            appear in Reading insipide.</p>
          <p>In Written Orations Repetition is justly condemned.</p>
          <p>But in Pleadings, by the help of Action, and by some <lb/>
            change in the Pleader, Repetition becomes Amplification.</p>
          <p>In Written Orations Disjunctives do ill; as, I came, If found <lb/>
            Aim, I asked him: for they seem superfluous, and but one <lb/>
            thing, because they are not distinguished by Action.</p>
          <p>But in Pleadings 'tis Amplification; because that which is <lb/>
            but one thing, is made to seem many.</p>
          <p>Of Pleadings, that which is Judicial ought to be more ac­ <lb/>
            curate, than that which is before the people.</p>
          <p>And an Oration to the people ought to be more accommodate <lb/>
            to Action, than a Judicial.</p>
          <p>And of Judicial Orations, that ought to be more accurate, <lb/>
            which is uttered to few Judges ; and that ought to be more <lb/>
            accommodate to Action, which is uttered to many. As in a <lb/>
            Picture, the farther he stands off that beholds it, the less need <lb/>
            there is that the Colours be fine: so in Orations, the farther <lb/>
            the Hearer stands off, the less need there is for his Oration to <lb/>
            be elegant.</p>
          <p>Therefore Demonstrative Orations are most proper for <lb/>
            Writing, the end whereof is to Read.</p>

          <p>THE necessary Parts of an Oration are but two; Proposi­ <lb/>

            Demonstration.</p>
          <p>The Proposition is the explication, or opening of the Mat­ <lb/>

          <p>And Proof is the Demonstration of the Matter propounded.</p>
          <p>To these necessary parts, are sometimes added two other, <lb/>

          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Of the Proeme.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Proeme is the beginning of an Oration, and, as it were, <lb/>
            the preparing of the way before one enter into it.</p>
          <p>In some kinds of Orations it resembles the Prelude of Mu­ <lb/>
            sicians, who first play what they list, and afterwards the Tune <lb/>
            they intended.</p>
          <p>In other kinds it resembles the Prologue of a Play, that <lb/>
            contains the Argument.</p>
          <p>Proemes of the first sort, are most proper for Demonstrative <lb/>
            Orations; in which a Man is free to foretell, or not, what <lb/>
            points he will insist upon; and for the most part 'tis better <lb/>
            not: because when a Man has not obliged himself to a certain <lb/>
            matter, Digression will seem Variety: but if he have in gaged <lb/>
            himself, Variety will be accounted Digression.</p>
          <p>In Demonstratives the matter of the Proeme consisteth in <lb/>
            the Praise or Dispraise of some Law or Custom, or in Ex­ <lb/>
            hortation, or Dehortation ; or something that serves to incline <lb/>
            the Hearer to the purpose.</p>
          <p>Proemes of the second kind are most proper for Judicial <lb/>
            Orations. For as the Prologue in a Dramatick, and the Exor­ <lb/>
            dium in an Epique Poem, setteth first in few words the Argu­ <lb/>
            ment of the Poem: so in a Judicial Oration the Orator ought <lb/>
            to exhibit a Model of his Oration, that the mind of the Hearer <lb/>
            may not be suspended, and for want of fore-sight, err or wander.</p>
          <p>Whatsoever else belongs to a Proeme, is drawn from one <lb/>
            of these four; From the Speaker, From the Adversary, From <lb/>
            the Hearer, or from the Matter.</p>
          <p>From the Speaker and Adversary are drawn into Proemes <lb/>
            such Criminations and Purgations as belong not to the cause.</p>
          <p>To the Defendant 'tis necessary in the Proeme to answer to <lb/>
            the accusations of his Adversary; that those being cleared, he <lb/>
            may have a more favourable entrance to the rest of his Oration.</p>
          <p>But to the Plaintife 'tis better to cast his Criminations all <lb/>
            into the Epilogue, that the Judge may the more easily re­ <lb/>
            member them.</p>
          <p>From the Hearer and from the Matter are drawn into the <lb/>
            Proeme such things as serve to make the Hearer favourable, <lb/>
            or angry; attentive, or not attentive, as need shall require. <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note></p><pb n="340"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK in. </note> And Hearers use to be attentive to persons that are reputed <lb/>
            good; to things that are of great Consequence, or that concern <lb/>
            themselves, or that are strange, or that delight.</p>
          <p>But to make the Hearer attentive, is not the part of the <lb/>
            Proeme only, but of any other part of the Oration, and rather <lb/>
            of any other part, than of the Proeme. For the Hearer is <lb/>
            every where more remiss than in the beginning. And there­ <lb/>
            fore wheresoever there is need, the Orator must make appear <lb/>
            both the probity of his own person, and that the matter in <lb/>
            hand is of great Consequence; or that it concerns the Hearer; <lb/>
            or that it is new; or that it is delightful.</p>
          <p>He that will have the Hearer attentive to him, but not to <lb/>
            the Cause, must on the other side make it seem that the <lb/>
            matter is a trifle, without relation to the Hearer, common, <lb/>
            and tedious.</p>
          <p>That the Hearer may be favourable to the Speaker, one of <lb/>
            two things is required; that he love him, or that he pity him.</p>
          <p>In Demonstrative Orations, he that praises shall have the <lb/>
            Hearer favourable if he think himself, or his own manners, <lb/>
            or course of life, or any thing he loves, comprehended in the <lb/>
            same praise.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, he that dispraises, shall be heard favour­ <lb/>
            ably, if the Hearer find his Enemies, or their courses, or any <lb/>
            thing he hates, involved in the same dispraise.</p>
          <p>The Proeme of a Deliberative Oration is taken from the <lb/>
            same things, from which are taken the Proemes of Judicial <lb/>
            Orations. For the matter of a Deliberative Oration needeth <lb/>
            not that natural Proeme, by which is shewn what we are to <lb/>
            speak of; for that is already known: the Proeme in these, <lb/>
            being made only for the Speakers, or Adversaries sake; or to <lb/>
            make the Matter appear great, or little, as one would have it, <lb/>
            and is therefore to be taken from the persons of the Plaintif <lb/>
            or Defendant; or from the Hearer, or from the Matter, as in <lb/>
            Orations Judicial.</p>

          <p>7. From the Comprehension of those that are in Reputa­ <lb/>

            who nevertheless are good Men.</p>

          <p>10. From that the Judgment belongs to another Place, or <lb/>
            Time ; as, I have already answered, or am to answer else­ <lb/>
            where to this Matter.</p>
          <p>11. From Crimination of the Crimination; as, It serves only <lb/>
            to pervert Judgment.</p>
          <p>12. A twelfth, which is common both to Crimination and <lb/>
            Purgation, and is taken from some sign ; as Teucer is not to <lb/>
            be believed, because his Mother was Priam's Sister. On the <lb/>
            other side, Teucer is to be believed, because his Father was <lb/>
            Priam's Enemy.</p>
          <p>13. A thirteenth, proper to Crimination only, from praise <lb/>
            and dispraise mixt: as, To praise small things, and blame <lb/>
            great ones; or to praise in many words, and blame with ef­ <lb/>
            fectual ones; or to praise many things that are good, and then <lb/>
            add one evil, but a great one.</p>
          <p>14. A fourteenth, coming both to Crimination and Purga­ <lb/>
            tion, is taken from the interpretation of the fact: for he that <lb/>
            purgeth himself interpreteth the fact always in the best sense; <lb/>
            and he that Criminates, always in the worst; as when Ulysses <lb/>
            said, Diomedes chose him for his Companion, as the most able <lb/>
            of the Grecians, to aid him in his exploit: but his Adversary <lb/>

            <title type="sub">Of the Narration.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Narration is not always continued and of one Piece; <lb/>
            but sometimes, as in Demonstratives, interrupted, and dispers­ <lb/>
            ed through the whole Oration.</p>
          <p>For there being in a Narration something that falls not <lb/>
            under Art; as namely, the Actions themselves, which the <lb/>
            Orator inventeth not; he must therefore bring in the Nar­ <lb/>
            ration of them where he best may. As for Example, if being <lb/>
            to praise a Man, you would make a Narration of all his Acts <lb/>
            immediately from the beginning, and without interruption, <lb/>
            you will find it necessary afterwards to repeat the same Acts <lb/>
            again, while from some of them you praise his Valour, and <lb/>
            from others his Wisdom: whereby your Oration shall have <lb/>
            less variety, and shall less please.</p>
          <p>'Tis not necessary always that the Narration be short. <lb/>
            The true measure of it must be taken from the matter that is <lb/>
            to be laid open.</p>
          <p>In the Narration, as oft as may be, 'tis good to insert some­ <lb/>
            what commendable in ones self, and blameable in ones Adver­ <lb/>
            sary : As, I advised him but he would take no Counsel.</p>
          <p>In Narrations, a Man is to leave out whatsoever breeds <lb/>
            compassion, indignation in the Hearer besides the purpose; <lb/>
            as Ulysses in Homer, relating his Travels to Alcinous, to <lb/>
            move compassion in him, is so long in it, that it consists of <lb/>
            divers Books: but when he comes home, tells the same to his <lb/>
            Wife in thirty Verses, leaving out what might make her sad.</p>
          <p>The Narration ought also to be in such words as argue the <lb/>
            Manners; that is, some virtuous or vicious habit in him of <lb/>
            whom we speak, although it be not exprest; As, setting his <lb/>
            Arms a kenbold, he answered, etc. by which is insinuated the <lb/>
            pride of him that so answered.</p>
          <p>In an Oration a Man does better to shew his affection than <lb/>
            his Judgment: that is, 'Tis better to say, I like this; than to <lb/>
            say, This is better. For by the one you would seem wise, by <lb/>
            the other good. But Favour follows Goodness; whereas Wis­ <lb/>
            dom procures Envy.</p>
          <p>But if this Affection seem incredible, then either a reason <pb n="343"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            must be rendered, as did Antigone. For when she had said, <lb/>
            SAe loved her brother better than her Husband or Children ; <lb/>
            she added, for Husband and Children I may have more; <lb/>
            but another Brother I cannot, my Parents being both dead. <lb/>
            Or else a man must use this form of speaking; I know this <lb/>
            affection of mine seems strange to you; but nevertheless it is <lb/>
            such. For 'tis not easily believed, that any Man has a mind <lb/>
            to do any thing that is not for his own good.</p>
          <p>Besides in a Narration, not only the Actions themselves; <lb/>
            but the Passions, and signs that accompany them, are to be <lb/>
            discovered.</p>
          <p>And in his Narration a Man should make himself and his <lb/>

            covertly as he can.</p>
          <p>A Narration may have need sometimes not to be in the <lb/>
            beginning.</p>
          <p>In Deliberative Orations; that is, where soever the question <lb/>
            is of things to come ; a Narration, which is always of things <lb/>
            past, has no place: and yet things past may be recounted, that <lb/>
            Men may deliberate better of the future: But that is not as <lb/>
            Narration, but Proof; for 'tis Example.</p>
          <p>There may also be Narration in Deliberatives in that part <lb/>
            where Crimination and Praise come in: But that part is not <lb/>
            Deliberative, but Demonstrative.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>PROOFS are to be applyed to something controverted.</p>
          <p>The Controversie in Judicial Oration is, Whether it has <lb/>
            been done; whether it has been hurtful; whether the matter <lb/>
            be so great, and whether it be Just, or no.</p>
          <p>In a question of Fact, one of the Parties of necessity is <lb/>
            faulty, (for ignorance of the Fact is no excuse,) and therefore <lb/>
            the Fact is chiefly to be insisted on.</p>
          <p>In Demonstratives, the Fact for the most part is supposed: <lb/>
            but the honour and profit of the Fact are to be proved.</p>
          <p>In Deliberatives, the question is, Whether the thing be like <lb/>
            to be, or likely to be so great: or whether it be just; or whe­ <lb/>
            ther it be profitable.</p>
          <p>Besides the application of the Proof to the question, a Man <pb n="344"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            ought to observe, whether hi a Adversary have lyed in any <lb/>
            point without the Cause. For 'tis a sign-he does the same in <lb/>
            the Cause.</p>
          <p>The Proofs themselves are either Examples, or Enthymemes.</p>
          <p>A Deliberative Oration, because 'tis. of things to come, re­ <lb/>
            quireth rather Examples, than Enthymemes.</p>
          <p>But a Judicial Oration, being of things past, which have a <lb/>
            necessity in them, and may be concluded syllogistically, re­ <lb/>
            quireth rather Enthymemes.</p>
          <p>Enthymemes ought not to come too thick together, for they <lb/>
            hinder one anothers force by confounding the Hearer.</p>
          <p>Nor ought a Man to endeavour to prove every thing by <lb/>
            Enthymeme, least like some Philosophers, he collect what is <lb/>
            known, from what is less known.</p>
          <p>Nor ought a Man to use Enthymemes, when he would move <lb/>
            the Hearer to some affection: For seeing divers Motions do <lb/>
            mutually destroy or weaken one another, he will lose either <lb/>
            the Enthymeme, or the affection that he would move.</p>
          <p>For the same reason, a Man ought not to use Enthymemes <lb/>
            when he would express Manners.</p>
          <p>But whether he would move affection, or insinuate his <lb/>
            Manners, he may withal use Sentences.</p>
          <p>A Deliberative Oration is more difficult than a Judicial, <lb/>
            because 'tis of thefuture, whereas a Judicial is of that which <lb/>
            is past, and that consequently may be known; and because it <lb/>
            has principles, namely the Law; and it is easier to prove <lb/>
            from principles, than without.</p>
          <p>Besides, a Deliberative Oration wants those helps of turning <lb/>
            to the Adversary ; of speaking of himself; of raising passion.</p>
          <p>He therefore that wants matter in a Deliberative Oration, <lb/>
            let him bring in some person to praise or dispraise.</p>
          <p>And in Demonstratives he that has nothing to say in com­ <lb/>
            mendation or discommendation of the principal party, let him <lb/>
            praise or dispraise some body else, as his Father, or Kinsman, <lb/>
            or the very vertues or vices themselves.</p>
          <p>He that wants not Proofs, let him not only prove strongly, <lb/>
            but also insinuate his Manners: but he that has no Proof, let <lb/>
            him nevertheless insinuate his Manners. For a good Man <lb/>
            is as acceptable, as an exact Oration.</p>
          <p>Of Proofs, those that lead to an absurdity, please better <lb/>
            than those that are direct or ostensive ; because from the com- <pb n="345"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            parison of Contraries, namely, Truth and Falsity, the force <lb/>
            of the Syllogisme does the better appear.</p>
          <p>Confutation is also a part of Proof.</p>
          <p>And he that speaks first, puts it after his own Proofs, unless <lb/>
            the Controversie contain many and different matters. And <lb/>
            he that speaks last, puts it before.</p>
          <p>For 'tis necessary to make way for his own Oration, by <lb/>
            removing the Objections of him that spake before. For the <lb/>
            mind abhors both the Man, and his Oration, that is damned <lb/>
            before hand.</p>
          <p>If a Man desire his Manners should appear well, (least <lb/>
            speaking of himself he become odious, or troublesome, or <lb/>
            obnoxious to obtrectation; or speaking of another, he seem <lb/>
            contumelious, or scurrilous,) let him introduce another person.</p>
          <p>Last of all, least he cloy his Hearer with Enthymemes, let <lb/>
            him vary them sometimes with Sentences; but such as have <lb/>
            the same force. As here is an Enthymeme. If it be then the <lb/>
            best time to make peace when the best conditions of peace may <lb/>
            be had, then the time is now, while our Fortune is entire. And <lb/>
            this is a Sentence of equal force to it. Wise Men make peace, <lb/>
            while their Fortune is entire.</p>

          <p>THE times wherein 'tis fit to ask ones Adversary a question <lb/>
            are chiefly four.</p>
          <p>1. The first is, when of two Propositions that conclude <lb/>
            an Absurdity, he has already uttered one; and we would by <lb/>
            Interrogation draw him to confess the other.</p>
          <p>2. The second, when of two Propositions that conclude an <lb/>
            Absurdity, one is manifest of it self, and the other likely to <lb/>
            be fetched out by a question; then the Interrogation will be <lb/>
            seasonable; and the absurd Conclusion is presently to be in­ <lb/>
            ferred, without adding that Proposition which is manifest.</p>
          <p>3. The third, when a Man would make appear that his <lb/>
            Adversary does contradict himself.</p>
          <p>4. The fourth, when a Man would take from his Adversary <lb/>
            such shifts as these, In some sort 'tis so; In some sort 'tis <lb/>
            not so.</p><pb n="346"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> Out of these Cases 'tis not fit to interrogate. For he whose <lb/>
            question succeeds not, is thought vanquished.</p>
          <p>To equivocal questions a Man ought to answer fully, and <lb/>
            not to be too brief.</p>
          <p>To Interrogations which we fore-see tend to draw from us <lb/>
            an Answer, contrary to our purpose, we must, together with <lb/>
            our Answer, presently give an Answer to the objection which <lb/>
            is implyed in the Question.</p>
          <p>And where the Question exacteth an Answer that con­ <lb/>
            cludeth against us, we must together with our Answer pre­ <lb/>
            sently distinguish.</p>
          <p>Jests are dissolved by serious and grave discourse: and <lb/>
            grave discourse is deluded by Jests.</p>

          <p>Whereof one kind is Ironia, and tends to please ones self.</p>
          <p>The other is Scurrility, and tends to please others.</p>
          <p>The latter of these has in it a kind of baseness; the former <lb/>

            <title type="sub">Of the Peroration.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE Peroration must consist of one of these four things.</p>
          <p>Inclining the Judge to favour yourself, or to disfavour <lb/>
            your Adversary. For then, when all has been said respecting <lb/>
            the cause, is the best season to praise, or dispraise the Parties.</p>
          <p>Of Amplification or Diminution. For when it appears <lb/>
            what is good or evil, then is the time to shew how great, or <lb/>
            how little that good or evil is.</p>
          <p>Or in moving the Judge to Anger, Love, or other Passion. <lb/>
            For when it is manifest of what kind, and how great the good <lb/>
            or evil is, then it will be opportune to excite the Judge.</p>
          <p>Or of Repetition, that the Judge may remember what has <lb/>
            been said.</p>
          <p>Repetition consisteth in the matter, and the manner. For <lb/>
            the Orator must shew, that he has performed what he pro­ <lb/>
            mised in the beginning of his Oration, and how: namely, by <lb/>
            comparing his Arguments one by one with his Adversaries, <lb/>
            repeating them in the same order they were spoken.</p><pb n="347"/>

            <title type="main">GENERAL QUESTIONS ON THE JUDICIAL SPECIES OF ORATION.</title>
          </head>
          <p>IN treating of the judicial species of oration, what does <lb/>
            Aristotle propose that the orator should first consider in his <lb/>
            accusation ?</p>
          <p>If the question be simply whether his adversary has com­ <lb/>
            mitted an injury, the orator must prove,-what ? (chap. x. 2.)</p>
          <p>If an act of injustice has been committed, but that act of <lb/>
            injustice has not been defined by the written law, under which <lb/>
            species of law must he prove his case ? (chap. xiii. 14 ; xv. 4.)</p>
          <p>Am I then to understand, that in inquiring whether his <lb/>
            adversary has committed an act of injustice, the orator's first <lb/>
            business is to prove that he has acted for some end; secondly, <lb/>
            that he was a likely person to commit it; and thirdly, that <lb/>
            the object injured was a person likely to be injured ?</p>
          <p>Are these the three general points which he must prove <lb/>
            against his adversary ?</p>
          <p>What is the specific point he must prove against his ad­ <lb/>
            versary ?</p>
          <p>Why is the general question, Whether the adversary has <lb/>
            committed an act of injustice, (chap. x. xi. xii.) and the spe­ <lb/>
            cific question, Whether he has acted unjustly, (chap. xiii.) <lb/>
            distinguished ? (vide chap. x. 7.)</p>
          <p>To prove that his adversary has acted unjustly against the <lb/>
            state, or a private individual, what must the orator urge <lb/>
            against his adversary ? (chap. xiii. 7.)</p>
          <p>If the act is clearly done by a voluntary agent, on what <lb/>
            principle must the orator prove his adversary to have acted ? <lb/>
            (chap. xiii. 7.)</p><pb n="360"/>
            
          <p>If the act is clearly done by deliberative choice, what is <lb/>
            the next question an orator must prove against his adversary ? <lb/>
            (chap. xiii. 9.)</p>
          <p>To prove simply that his adversary has acted unjustly, how <lb/>
            many specific questions arise for the oratoris consideration?</p>
          <p>Are they not three ? <lb/>
            Ist. Whether he has violated the written law? (chap. <lb/>
            xiii. 9.) <lb/>
            2pd. If he has not violated the written law, whether he <lb/>
            has acted with depravity, so excessive as not to be de­ <lb/>
            fined by the written law ? (chap. xiii. 12.) <lb/>

            tempt to one's self or friends. <lb/>

          <p>Could you infer a reason from the definition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡδόνη</foreign> in the <lb/>

          <p>How many species of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> are there ?</p>

            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> from the definition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγωρία</foreign> ?</p>

          <p>I.-1. RHETORIC corresponds with Logic, since <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφότεραι <lb/>
            περὶ τοιούτων τινω̄ν εἰσιν</foreign>, &amp; <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινὰ τρόπον τινὰ ἁπάντων ἐστὶ <lb/>

          <p>2. But since men do it not only <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκη̃</foreign>, but also <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ συνήθειαν</foreign>, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕξεως, εἴη ἂν αὐτό κα</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁδοποιει̃ν</foreign>, and therefore <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν αἰτίαν θεω­ <lb/>
            ρει̃ν ἐνδέχεται</foreign>. Consequently, there must be an art of Rhetoric.</p>
          <p>3. But previous writers have done but little towards it, for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ πίστεις ἔντεχνόν ἐστι</foreign> <unclear>μóνoν·</unclear> ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>' <unclear>ἀλλα</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσθη̃και</foreign>, and they <lb/>
            have neglected enthymems, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅπερ ἐστ</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">σω̃μα τη̃ς πίστεως</foreign>.</p>
          <p>4. But appeals to the passions, ov <foreign xml:lang="grc">περ</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῡ πράγματός ἐστιν</foreign>,</p>
          <p>5. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ πρός τόν δικαστήν</foreign>* which is unjust, and avoided by <lb/>
            the Areopagus.</p>
          <p>6. The business of the pleader is only with the fact, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι <lb/>
            ὄστιν ἢ οὐκ ἔστιν, ἢ γέγονεν ἢ</foreign> ov <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέγονεν</foreign>* not with the question <lb/>
            of its importance.</p>
          <p>7. Laws would therefore be best, if they could mark out <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διορίζειν</foreign>) all cases, and leave but little to the judges, both <lb/>
            on account of the difficulty of getting many good men to legis­ <lb/>
            late, and because <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὶ μὲν νομοθεσίαι ἐκ πολλου̃ σκεψαμένων</foreign> yi­ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνονται</foreign>* <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ δὲ κρίσεις ἐξ ὑπογύου</foreign>* and because the legislator <lb/>
            does not judge for the present and particular case, but for the <lb/>
            future and universal, and is therefore free from prejudice or <lb/>
            passion.</p>
          <p>9. Therefore the exordium, narrative, etc. have nothing to <lb/>
            do with the art, as all that aims at making the judge <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιόν</foreign> rtva. <note type="footnote"> 2 c </note> <pb n="386"/>

            which are of equal extent with the arts themselves, in refer­ <lb/>

          <p>III.—1. There are three <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδη</foreign> of Rhetoric, as there are three <lb/>
            kinds of hearers, and the speech consists of three things ; 1. <lb/>
            o <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγων</foreign>. 2. <foreign xml:lang="grc">περ</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗ λέγει</foreign>. 3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρός ὅν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>2. The hearer is either <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρός περ</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̃ς δυνάμεως</foreign>, (the skill of <lb/>
            the orator,) or <foreign xml:lang="grc">κριτὴς</foreign>, i. e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κριτὴς ἢ τω̃ν γεγενηένων, ἢ τω̃ν <lb/>
            μελλόντων</foreign>, the latter being <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησιαστὴς</foreign>, the former <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστής</foreign>.</p>
          <p>3. Hence oratory is thus divided :—</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig56.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>8. In all three kinds we must have propositions on <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνατόν</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδύνατον, εἰ γέγονεν, ἢ ὅτι μέγα ἢ μη</foreign>, on <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγα</foreign> it <foreign xml:lang="grc">μικρόν, ἢ δίκαιον ἢ <lb/>
            ἄδικον, καλόν ἢ αἰσχρόν</foreign>, etc.</p>
          <p>IV.—1. Excluding <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδύνατα, ἀναγκαι̃α</foreign>, and and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύχης γε­ <lb/>
            νόμενα ἀγαθὰ</foreign>, Aristotle enumerates five things <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ ὧν συμ­ <lb/>

            comedy; of comedy indeed the Megarians, as well <lb/>
            those who are natives of Greece, as being invented <lb/>

            to have produced poetry in general. For to imitate <lb/>
            is congenial to men from childhood. And in this <lb/>
            they differ from other animals, that they are most <lb/>
            imitative, and acquire the first disciplines through <lb/>
            imitation; and that all men delight in imitations. <lb/>
            But an evidence of this is that which happens in the <lb/>
            works [of artists]. For we are delighted on survey­ <lb/>
            ing very accurate images, the realities of which are <lb/>
            painful to the view; such as the forms of the most <lb/>
            contemptible animals, and dead bodies. The cause, <lb/>
            however, of this is, that learning is not only most de­ <lb/>
            lightful to philosophers, but in like manner to other <lb/>
            persons, though they partake of it but in a small <lb/>
            degree. For on this account, men are delighted on <lb/>
            surveying images, because it happens that by survey­ <lb/>
            ing they learn and infer what each particular is; as, <lb/>
            that this is an image of that man; since, unless one <lb/>

              dignity. The metre also of tragedy, from tetrameter, <lb/>
              became Iambic (for at first they used tetrameter in <lb/>
              tragedy, because poetry was then satyrical, and more <lb/>

              nature herself discovered a suitable metre; for the <lb/>
              Iambic measure is most of all adapted to conversation. <lb/>
              And as an evidence of this, we most frequently speak <lb/>

              we seldom speak in hexameters, and then only when <lb/>
              we depart from that harmony which is adapted to <lb/>

            mits but a small variation from this period; but the <lb/>
            epopee is not defined within a certain time, and in <lb/>
            this it differs; though at first they observed the <lb/>

            others are peculiar to tragedy. Hence he who knows <lb/>
            what is a good or bad tragedy, knows the same in <lb/>

            of men, but of actions, [of life, and of felicity. For <lb/>
            infelicity consists in action, and the end is a certain <lb/>
            action, and not a quality7.] Men, however, are per­ <lb/>

            manners on account of actions; so that the action <lb/>
            and the fable are the end of tragedy. But the end <lb/>

            among painters Zeuxis is when compared with Poly­ <lb/>

            Again, it is likewise an evidence of this, that those <lb/>

            expressing a thing in tragic diction and manners ac­ <lb/>
            curately, before they can compose a fable, as was the <lb/>
            case with nearly all the first poets. The fable, there­ <lb/>
            fore, is the principal part, and as it were the soul of <lb/>
            tragedy; but the manners are next in rank8. [Just as <lb/>
            in painting, if any one were to spread the most beauti­ <lb/>

            the view so much as by outlining an image with white <lb/>

            and on this account, especially, [an imitation of <lb/>

            actions into a contrary condition; and this, as we say, <lb/>
            according to the probable, or the necessary. Thus <lb/>
            in the " Œdipus, 1” the messenger who conies with an <lb/>
            intention of delighting CEdipus and liberating him <lb/>
            from his fear respecting his mother, when he makes <lb/>
            himself known, produces a contrary effect. Thus, <lb/>
            too, in the “Lynceus," he indeed is introduced as one <lb/>
            who is to die, and Danaus follows with an intention <lb/>
            of killing him ; but it happens from the course of in­ <lb/>
            cidents, that Lynceus is saved, and Danaus is slain. <lb/>
            And discovery is, as the name signifies, a change <note type="margin"> 2. of dis­ <lb/>

            from ignorance to knowledge, or into the friendship <lb/>
            or hatred of those who are destined to prosperous or <lb/>

            beautiful, when at the same time there are, as in the <lb/>

            discovery. </note> <lb/>
            mentioned. For a discovery and revolution of this <lb/>
            kind will excite either pity or fear; and tragedy is <lb/>
            supposed to be an imitation of such actions [as excite <lb/>
            fear and pity]. Again, it will happen that in­ <lb/>
            felicity and felicity will be in such like discover- <note type="margin"> 5. Differ­ <lb/>

            ies. But since discovery is a discovery of certain <lb/>
            persons, some [discoveries] are of one person only <lb/>
            with reference to another, when it is evident who the <lb/>
            other person is, but sometimes it is necessary to dis­ <lb/>
            cover both persons. Thus Iphigenia was recognised <lb/>
            by Orestes through the sending an epistle4; but <lb/>
            another discovery was requisite to his being known <note type="margin"> 6. The <lb/>
            third re­ <lb/>

            pathos or <lb/>
            disaster. </note> <lb/>
            by Iphigenia. [Two parts of the fable, therefore, viz. <lb/>
            revolution and discovery, are conversant with these <lb/>
            things; but the third part is pathos. And of these, <lb/>
            revolution and discovery have been already discussed. <lb/>
            Pathos, however, is an action destructive, or lament­ <lb/>

            the purpose of tragedy is effected. Since, therefore, <lb/>
            it is necessary that the composition of the most beau­ <lb/>
            tiful tragedy should not be simple, but complex, and <lb/>
            that it should be imitative of fearful and piteous ac­ <lb/>
            tions—(for this is the peculiarity of such imitation) <lb/>
            -in the first place it is evident, that it is not proper <lb/>
            that worthy men should be represented as changed <lb/>
            from prosperity to adversity, (for this is neither a <lb/>
            subject of terror nor commiseration, but is impious,) <lb/>
            nor should depraved characters [be represented as <lb/>
            changed] from adversity to prosperity; for this is the <lb/>
            most foreign from tragedy of all things, since it pos­ <lb/>
            sesses nothing which is proper; for it neither appeals <lb/>
            to moral sense, nor is piteous, nor fearful. Nor, <lb/>
            again, must a very depraved man be represented as <lb/>
            having fallen from prosperity into adversity. For <lb/>
            such a composition will indeed possess moral tend­ <lb/>
            ency, but not pity or fear. For the one is conversant <lb/>
            with a character which does not deserve to be un­ <lb/>
            fortunate; but the other, with a character similar <lb/>
            [to one's own]. [And pity, indeed, is excited for one <lb/>
            who does not deserve to be unfortunate; but fear, for <lb/>
            one who resembles oneself2] ; so that the event will <lb/>

            twofold, (though some say it should be the latter,) <lb/>
            and that the change should not be into prosperity <lb/>

            some great error, either of such a character las we <lb/>

            subjects of <lb/>
            tragedy. </note> <lb/>
            the proof of this is what has taken place. For of old <lb/>
            the poets adopted any casual fables; but now the <lb/>
            most beautiful tragedies are composed about a few <lb/>
            families; as for instance, about Alcmæon, CEdipus, <lb/>
            Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, and Telephus4, and such <lb/>
            other persons as happen either to have suffered or <lb/>
            done things of a dreadful nature. The tragedy, there­ <lb/>
            fore, which is most beautiful according to art, is of <lb/>
            this construction. Hence they erroneously blame <note type="margin"> 6. An un­ <lb/>

            misfortune. For this method, as we have said, is <lb/>
            right; of which this is the greatest evidence, that in <lb/>
            the scenes, and contests of the players, simple fables <lb/>
            which terminate unhappily appear to be most tra­ <lb/>
            gical, if they are properly acted. And Euripides, <lb/>
            though he does not manage other things well, yet <lb/>
            appears to be the most tragic of poets5. The fable, <note type="margin"> 7. but <lb/>

            it is said to be the first composition, which has a <lb/>

            terminates in a contrary fortune, both to the better <note type="footnote">a What is here meant by a single fable, will appear presently <lb/>

            Modern audiences partake of this weakness. Thus, the <lb/>
            catastrophe of " Measure for Measure," " Cymbeline," or <lb/>
            " Winter's Tale," are more satisfactory than those of " Ham­ <lb/>

            who hears the fable of CEdipus is affected. But to <lb/>

            poet should procure pleasure from pity and fear <lb/>
            through imitation, it is evident that this must be ef­ <lb/>
            fected by the circumstances. Let us, then, ascertain <lb/>
            what kind of events appear to be dreadful or lament­ <lb/>
            able. But it is necessary that actions of this kind <lb/>
            should either be those of friends towards each other, <lb/>
            or of enemies, or of neither. If, therefore, an ene­ <lb/>
            my kills an enemy, he does not show any thing <lb/>
            which is an object of pity, neither while he does the <lb/>
            deed, nor when he is about to do it, except what <lb/>
            arises from the deed itself. And this will be the <lb/>
            case, when one of those who are neither friends nor <lb/>
            enemies do the same. But when these things hap­ <lb/>
            pen in friendships3, as when a brother kills a brother, <lb/>
            or a son his father, or a mother her son, or a son his <lb/>
            mother, or intends to do it, or does any thing else of <lb/>
            the like kind-such subjects are to be sought for. <lb/>
            One must not, therefore, [completely] alter the re­ <lb/>
            ceived fables. I mean, for instance, such as the <note type="margin"> 5. Fur­ <lb/>
            ther pre­ </note> <lb/>
            fable of Clytemnestra being slain by Orestes, and of <note type="footnote">black hangings in the " Fair Penitent," the scaffold in " Venice <lb/>

            Eriphyle by Alcmæon. But it is necessary that the <lb/>
            poet should invent the plot, and use in a becoming <lb/>
            manner those fables which are handed down. What, <lb/>
            however, we mean by [using fables] in a becoming <note type="margin"> 6. Exam­ <lb/>
            ples. </note> <lb/>
            manner, let us explain more clearly. Now, the action <lb/>
            may take place in such a way as the ancients have <lb/>
            represented it, viz. knowingly with intent; as Euri­ <lb/>
            pides represents Medea killing her children. Men <lb/>
            may also do an action, who are ignorant of, and <lb/>
            afterwards discover their connexion [with, the in­ <lb/>
            jured party,] as in the " CEdipus" of Sophocles. <lb/>
            This, therefore, is extraneous to the drama4, but is <lb/>
            in the tragedy itself; as in the " Alcmæon " of As­ <lb/>
            tydamas, or Telegonus in the " Ulysses Wounded 5." <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            Further still, besides these there is a third mode, <lb/>
            when some one is about to perpetrate, through ig­ <lb/>
            norance, an atrocious deed, but makes the discovery <lb/>
            before he does it6. And besides these there is no <lb/>
            other mode. For it is necessary to act, or not; and <lb/>
            that knowing, or not knowing. But of these, to in­ <lb/>
            tend to perpetrate the deed knowingly, and not to <lb/>
            perpetrate it, is the worst; for it is wicked and not <lb/>
            tragical; because it is void of pathos. [Hence, no <lb/>
            poet introduces a character of this kind except <lb/>
            rarely; as in the "Antigone," in which Hæmon <lb/>
            [endeavours to kill his father] Creon, [but does not <note type="footnote"> 4 The murder of Laius by Œdipus, his son, is supposed to <lb/>
            have happened a considerable time before the beginning of the <lb/>
            action. Twining. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Of these two dramas nothing more is known than the little <lb/>
            that Aristotle here tells us. In the first, the poet adhered so <lb/>
            far to history, as to make Alcmæon kill his mother Eriphyle, <lb/>
            but with the improvement, (according to Aristotle's idea,) of <lb/>
            making him do it ignorantly. The story of Telegonua is, that <lb/>
            he was a son of Ulysses by Circe; was sent by her in quest of <lb/>
            his father, whom he wounded, without knowing him, in a <lb/>
            skirmish relative to some sheep, that he attempted to carry off <lb/>
            from the island of Ithaca. It is somewhat singular, that the <lb/>
            wound is said to have been given with a kind of Otaheite spear, <lb/>
            headed with a sharp fish-bone. See Pope's Odyssey, xi. 167, <lb/>
            and the note. Twining. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Thus in Talfourd's " Ion," Ion discovers Adrastus to be <lb/>

            effect his purpose.] 7 ] For the action here ranks in <lb/>
            the second place. But it is better to perpetrate the <note type="chapter"> 8. </note> <lb/>
            deed ignorantly, and having perpetrated to discover; <lb/>
            for then it is not attended with wickedness, and the <lb/>
            discovery excites horror. The last mode, however, <note type="chapter"> 9. </note> <lb/>
            is the best; I mean, as in the "Cresphontes, in <lb/>
            which Merope is about to kill her son, but does not, <lb/>
            in consequence of discovering that he was her son. <lb/>
            Thus, too, in the " Iphigenia in Tauris," in which <lb/>
            the sister is going to kill the brother, [but recog­ <lb/>
            nises him;] and in the " Helle," the son is about to <lb/>
            betray his mother, but is prevented by recognising <lb/>
            her. Hence, as has been formerly observed, trage- <note type="chapter"> 10. </note> <lb/>
            dies are not conversant with many families; for <lb/>
            poets were enabled to discover incident of this kind <lb/>
            in fables, not from art, but from fortune 8. They <note type="chapter"> 11. </note> <lb/>
            were compelled, therefore, to direct their attention <lb/>
            to those families in which calamities of this kind <lb/>
            happened.</p>
          <p>And thus we have spoken sufficiently concerning <lb/>
            the combination of the incidents, and have shown <lb/>
            what kind of fables ought to be employed.</p>

            from the particulars respecting the sailing away [from <lb/>
            Troy 7]. But we must employ machinery in things <lb/>
            which are external to the drama, which either hap­ <lb/>

            we do not admit the introduction of any thing absurd <lb/>

            mode of discovery is through memory, from the <lb/>

          <p>IT is necessary, however, that the poet should form <note type="margin"> 1. Rules <lb/>

            that he may as much as possible place the thing before <lb/>
            his own eyes1. For thus, the poet perceiving most <lb/>
            acutely, as if present with the transactions themselves, <lb/>
            will discover what is becoming, and whatever is re­ <lb/>
            pugnant will be least concealed from his view. An <lb/>
            evidence of this is the fault with which Carcinus is <lb/>
            reproached. For Amphiaraus had left the temple, <lb/>
            which was concealed from the spectator, who did not <lb/>

            For the poet as much as possible should co-operate <lb/>

            naturally most adapted to persuade who are them­ <lb/>

            his plot. </note> <lb/>
            but the other is prone to ecstasy. It is likewise <lb/>
            necessary that the poet should in a general way lay <lb/>
            down the fables composed by others, and those which <lb/>
            he composes himself, and afterwards introduce epi­ <lb/>
            sodes and lengthen out [the play]. But I say that <lb/>
            he should give a general sketch after this manner. <lb/>
            Thus, for instance, in the " Iphigenia5," a certain <lb/>
            virgin on the point of being sacrificed, and vanishing <lb/>
            from the view of those who were to sacrifice her, and <lb/>
            being brought to another country in which it was a <lb/>
            law to sacrifice strangers to a certain goddess, she <lb/>
            is appointed the priestess of these rites. Some time <lb/>
            after, it happened that the brother of the priestess <lb/>
            came to this place ; [but on what account ? Because <lb/>
            some god had ordered him, for a certain reason which <lb/>
            does not pertain to the general view of the tragedy,] <lb/>
            to come thither, [but why he did so is foreign to the <lb/>
            fable6]. The brother, therefore, coming, and being <lb/>
            made captive, discovered [his sister], when he is <lb/>
            going to be sacrificed ; whether, as Euripides says, [by <lb/>
            an epistle,] or, as Poly ides feigns, speaking according <lb/>
            to probability, because he said, it was not only requi­ <lb/>

            must be <lb/>
            suitable </note> <lb/>
            ficed:—and hence safety arises. After these things, <lb/>
            the poet having given names to the persons, should <lb/>
            insert the episodes; and he must be careful that the <lb/>
            episodes be appropriate; as that of the insanity <lb/>
            through which Orestes was taken captive, and his <note type="margin"> 5. and <lb/>

            being saved through expiation. In dramas, therefore, <lb/>
            the episodes are short, but by these the epopee is <lb/>
            lengthened. For the fable of the Odyssey is short, viz. <lb/>
            a certain man wandering for many years, and perse­ <lb/>

            greatest and most of them, especially since men of <lb/>
            the present age calumniate the poets. For as there <lb/>
            have been good poets in each part of tragedy, they <lb/>
            now expect one poet to excel in all the parts. But <lb/>
            it is right to call tragedy different and the same, <lb/>

            but this [may be the case with those] of which there <lb/>
            is the same plot and solution. But many poets com­ <lb/>
            plicate well, and develope badly4. But both these <lb/>
            should always be applauded 5. But it is necessary to <lb/>

            fables; as if some one should compose a tragedy <lb/>
            from the whole fable of the Iliad. For in the Iliad, <lb/>
            on account of its length, the parts receive an appro­ <lb/>

            duced would be very contrary to expectation. The <lb/>

            Troy, and not some part of it, as the "Niobe" or <lb/>
            "Medea" of Euripides, and who have not acted <lb/>

            subject, than those of Sophocles; which, on examination, <lb/>
            would, I believe, be found true. For that this is the fault here <lb/>

            would think that Homer errs in what he is reproved <lb/>
            for by Protagoras? viz. that while he fancies he <lb/>
            prays, he commands, when he says, " The wrath, 0 <lb/>
            goddess, sing." For, says he, to order a thing to be <lb/>
            done, or not to be done, is a mandate. Hence, this <lb/>
            must be omitted as a theorem pertaining to another <lb/>

            not every such sound, but that from which an intelli­ <lb/>

            are indivisible vocal sounds of brutes, no one of which <note type="margin"> 3. Their <lb/>

            sound are, vowel, semi vowel, and mute. And a <lb/>
            vowel, indeed, is that which has an audible sound, <lb/>
            without percussion 4; such as a and o. But a semi­ <lb/>
            vowel is that which has an audible sound, with per­ <lb/>
            cussion ; as s and r. And a mute is that which, <lb/>
            even with the concurrence of the tongue, has of itself, <lb/>
            indeed, no sound, but becomes audible in conjunction <lb/>
            with things which have a certain sound; as g and <note type="margin"> 4. and dif­ <lb/>

            art. But a syllable is a sound without signification, <lb/>
            composed from a mute, and an element which has <lb/>
            sound [i. e. from a vowel, or semivowel]. For g r <lb/>

            clear translation. He observes: " Literally, percussion, i. e. <lb/>

            consonants, when vowels are prefixed, or put after them, to <lb/>
            make them separately pronouncible, (Te, eF, eL, etc.,) with <lb/>
            their powers in composition—as elements of words. Thus, it <lb/>
            is strictly true, that S and R have a sound, without the assist­ <lb/>
            ance of a vowel, merely by their mode of articulation. But D, <lb/>
            or G, have no sound at all by themselves. The semivowels <lb/>

            a sound void of signification, which neither impedes <lb/>
            nor produces one significant sound adapted to be <lb/>
            composed from many sounds, and which may be <lb/>
            placed either at the beginning or the end of the pe­ <lb/>

            placed by itself at the beginning; such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν, ἥτοι, <lb/>

            from more sounds than one, but naturally adapted to <lb/>

            significant without time, ot which no part is of itself <lb/>
            significant. For in double nouns, we do not use the <lb/>
            parts as of themselves significant. Thus, in the word <lb/>
            Theodorus, [though Theos signifies God and doron a <lb/>

            is of itself significant, in the same manner also as in <lb/>
            nouns. For man or white does not signify time; but <lb/>
            he walks, or he did walk, signify, the former indeed <lb/>
            the present, and the latter the past time. But case <note type="margin"> 10. Case. </note> <lb/>
            pertains to noun or verb. And one case, indeed, <lb/>
            [in nouns] signifies that something is said of this <lb/>
            thing, or is attributed to8 this thing, and the like; <note type="footnote"> 7 This description is most obscure ; but the sense seems to <lb/>

            case of a verb according to these species. And a <lb/>
            sentence is a composite significant sound, of which <lb/>
            certain parts of themselves signify something; for <lb/>
            not every sentence is composed from nouns and <lb/>
            verbs, (since the definition of man10 is a sentence <lb/>
            without a verb,) but there may be a sentence without <lb/>
            verbs. A sentence, however, will always have some <lb/>

            word Cleon is significant. But a sentence is one in <lb/>

            fies one thing, or that which becomes one from many <lb/>
            by conjunction 11. Thus the Iliad, indeed, is one by <lb/>

            Ten thousand valiant deeds <lb/>
            Ulysses has achieved9. <lb/>
            For ten thousand is a great number, and is now used <lb/>
            instead of many. And a transposition from species <lb/>

            And, <lb/>

            both imply the taking something away. But I call <lb/>

            the first is similar to that of the fourth to the third; <lb/>
            for then the fourth is used instead of the second, or the <lb/>

            because he did not attempt to sing of the whole of <lb/>
            the Trojan war, though it had a beginning and an <lb/>

            selected one part of the war, he has made use of <lb/>

            excelled all poets in diction and sentiment. The <lb/>
            epopee, however, differs from tragedy in the length <lb/>

            for it should be such that the beginning and the end <lb/>

            possess abundantly the power of extending its mag­ <lb/>
            nitude ; for tragedy is not capable of imitating many <lb/>
            actions that are performed at the same time, but that <lb/>
            part only which is represented in the scene, and <lb/>
            acted by the players. But in the epopee, in conse­ <lb/>

            introduced which have happened at the same time, <lb/>
            which are properly connected with the subject, and <lb/>
            from which the bulk of the poem is increased. Hence, <lb/>
            this contributes to its magnificence, transports the <lb/>

            heroic metre is established by experience as adapted <lb/>

            the only poet who was not ignorant what he ought <lb/>

            should speak in his own person as little as possible ; <lb/>
            for so far as he does so he is not an imitator. Other <lb/>

            seldom7. But Homer, after a short preface, imine­ <lb/>
            diately introduces a man or a woman, or something <lb/>
            else8 that has manners; for there is nothing in his <lb/>

            the error is twofold; the one essential, the other <note type="chapter"> 4. </note> <lb/>
            accidental. For the error is essential, when it at­ <lb/>
            tempts to imitate that which is beyond its power; <lb/>
            but [when it attempts to imitate improperly, as4] if <lb/>
            for instance, a horse should be described as moving <lb/>
            both its right legs together, or an error in any of the <note type="footnote"> giving occasion to them. It seems, indeed, intended as an <lb/>
            apology for Poetry, and a vindication of its privileges upon true <lb/>
            poetical principles, at a time when the art and its professors <lb/>
            were unfairly attacked on all sides, by the cavils of prosaic <lb/>
            philosophers and sophists, such as Ariphrades, Protagoras, <lb/>
            Euclid, etc., and by the puritanical objections of PLATO and his <lb/>
            followers. Twining. </note><note type="footnote"> If Ritter's strictures be true, our acquaintance with Aristotle's <lb/>

            Whence <lb/>
            objections <lb/>
            may be <lb/>
            removed. </note> <lb/>
            fute the objections of critics from surveying these <lb/>
            particulars. For in the first place, indeed, the poet <lb/>
            errs, if what he fabricates is impossible according to <lb/>
            the art itself; but it will be right if the end of po­ <lb/>
            etry is obtained by it. For we have before shown <lb/>
            what the end is, viz. if the poet thus renders what <lb/>
            he fabricates, or any other part of the poem, more <lb/>
            capable of producing a more striking effect5. An <lb/>
            example of this is the pursuit of Hector. If, how­ <lb/>
            ever, this end can be more or less attained, and that <lb/>
            according to the art pertaining to these things, then <lb/>
            the fault will not be excusable. For it is requisite <lb/>
            if possible to be entirely without error. Further <lb/>
            still, it should be considered whether the error ranks <lb/>
            among things essential to the poetic art, or foreign <lb/>
            and incidental. For it is a less fault not to know <lb/>
            that a hind has no horns, than to depict a bad copy <lb/>
            of one. Besides this, also, if the poet is blamed for <note type="chapter"> 6. </note> <lb/>
            not imitating things as they truly are, the reply is, <lb/>
            but he imitates them as they should be. Thus So­ <lb/>
            phocles said, that he described men such as they <lb/>
            should be, but Euripides such as they are. If, how­ <lb/>
            ever, it should be objected, that the poet represents <lb/>
            things in neither of these ways, he may say that he <lb/>
            represents them as men say they are; as, for in­ <lb/>
            stance, in things pertaining to the gods. For per- <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>

            it is just as it may happen; as Xenophanes observes, <lb/>
            “At any rate they tell us such things6." Perhaps, <lb/>
            however, it may be said, that it is not better, indeed, <lb/>
            thus to speak, but that the thing was so; as in the <lb/>

              on what account, he speaks or acts; as whether it is <lb/>

              as, for instance, to foreign words: <lb/>
              On mules th' infection first began. <lb/>

              from what Glauco says21, [when he asserts that] <lb/>
              " some men presuppose irrationally, and then reason <lb/>
              from their own decision: and, having once pronounced <lb/>
              their opinion, reprobate whatever is contrary to their <lb/>
              [preconceived] opinion." This was the case with re­ <lb/>
              spect to Icarius. For the multitude fancy that he was <lb/>
              a Laconian. On this supposition, therefore, it is ab­ <lb/>
              surd that Telemachus should not meet him, on his ar­ <lb/>
              rival at Lacedæmon22. Perhaps, however, the truth <lb/>
              is as the Cephalenians say, viz. that Ulysses married <lb/>
              among them, and that Icadius, and not Icarius, [was <lb/>
              his father-in-law]. It is probable, therefore, that this <note type="chapter"> 17. </note> <lb/>
              objection is erroneous. In short, it is necessary to <lb/>
              refer the impossible either to the poetry, or to that <lb/>
              which is better, or to opinion. For, with respect to <lb/>
              poetry, probable impossibility is more eligible, than <lb/>
              the improbable and possible, and things should be <lb/>
              such as Zeuxis23 painted. And also [we may refer <lb/>
              the impossible] to that which is better24: for it is ne­ <lb/>
              cessary that the pattern should transcend those things <lb/>
              which are said to be irrational. The objection, also, <lb/>
              that something is irrational may be solved by saying, <lb/>
              that sometimes it is not irrational; for it is probable <lb/>
              that what is improbable may have happened. But <note type="chapter"> is. </note> <lb/>
              with respect to the solution of apparent contraries, <lb/>

              that they have without any necessity devised some­ <lb/>

            the estimation of their predecessors3. Hence, Mynis­ <lb/>
            cus called Callipides an ape, in consequence of carry­ <lb/>
            ing his imitation to a great excess. And there was <lb/>
            also a similar opinion respecting Pindar [the player]. <lb/>
            But as these latter actors are to the former, so is the <lb/>
            whole art of tragedy to the epopee. They say, there­ <lb/>
            fore, that the epopee is calculated for hearers of the <lb/>
            better sort, on which account it does not require <lb/>
            scenery; but that tragedy is calculated for the vul­ <lb/>
            gar. Hence, tragic imitation, which is troublesome <lb/>
            to the spectator, will evidently be inferior to epic <lb/>
            imitation.</p>

            not pertain to the poet, but the actor; since it is <lb/>

            Sosistratus did, and singing likewise, as Mnastheus <lb/>
            of Opus did. In the next place, neither is all motion <lb/>
            to be despised, since neither is every kind of dancing, <note type="footnote"> no doubt, extended to the whole imitative representation of the <lb/>
            theatre, including the stage and scenery, by which place is <lb/>
            imitated, and the dresses, which are necessary to complete the <lb/>
            imitation of the persons. Twining. </note><note type="footnote"> A “<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελκοντες τὸν Κορυφαῐον</foreign>—To imitate Scylla,—“ naves in <lb/>

            to see how the performer, at least while he was playing, could <lb/>
            well spare a hand for this operation.- This was even worse <lb/>
            than what we call humouring a catch; when, for instance, a <lb/>
            singer who is performing Purcell's " Fie, noy prithee, John," <lb/>

            but only that which is bad; and hence Callipedes <lb/>
            was blamed, as others now are for imitating light <lb/>
            women4. Further still, tragedy, in the same manner <lb/>
            as the epopee, may fulfil its purpose without gesture ; <lb/>
            for by reading, it is manifest what kind of thing it is. <lb/>
            If, therefore, it is in other respects better, it is not ne­ <lb/>
            cessary that it should be accompanied [by motion and <note type="margin"> 4. Rea­ <lb/>
            sons for <lb/>
            the supe­ <lb/>
            riority of <lb/>
            tragedy. </note> <lb/>
             <lb/>
            gesture]. In the next place, tragedy has every thing <lb/>
            which the epopee possesses. For it may use metre, <lb/>
            and it has also music and scenery, as no small parts, <lb/>
            through which the pleasure it produces is most ap­ <lb/>
            parent. To which may be added, that it possesses <lb/>
            perspicuity, both when it is read, and when it is <note type="chapter"> 5. </note> <lb/>
            acted. The end, too, of its imitation is confined in <lb/>
            less extended limits. For being crowded into a nar­ <lb/>
            rower compass, it becomes more pleasing than if it <lb/>
            were diffused through a long period of time. Thus, <lb/>
            for instance, if one were to put the CEdipus of <lb/>
            Sophocles into as many verses as the Iliad, Fit would <note type="chapter"> 6. </note> <lb/>
            be less pleasing]. Again, the imitation of the epopee <lb/>
            has less unity [than tragic imitation]; of which this <lb/>
            is an indication, that from any kind of [epic] imita­ <lb/>
            tion many tragedies may be produced. Hence, if he <lb/>
            who writes an epic poem should choose a fable per­ <lb/>
            fectly one, the poem would necessarily either appear <lb/>
            short, as if curtailed, or if it should be accompanied <lb/>
            with length of metre, it would seem to be languid5. <lb/>
            But if he should compose one fable from many fables, <lb/>
            I mean, if the poem should consist of many actions, <lb/>
            it would not possess unity. Thus, the Iliad and <lb/>
            Odyssey contain many such parts, which of them­ <lb/>
            selves possess magnitude, though these poems are <lb/>
            composed, as much as possible, in the most excellent <note type="footnote"> 4 Taylor has gone fearfully astray in his version, " for not <lb/>
            imitating free women"! The negative particle belongs to the <lb/>
            adjective. Twining observes: " as no actresses were admitted <lb/>
            on the Greek stage, their capital actors must frequently have <lb/>
            appeared in female parts, such as Electra, Iphigenia, Medea, <lb/>
            etc. This is sufficiently proved by many passages of ancient <lb/>
            authors; and among others, by a remarkable story of Polus, <lb/>
            an eminent Greek Tragic actor, told by Aulus Gellius </note><note type="footnote">5 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύδαρῆ</foreign>, milk-and-waterish, </note> <pb n="473"/>

            manner, and are most eminently the imitation of one <lb/>
            action. If, therefore, tragedy excels in all these <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            particulars, and besides this, in the work of art, (for <lb/>
            neither tragic nor epic imitation ought to produce a <lb/>
            casual pleasure, but that which has been stated,) it <lb/>
            is evident that it will be more excellent than the <lb/>
            epopee, in consequence of attaining its end in a <lb/>
            greater degree. And thus much concerning tragedy, <note type="chapter"> 8. </note> <lb/>

            <title type="main">ANALYSIS OF ARISTOTLE'S POETIC, WITH THE ORIGINAL DEFINITIONS.-</title>
          </head>
          <p>1.—1. ON Poetry in general, its species and parts.</p>
          <p>2. Now, all Poetry is an imitation, as also flute and cithern- <lb/>
            playing, but they differ either in the means, the objects, or the <lb/>
            manner of their imitation.</p>
          <p>6. Epopee imitates <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνον</foreign> rOI, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγοις ψιλοῐς ἣ τοῐς μέτροις</foreign>, <lb/>
            either simple or mixed.</p>
          <p>7. But custom has falsely connected the name of poet with <lb/>
            the metre only, and not with their manner of imitation, as is <lb/>
            shown in the case of Empedocles and Chæremon.</p>
          <p>10. Dithyrambs, nomes, tragedy, and comedy employ all <lb/>
            the means of imitation, but some do so all together, others <lb/>
            separately.</p>
          <p>II.—1. But since actions are the objects of imitation, the <lb/>
            characters must be bad or good, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακία</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ὰρετῇ</foreign> ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤθη <lb/>
            διαφέρουσι πάντες</foreign>; and hence men must be imitated either as <lb/>
            they are, or under a more exalted or more contemptible view, <lb/>
            as in the respective paintings of Dionysius, Polygnotus, and <lb/>
            Pauson. The same thing holds good in other arts, and in <lb/>
            Poetry, as is shown by Cleophon, Homer, and Hegemon re­ <lb/>
            spectively.</p>
          <p>4. And hence is the difference of tragedy and comedy, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὴ <lb/>
            μὲν γὰρ χείρους</foreign>, 4 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ βελτίους μιμεῐσθαι βούλεται</foreign> rwv <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῠν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>III.—1. The third difference is as to the manner of imi­ <lb/>
            tation. For the poet may imitate the same object, and by the <lb/>
            same means, but he may do so either, i. in narrative, i. e. by <note type="footnote"> * As I follow the text of Ritter, no analysis will of course be made of <lb/>
            such passages as are satisfactorily proved, by this scholar, to be spurious, <lb/>
            especially when such passages are but an analysis of what has been <lb/>
            already said in the Rhetoric. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
             <lb/>
            personating other characters, or in his own person. n. Or he <lb/>
            may represent <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντας ώς πράττοντας καὶ ὲνεργοῠντας</foreign>.</p>
          <p>2. Since, then, there are three differences of imitation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έν <lb/>
            οἶς τε καὶ ᾰ καὶ ὣς</foreign>), Sophocles agrees with Homer, because <lb/>
            both imitate <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς σπουδαίους</foreign>, but with Aristophanes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂτι τοὺς <lb/>
            πράττοντας</foreign>. [Hence the Dorians lay an etymological claim to <lb/>
            the invention of the Drama and Comedy, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δράματα, ὂτι μιμοῠν</foreign>­<figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig93.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               </p>
          <p>IV. Two natural causes of Poetry, i. To imitate is the <lb/>
            peculiar faculty and pleasure of man, as is evident from his <lb/>
            taste for images, pictures, etc., the resemblance even of the <lb/>
            worst objects causing satisfaction. And this results from the <lb/>
            pleasure felt in learning and forming conclusions.</p>
          <p>6. II. Moreover, rhythm and harmony are equally natural <lb/>
            to us, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μέτρα μόρια τῶν ῥυθμῶν</foreign> cori.</p>
          <p>Poetry, therefore, gradually arose from the combined ex­ <lb/>
            ertions of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὶ μιμητικοὶ</foreign> feat <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὶ μετρικοί</foreign>.</p>
          <p>7. And of these men oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεμνότεροι τὰς καλὰς έμιμοῠντο πράξ</foreign>­ <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig94.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
               <lb/>
              one writing hymns and encomia, the others satires, of which <lb/>
              Homer’s Margites was the earliest known.</p>
          <p>8. Iambic was the fit metre for vituperation. But Homer, <lb/>
            by substituting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ γελοῐον</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψόγος</foreign>, suggested comedy, for <lb/>
            his Margites has the same relation to comedy as the Iliad to <lb/>
            tragedy. 10. And the heroic and vituperative poets respec­ <lb/>
            tively became <foreign xml:lang="grc">τραγωδιδάσκαλοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωμωδοποιοί</foreign>.</p>
          <p>11. Tragedy and comedy were at first <foreign xml:lang="grc">άυτοσχεδιαστικαί</foreign>, the <lb/>
            one resulting <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰπὸ τῶν έξαρχόντων τὸν διθύραμβον</foreign>, but the other <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰπο</foreign> rwv <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ φαλλικά</foreign>; they then gradually increased, as im­ <lb/>
            provements presented themselves.</p>
          <p>13. AEschylus added a second actor, and gave the pre-emi­ <lb/>
            nence to the dialogue (see, however, the note). Sophocles <lb/>
            added a third, and introduced scenic decoration. While <lb/>
            tragedy remained in its simple, satyric state, the Trochaic <lb/>
            metre was employed; but, on its improvement, the Iambic, <lb/>
            as being the most naturally adapted to every-day discourse. <lb/>
            The Trochaic Poetry was <foreign xml:lang="grc">σατυρικὴ καὶ ὸρχηστικωτερὴ</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ <lb/>
            ίαμβεῐον μάλιστα λεκτικὸν τῶν μέτρων</foreign>.</p>
          <p>15. Episodes were also multiplied, and the other parts im­ <lb/>
            proved.</p><pb n="480"/>
            
          <p>V.—1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κωμῳδία έστὶ μίμησις φαυλοτέρων</foreign>, but not <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ πᾰ­ <lb/>
            σαν κακίαν</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ γελοῐον</foreign>, which is a part <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῠ αίσχροῠ</foreign>. For <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γελοῐον</foreign> is defined <foreign xml:lang="grc">άμάρτημά τι καὶ αἶσχος άνώδυνον</foreign> icat ov <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φθαρτικόν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>2. The progress of comedy, from its being for a long time <lb/>
            unpopular, is unknown, but its poets are known from the time <lb/>
            when it began to possess any form.</p>
          <p>3. The inventor of masks, dialogues, and an increased num­ <lb/>
            ber of actors is likewise unknown. But Epicharmus and <lb/>
            Phormis of Sicily first invented comic fables, but Crates was <lb/>
            the first Athenian who began <foreign xml:lang="grc">άφέμενος τῆς ίαμβικῆς ίδέας <lb/>
            καθόλου ποιεῐν λόγους καὶ μύθους</foreign>, to introduce dialogues and <lb/>
            plots of a regular character.</p>
          <p>4. Tragic Poetry and epic agree in imitating <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺςσπου­ <lb/>
            δαίους</foreign>, but epic differs from it <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ τὸ μέτρον άπλοῠν ἓχειν καὶ <lb/>
            άπαγγελίαν εἶναι</foreign>, and also ri <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήκει</foreign>. For epopee is <foreign xml:lang="grc">άόριστος <lb/>
            τῷ χρόνῳ</foreign>, but tragedy <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὺπὸ μίαν περίοδον ήλίου</foreign>. But at first <lb/>
            there was no such restriction.</p>
          <p>5. As all the parts of epic Poetry are found in tragic, <lb/>
            (but not vice versâ,) a judge of the former will be a judge of <lb/>
            the latter also.</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig95.jpg"/></figure><pb n="481"/>
            
          <p>9. The most important is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ</foreign> rwv <foreign xml:lang="grc">πραγμάτων ϭύϭταϭις</foreign>, for <lb/>
            tragedy imitates actions, not men, and manners only as far as <lb/>
            they are involved by actions. Hence action is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλοςο</foreign>f <lb/>
            tragedy.</p>
          <p>11. For it may exist without manners, but cannot without <lb/>
            action: the later authors are imperfect in manners.</p>
          <p>12. Nor would a whole string of well mannered incidents <lb/>
            please so well as a regular plot.</p>
          <p>13. And, moreover, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μέγιϭτα οἷςΨυχαγωγει̃ ἡ τραγψὸία</foreign>, <lb/>
            rav <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύθουμέρη ἑϭτὶν, αι̃τεπεριπετείαι καὶἀναγνωρίϭεις</foreign>. And <lb/>
            men arrive at perfection in diction and manners, sooner than <lb/>
            in constructing plots. [The rest of this chapter is a repeti­ <lb/>
            tion, and is inconsistent with Aristotle's own ideas in other <lb/>
            places. See Ritter.]</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig96.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>4. Again, whatever is beautiful, must not only have a pro­ <lb/>
            per arrangement of its parts, but must be of a proper magni­ <lb/>
            tude, neither too large for its parts to be comprehended, nor <lb/>
            too small.</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig97.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>VIII.—1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μυ̃θοςι</foreign>s one, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐὰν περὶἕνα ἦ</foreign>, as the authors <lb/>
            of Heracleids, etc. have wrongly supposed, but because it is <lb/>
            the imitation of one entire action, complete in all its parts.</p>
          <p>IX.—1. Moreover it is not the poet's province to relate <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ <lb/>
            γινόμενα</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷα</foreign> av <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένοιτο, καὶ τὰ δυνατὰ κατὰτὸ εἰκὸς, ἤΤΟ <lb/>
            ἀναγκαι̃ον</foreign>. For this is the proper difference between the <lb/>
            historian and poet, not the use of metre.</p>
          <p>3. And poetry is more philosophical than history, because <lb/>
            it regards <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ καθόλου</foreign>, but history <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ</foreign> KaO' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕκαϭτον</foreign>.</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig98.jpg"/></figure><pb n="482"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

          <p>confined to the adventures of a few families.</p>
          <p>6. Euripides, from his plots ending unhappily, is unduly <lb/>
            blamed.</p>
          <p>7. But a happy end pleases the weak feelings of the spec­ <lb/>
            tators, as also does the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διπλη̃ σύσταϭις</foreign>, where the play ends in <lb/>
            a contrary result to the good and bad.</p>
          <p>8. But this is better suited to comedy.</p>
          <p>XIV.—1. Scenic decoration may excite terror and pity, <lb/>
            but they should rather arise <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ αὐτη̃ς τη̃ς συστάϭεως, τω̃ν <lb/>
            πραγμάτων</foreign>, which is far better, and more suitable to the <lb/>
            poet's art.</p>
          <p>2. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄΨις</foreign> rather produces <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ τερατψ̃δες</foreign>.</p>
          <p>4. Now, terrible actions must be either between friends, <lb/>
            enemies, or persons indifferent. But if an enemy kill an <lb/>
            enemy, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδἑν έλεεινὸν</foreign>, as also with indifferent persons. But <lb/>
            it is between friends and relations that such events become <lb/>
            piteous.</p>
          <p>5. Now, we must not essentially alter the received subjects <lb/>
            of tragedy, but we must invent new ones, and use the old <lb/>
            judiciously.</p>
          <p>6. Now, this may be done in the following ways: I. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰδότας <lb/>
            καὶ γιγνώϭκοντας</foreign>, as Medea. 2. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγνοου̃νταςΤΟ</foreign> Set<foreign xml:lang="grc">νὸν, εἶθ̛</foreign> </p><pb n="484"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig101.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>And hence the development of a plot should arise out of the <lb/>
            plot itself, not out of the machinery, which should be confined <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰτ ἔξω</foreign>rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">δράματος</foreign>, things happening before or after the <lb/>
            time of action. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλογον μηδὲν εἶναι ἐν τοι̃ς πράγμαϭιν</foreign>, <lb/>
            but if so, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξω τη̃ς, τραγωδίας</foreign>.</p>
          <p>8. Like good painters, we must improve upon the original <lb/>
            we imitate.</p>
          <p>XVI. [Doubtful. The four kinds of discovery are, 1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ, <lb/>
            διὰ τω̃νϭημείων</foreign>, and these are either <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭύμφυτα</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίκτητα</foreign>, <lb/>
            which are the worst. 2. at <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεποιημἑναι ὑπὸ</foreign>rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιητου</foreign>, also <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἄτεχνοι</foreign>. 3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ μνήμης</foreign>. 4. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ συλλογιϭμου̃</foreign>.</p>
          <p>8. But the best is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ἐξ αὐτω̃ν τω̃ν πραγμάτων, τη̃ς ἐκπλήξεως <lb/>
            γιγυομένης δἰ εἰκότων</foreign>. Next to it, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ἐκ ϭυλλογιϭμου̃</foreign>. ]</p>
          <p>XVII.—1. The poet should put himself as much as possi­ <lb/>
            ble in the place of a spectator.</p>
          <p>2. And of an actor likewise, for he will best express agita­ <lb/>
            tion who feels it, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι' ὃἐυφυου̃ς ἡ ποιητική ἐϭτιν ἢ μανικου̃</foreign>.</p>
          <p>3. He should first draw out a general sketch of the subject, <lb/>
            then add the episodes, taking care that they belong properly <lb/>
            to the subject. They are short in tragedy, but serve to <lb/>
            lengthen out an epic poem.</p>
          <p>XVIII. [Doubtful. Every tragedy consists of two parts:</p><pb n="485"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig102.jpg"/></figure><pb n="486"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig103.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>But heroic verse admits of all these kinds. Iambic should <lb/>
            approach as much as possible to the diction of common life.</p>
          <p>XXIII. In narrative and hexameter verse, the story ought <lb/>
            to be dramatically constructed, as in tragedy, i. e. it should be</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig104.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>from history, which treats of events of one time, not of one <lb/>
            action.</p>
          <p>3. Hence the excellent management of Homer in not at­ <lb/>
            tempting to bring the whole war into his poem, but only <lb/>
            taking one part, filling it out with episodes.</p>
          <p>XXIV. The epic poem should also agree with the tragic <lb/>
            as to its kinds [simple or complicated, moral or disastrous?]. <lb/>
            Its parts are also the same, except <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελοποιΐα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄΨις</foreign>, for it <lb/>
            must have <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιπετείαι,ἀναγνωρίϭεις, παθήματα, διανοίαι</foreign>, and</p><pb n="487"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig105.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>3. It also differs in length.</p>
          <p>4. For it has the advantage of being extended by narrative <lb/>
            of many simultaneous actions, which increase the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄγκοςτου̃ <lb/>
            ποιήματος</foreign>, and also by different episodes.</p>
          <p>5. Heroic is the established metre of narrative poetry, for it <lb/>
            is <foreign xml:lang="grc">στασιμώτατον καὶ ὀγκωδέϭτατον</foreign>, but the Iambic and Trochaic <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κινητικα</foreign>, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν, ὀρχηϭτικόν</foreign>, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ, πρακτικόν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>6. A mixture of these metres is absurd.</p>
          <p>7. Like Homer, the poet should know when it is fitting for <lb/>
            him to speak in person.</p>
          <p>8. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαυμαϭτὸν</foreign> is necessary in tragedy, but in epopee <lb/>
            even <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἄλογονι</foreign>s admitted, which is most wonderful, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὸ <lb/>
            μὴ όρα̃ν εὶς τὸν πράττοντα</foreign>.</p>
          <p>9. And Homer has chiefly taught other poets <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ψευδη̃λέγειν <lb/>
            ὡς δει̃</foreign>, which is by a <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραλογιϭμός</foreign> on the part of the hearer.</p>
          <p>10. And the poet should prefer <foreign xml:lang="grc">άδύνατα καὶεἰκότα, μα̃λλον</foreign> </p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_03_fig106.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυθεύματος</foreign>, as CEdipus' ignorance as to the manner of <lb/>
            Laius' death.</p>
          <p>11. And the diction should be most studied in the idle <lb/>
            parts of the poem, where there are neither manners nor senti­ <lb/>
            ment. For these latter are obscured by over-fine diction.</p>
          <p>XXV. and XXVI. [ Very doubtful. As these two chap­ <lb/>
            ters are quite unintelligible, except in reference to the ex­ <lb/>
            amples quoted, it is of little use to analyse them.]</p>
