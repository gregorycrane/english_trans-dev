          </head>
          <p>THE appearance of a new translation of the seven extant <lb/>
            plays of Sophocles may appear almost like presumption, at a <lb/>
            time when Professor Jebb's masterly edition, combining <lb/>
            text, notes, and an English version, is gradually approach­ <lb/>
            ing completion; nor, indeed, would such a task have been <lb/>
            undertaken by the translator, were not his own efforts solely <lb/>
            directed towards replacing, without delay, the volume in <lb/>
            Bohn's Classical Library, for which the publishers have for <lb/>
            some time been seeking a substitute. When they suggested <lb/>
            this work to me, I pointed out, and they fully perceived, the <lb/>
            disadvantage, under which any less well-known scholar would <lb/>
            necessarily labour in following Professor Jebb over ground <lb/>
            he had so recently and so thoroughly explored. However, <lb/>
            as a translation of Sophocles was required for their old­ <lb/>
            standing series, and as further delay was undesirable, I <lb/>
            consented to undertake the work.</p>
          <p>Comparison between Jebb's great masterpiece of modern <lb/>
            scholarship and my own humble effort will not, of course, <lb/>
            be made by those qualified to offer an opinion; his is <lb/>
            essentially an edition, complete and exhaustive, for advanced <lb/>
            students; mine is merely one part of such an undertaking, <lb/>
            produced, too, as well for the general reader as for the <lb/>
            critical scholar. Again, the necessarily long time, which has <lb/>
            elapsed since Jebb's first volume appeared,-the “Œdipus <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            Tyrannus," in 1883,—and the period, which must yet elapse <lb/>
            before the edition is complete, coupled with the costliness <lb/>
            of the work, offer, perhaps, some excuse for the production <lb/>
            of a translation in a more popular form.</p>
          <p>Having used Jebb's text as a basis for the following <lb/>
            translation, I should wish, at the very outset, gratefully to <lb/>
            record my heavy obligations to him. To have neglected <lb/>
            this latest recension of Sophocles would have been mere <lb/>
            folly, though its very excellence has not infrequently caused <lb/>
            me a feeling of deep dissatisfaction with my own <lb/>
            attempts. The consciousness, too, that in places my own <lb/>
            version may seem to be a faint echo of the Professor's <lb/>
            inimitable translation, has not by any means decreased my <lb/>
            difficulties. Wilful plagiarism I can honestly disclaim; acci­ <lb/>
            dental similarities of expression may well be excused, for <lb/>
            such cases do undoubtedly occur in work of this kind, even <lb/>
            when one writer has never seen the book, from which he <lb/>
            may appear to borrow. Certain turns in translating become <lb/>
            almost stereotyped in classical circles; and in all versions, <lb/>
            that aim at literal accuracy, there must, in the nature of <lb/>
            things, be many verbal resemblances.</p>
          <p>If it be necessary to give reasons for the selection of Jebb's <lb/>
            text, one might shortly settle the matter by saying, that the <lb/>
            universal chorus of approbation, which has greeted the <lb/>
            periodical appearance of his volumes, is sufficient evidence <lb/>
            that it is generally regarded as the best; to have used any <lb/>
            other, under these circumstances, would have argued either <lb/>
            want of sense or want of appreciation. But there is a further <lb/>
            reason: printed, as his volumes are, under the auspices of <lb/>
            the Cambridge University Press, there can be little doubt, <lb/>
            that, even apart from the intrinsic excellence of the work, it <lb/>
            will ere long become the standard text for a large majority <lb/>
            of English students.</p>
          <p>So much has already been written elsewhere, and by more <lb/>
            able critics, on Professor Jebb's methods, that little need be <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            added here. Suffice it to say, that his text contains far less <lb/>
            of daring emendation, and far more of lucid correction,­ <lb/>
            where correction is necessary,-than any of its predecessors; <lb/>
            it is conservative in the best sense,-no MSS. reading having <lb/>
            been lightly rejected, and no conjecture admitted without <lb/>
            good reasons being given for its acceptance; cases of hope­ <lb/>
            less corruption have been noted, and temporary makeshifts <lb/>
            quoted or provisionally adopted for what they arc worth; <lb/>
            in no single instance have difficulties been slurred over; <lb/>
            and the result is a text, which, without any wide divergence <lb/>
            from authority, is completely intelligible. And this presum­ <lb/>
            ably is the kind of text, which any one, bent on translating <lb/>
            an ancient classic, would naturally select.</p>
          <p>Speaking of editions of Sophocles, Blaydes, in the preface <lb/>
            to his edition, wrote: " Of English editions of Sophocles <lb/>
            we cannot boast much"; and in a similar strain we find <lb/>
            Professor Kennedy saying: " An adequate edition of <lb/>
            Sophocles remains yet to be achieved in England." This <lb/>
            reproach to English scholarship or diligence can never be <lb/>
            urged again since the appearance, first of Professor Camp­ <lb/>
            bell's edition, and now of Professor Jebb's, which bids fair <lb/>
            to remain long without a rival. It was also to supply this <lb/>
            felt want that Blaydes produced his edition, which, deserv­ <lb/>
            ing as it was of the gratitude of scholars at the time of its <lb/>
            appearance, has now been pushed into the background by a <lb/>
            newer school of criticism.</p>
          <p>Blaydes' edition was too full of corrections of the text <lb/>
            and conjectural readings to have more than an ephemeral <lb/>
            existence. It is true he proposed to himself for his guidance <lb/>
            the famous dictum of Person : " The first care of an editor <lb/>
            ought to be to settle the text, so as to preserve a due medium <lb/>
            between rashness and timidity"; but it cannot fairly be said <lb/>
            that Blaydes altogether succeeded in following these lines. <lb/>
            Two great merits he undoubtedly had: he acted as a pioneer <lb/>
            to all who should go over the same ground after him, often <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            detecting errors, if not happily emending them; and secondly, <lb/>
            he has applied the following canon with good results,-the <lb/>
            interpretation of Sophocles by himself, that is, by a careful <lb/>
            study and comparison of his style and language.</p>
          <p>Blaydes belonged to that school of critics, who assume an <lb/>
            extensive and deep-seated corruption in all the existing <lb/>
            MSS., and regard conjectural emendation as our only <lb/>
            chance of restoring a text; whereas the criticism, of which <lb/>
            Paley, Campbell, and Jebb are, in recent times, among <lb/>
            our most distinguished English exponents, considers it <lb/>
            safer and wiser, as a general rule, to adhere closely to <lb/>
            the written text, so long as sense, metre, and grammar <lb/>
            permit it.</p>
          <p>The followers of the first school, as Paley points out, <lb/>
            reduce the text of an ancient author to little better than a <lb/>
            field for the exercise of ingenious guessing; and they run a <lb/>
            risk of at last entirely losing the original words of the writer, <lb/>
            and making emendations, not upon him, but upon previous <lb/>
            emendations. To translate from such a text would be hope­ <lb/>
            less work, and would necessitate innumerable footnotes <lb/>
            explanatory of the reading; added to which, any work, <lb/>
            based upon such a shifting foundation, would become <lb/>
            obsolete in the very short period required for the growth of <lb/>
            a new school of these wholesale correctors, who will have <lb/>
            none of their predecessors' work, but start at once on <lb/>
            a crusade of destruction against it, only to expose them­ <lb/>
            selves to as certain a fate at the hands of others like them­ <lb/>
            selves.</p>
          <p>Having explained, then, why and how Jebb's text has <lb/>
            been used, it remains for me to add a word on the footnotes <lb/>
            appended to this translation. These are both explanatory <lb/>
            of the text and of the more obscure allusions. Of the latter <lb/>
            I need say nothing. With regard to the former, they have, <lb/>
            as a rule, been added only on such passages as are well <lb/>
            known for textual corruption or difficulty. Occasionally the <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            Greek words have been cited in full, that those who have <lb/>
            not Jebb's edition by them, and yet are tolerably familiar <lb/>
            with the ancient language, may see the reading he has pre­ <lb/>
            ferred, or be warned, where conjecture has been resorted to. <lb/>
            In the very few cases, where any departure from Jebb's text <lb/>
            has been admitted, a note to that effect is appended, and <lb/>
            his reading given as well. Where two or more explanations <lb/>
            of a difficult passage seem equally plausible, they have <lb/>
            sometimes been all given; for in a writer like Sophocles, <lb/>
            who seems to aim at saying ordinary things in an unusual <lb/>
            way, there will admittedly be cases, in which a final decision <lb/>
            is well-nigh hopeless. Emendations, which have by this <lb/>
            time won general acceptance, have not been noticed, as they <lb/>
            have practically become part of the received text.</p>
          <p>In short, the aim has been to make these notes as few as <lb/>
            seemed consistent with clearness, and yet to enable even <lb/>
            those, who are using a different text, to see at a glance any <lb/>
            striking variations from it, and, as far as may be, to put the <lb/>
            best accepted explanations before them.</p>
          <p>It should also be added that Professor Campbell's valuable <lb/>
            edition of Sophocles has been consulted throughout, and <lb/>
            much help derived from his sympathetic treatment of a <lb/>
            difficult author.</p>
          <p>Students of Sophocles have indeed little cause for com­ <lb/>
            plaint nowadays, with two such works as Campbell's and <lb/>
            Jebb's before them, issued respectively by the Universities of <lb/>
            Oxford and Cambridge,—sufficient guarantee, if the names <lb/>
            of such scholars needed any such, for the high standard of <lb/>
            their work. The former of these, in an introductory essay, <lb/>
            supplies practically a complete commentary to the chief <lb/>
            “cruces ” in Sophocles; and this, together with the same <lb/>
            scholar's “Sophocles " in the " Classical Writers " series of <lb/>
            Macmillan and Co., will enable any student to approach the <lb/>
            poet with a fair hope of understanding his meaning and <lb/>
            realizing his beauties, and at the same time of getting to <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            know all, that intelligent study in the past has done to eluci­ <lb/>
            date his many obscurities of language and style.</p>
          <p>For a list of editions and works bearing on Sophocles, <lb/>
            ample information may be obtained from any of the follow­ <lb/>
            ing sources:—Professor Mayor's Guide to the Choice of <lb/>
            Classical Books " (new edition, George Bell and Sons); the <lb/>
            larger Dictionary of Classical Biography," by Dr. Smith; <lb/>
            the preface to Blaydes' edition of Sophocles in the Biblio­ <lb/>
            theca Classica, where a most useful summary of all pre­ <lb/>
            vious editions, with their characteristics, is given; the <lb/>
            special introductory note on this subject prefixed to each of <lb/>
            his volumes by Jebb.</p>
          <p>From these sources the following brief list of the most <lb/>
            famous editions is compiled.</p>
          <p>(i.) The editio princeps of Aldus. 1502. An excellent <lb/>
            edition, having nearly the authority of a MS. This <lb/>
            edition served as the basis of all subsequent editions <lb/>
            up to that of Turnebus, 1553, which then took the lead <lb/>
            until the time of Brunck, who judiciously reverted to <lb/>
            that of Aldus.</p>
          <p>(ii.) Brunck, in 4 vols. Strasburg. 1786-89. And in <lb/>
            2 vols. Strasburg. 1786. Both editions containing <lb/>
            the Greek text with a Latin version, and the scholia <lb/>
            and indices.</p>
          <p>(iii.) Musgrave, concerning whose edition Blaydes is <lb/>
            of opinion that, though it appeared later, yet it had been <lb/>
            made use of by Brunck. 2 vols. Oxon. 1800. Re­ <lb/>
            printed, 3 vols. Oxon. 1809-10.</p>
          <p>(iv.) Erfurdt, with scholia, notes, and indices. 7 vols. <lb/>
            Leipsic. 1802-25. His notes reprinted separately. <lb/>
            London. 1824.</p>
          <p>(v.) Erfurdt and Hermann. 7 vols. Leipsic. 1817. <lb/>
            Re-edited by Hermann in full. 1851.</p>
          <p>(vi.) Hermann. Leipsic. 1833-45.</p>
          <p>(vii.) Dindorf. Third edition. Oxon. 1849.</p><pb n="XIII"/>
            
          <p>(viii.) Hartung. Plays and fragments, with German <lb/>
            translation and notes. Leipsic. 1850-51.</p>
          <p>(ix.) Linwood. Latin notes. London. 1846.</p>
          <p>(x.) Wunder. Separate plays. Göttingen. 1831-50.</p>
          <p>(xi.) Schneidewin. Leipsic, Berlin, and London, <lb/>
            1851-53.</p>
          <p>(xii.) Schneidewin and Nauck. Separate plays. Leipsic. <lb/>
            1871-78.</p>
          <p>(xiii.) Blaydes (vol. i.), Paley (vol. ii.), in the Biblio­ <lb/>
            theca Classica. London. 1859-80.</p>
          <p>(xiv.) Campbell. Clarendon Press. 1879.</p>
          <p>(xv.) Jebb, still appearing in parts. Cambridge Uni­ <lb/>

          <p>Such are some of the more famous editions of the whole <lb/>
            of Sophocles. Of separate plays there have been almost in­ <lb/>
            numerable editors, some few only of whose names can here <lb/>
            be given. Among the best known are Lobeck, Donaldson, <lb/>
            Monk, Elmsley, Burges, Matthiæ, Campbell and Abbott, <lb/>
            Kennedy, etc., etc.</p>
          <p>Of translations in verse, those of Francklin, Dale, Plumptre, <lb/>
            Campbell, and Whitelaw are the most meritorious; but <lb/>
            there is as yet not a single complete prose version in English <lb/>
            deserving of mention.</p>
          <p>The MSS. of Sophocles are numerous, but very few con­ <lb/>
            tain all the seven extant plays.</p>
          <p>(i.) The oldest and best is the Laurentianus or Mediceus, <lb/>
            which contains all the plays, together with those of <lb/>
            Æschylus and the " Argonautica " of Apollonius Rho­ <lb/>
            dius. It belongs to the tenth or eleventh century, and <lb/>
            is known by the letters L or M. Cobet was of opinion <lb/>
            that all other MSS. were derived from this, but this <lb/>
            view is not generally held.</p>
          <p>(ii.) A Parisinus MS., known as A, contains all the seven <lb/>
            plays, with valuable marginal glosses; assigned to the <lb/>
            thirteenth century.</p><pb n="XIV"/>
            
          <p>(iii.) A Parisinus MS., known as T, containing the seven <lb/>
            plays; revised by Triclinius; some readings occur in it <lb/>
            which are not found elsewhere.</p>
          <p>(iv.) A Parisinus MS., known as B, said to be of high <lb/>
            authority; possibly V (the Vaticanus) was copied <lb/>
            from it, as it exhibits many resemblances; each of <lb/>
            these contains four plays only.</p>

            <title type="main">MEMOIR OF SOPHOCLES.</title>
          </head>
          <p>As with many another great poet, whose masterpieces <lb/>
            remain the wonder of all succeeding ages, very little is <lb/>
            known of the personal life of Sophocles; but this dearth of <lb/>
            detail is less to be regretted in the case of a writer, respect­ <lb/>
            ing whose age we have ample evidence. The poet is, to a <lb/>
            great extent, the product of his age, and, if we know some­ <lb/>
            thing of his environment, we shall be fairly qualified to re­ <lb/>
            construct his life even from rather scanty materials.</p>
          <p>Now the long life of Sophocles, extending from B.C. 496 <lb/>
            or 5 to 406 or 5, is coincident with scenes the most stirring <lb/>
            and names the most illustrious in the whole period of <lb/>
            Athenian, if not of Greek, history.</p>
          <p>Thus his boyhood would have been passed amid the excite­ <lb/>
            ment of the Persian wars, and his imagination fired by the <lb/>
            wonderful development of Athens, immediately the danger <lb/>
            of foreign invasion was over. He would have witnessed, in <lb/>
            his manhood, the rapid steps by which Athens mounted to <lb/>
            a position of power and splendour never attained by any <lb/>
            Greek state before or after; while, in his later years, the <lb/>
            various scenes of the Peloponnesian war, that great struggle <lb/>
            for supremacy between Athens and Sparta, unfolded them­ <lb/>
            selves one by one before his eyes. Death came to him at <lb/>
            a singularly fortunate moment. The battle of Arginusæ <lb/>
            had restored to Athens some of her old prestige, and, though <lb/>
            it was but a momentary success, the old poet did not live <lb/>
            to see all hope finally extinguished by the disastrous defeat <lb/>
            at Ægospotami.</p>
          <p>What a list of great names, other than those of general <lb/>
             <pb n="XVI"/>
            and statesman, crowds these ninety years! Æschylus, the <lb/>
            tragedian; Simonides and Pindar, the lyric poets; Hero­ <lb/>
            dotus, the historian; Euripides, the dramatist; Aristophanes, <lb/>
            greatest of all comic poets; Zeno and Anaxagoras, the <lb/>
            philosophers; sculptors like Phidias, Polycleitus, and Myron; <lb/>
            painters like Polygnotus; deep thinkers like Socrates and the <lb/>
            Sophists Hippias, Prodicus, and Gorgias. And these are <lb/>
            only a few of the great men of that age, with many of whom <lb/>
            so popular a poet as Sophocles was doubtless on friendly <lb/>
            terms. Little wonder then that his plays, the outcome as <lb/>
            they were of a period so intellectually rich, exhibit that <lb/>
            perfect workmanship and marvellous finish that have been <lb/>
            the delight and despair of all succeeding dramatists.</p>
          <p>Passing from the poet's surroundings to the actual facts <lb/>
            of his personal life, we find not only that our authorities <lb/>
            are extremely scanty, but also that much of what they tell <lb/>
            us is little better than the doubtful gossip which ever pursues <lb/>
            the steps of those who are something different from the <lb/>
            mass. An anonymous life of the poet, of uncertain date, a <lb/>
            brief notice in Suidas, with certain incidental remarks <lb/>
            scattered through the works of Athenæus, most garrulous <lb/>
            of story-tellers, or gleaned from the pages of the accom­ <lb/>
            plished Plutarch, are our main sources for the little that is <lb/>
            related about Sophocles.</p>
          <p>He was born in B.C. 496 or 5, at Colonus, an Attic deme <lb/>
            of great natural beauty on the banks of the Cephissus, within <lb/>
            easy walking distance of Athens. His father, Sophilus or <lb/>
            Sophillus by name, must have been a man of some means, <lb/>
            though his exact employment is unknown ; for he gave his <lb/>
            son the very best education then obtainable. And such <lb/>
            skill did the son acquire in music, dancing, and gymnastics, <lb/>
            and so naturally graceful was his figure, that he was chosen <lb/>
            in B.C. 480 to lead the chorus of young Athenians in the <lb/>
            triumphal dance round the trophy erected after the victory <lb/>
            at Salamis.</p>
          <p>Twelve years later comes a great epoch in his life. It <lb/>
            was the spring festival of the Dionysia, and Sophocles had <lb/>
            entered the lists with the veteran Æschylus. Public opinion <lb/>
            was divided, and it was only after considerable delay that <lb/>
            the Archon Eponymus, whose duty it was to select by lot <lb/>
             <pb n="XVII"/>
            the judges in the dramatic contest, hit upon the happy <lb/>
            expedient of calling upon the general, Cimon, and his <lb/>
            colleagues, who had just returned from Scyros with the <lb/>
            bones of the hero Theseus, to take the oath and decide <lb/>
            between the two. They awarded the first prize to Sophocles, <lb/>
            the second to Æschylus.</p>
          <p>According to Plutarch, the old poet was so mortified at <lb/>
            his defeat that he retired to Sicily; but Aristophanes, in the <lb/>
            “Frogs," depicts such a friendly feeling as subsisting between <lb/>
            the two poets, that we might fairly surmise other reasons for <lb/>
            the retirement of Æschylus from Athens. What the plays <lb/>
            were on this memorable occasion, we are not told. Critics, <lb/>
            who have gone deeply into the question, believe that <lb/>
            Sophocles exhibited the " Triptolemus," a play dealing with <lb/>
            the Eleusinian mysteries; but this is little more than guess­ <lb/>
            work.</p>
          <p>From the year B.C. 468 till his death, Sophocles enjoyed <lb/>
            unshaken popularity, gaining no less than eighteen or <lb/>
            twenty first prizes, and, even when defeated, never falling <lb/>
            below the second place, and that, too, with such a formidable <lb/>
            rival as Euripides, who began exhibiting in B.C. 455, a year <lb/>
            after the death of Æschylus, and gained the first prize in <lb/>
            B.C. 441, the very year before Sophocles made such a deep <lb/>
            impression with his “Antigone." It is said that, by way of <lb/>
            compliment to the author of this play, Sophocles was chosen <lb/>
            in that year, with Pericles and eight other generals, for the <lb/>
            subduing of Samos. He does not seem, however, to have <lb/>
            evinced any taste for military service; and Pericles is reported <lb/>
            by Athenæus to have said of him, that he was a good poet, <lb/>
            but a bad general. Not only, then, must Sophocles have <lb/>
            . been brought into close contact with the greatest statesmen <lb/>
            of the day, but it was also during this expedition, if we may <lb/>
            credit our authorities, that he made the acquaintance of <lb/>
            Herodotus, the father of historians. That a close friendship <lb/>
            did spring up between the two can scarcely be doubted, for <lb/>
            there is a fragment of a hymn to Herodotus written by <lb/>
            Sophocles; and further, the striking parallelisms in their <lb/>
            works suggest that one of them was more deeply influenced <lb/>
            by the other than would have been the case, probably, if one <lb/>
            had merely been familiar with the other's writings.</p><pb n="XVIII"/>
            
          <p>Of the latter part of the poet's life we have very few <lb/>
            details. It was the period of his greatest poetical activity, <lb/>
            and perhaps for that very reason the least marked by any <lb/>
            stirring incident. To these later years, from B.C. 440 <lb/>
            onwards, belong all his extant dramas. Still, it would be <lb/>
            unjust to suppose that he shirked his duties to the state. <lb/>
            On the contrary, we find among the ten <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign>, a <lb/>
            committee appointed to provide for the public safety after <lb/>
            the news of the disaster in Sicily, the name of Sophocles. <lb/>
            If this was the poet, which some have doubted, he would <lb/>
            have been performing a somewhat arduous duty for his <lb/>
            country at a very critical time and at a very advanced age.</p>
          <p>Towards the close of his life, his peace was temporarily <lb/>
            disturbed by the unfilial conduct of his elder son. The <lb/>
            circumstances were as follows: Sophocles had married <lb/>
            twice; by his first wife he had a son Iophon ; by his second. <lb/>
            a son Ariston. Now Ariston had a son called Sophocles, <lb/>
            for whom the old poet conceived so deep an affection, that <lb/>
            Iophon suspected he would leave him an undue portion of <lb/>
            his property. Accordingly he brought his father before a <lb/>
            jury of his tribe, charging him with senile imbecility and <lb/>
            consequent incapacity to manage his estate,-a charge from <lb/>
            which the old poet triumphantly cleared himself by reciting <lb/>
            to his judges that magnificent eulogy on his native place <lb/>
            which is contained in the " CEdipus at Colonus." All know <lb/>
            the dramatic sequel: how the judges rose in a body and <lb/>
            escorted the poet to his home after severely rebuking his <lb/>
            son.</p>
          <p>This is all that we really know of the life of Sophocles. <lb/>
            Neither the date or manner of his death are precisely <lb/>
            ascertained, but it probably took place either in B.C. 406 or <lb/>
            5, and as this would bring the poet to his ninetieth year, we <lb/>
            shall not, perhaps, be very far wrong in attributing it rather <lb/>
            to natural decay than to any of the more fanciful causes <lb/>
            which later writers, with an eye to realistic effect, have <lb/>
            delighted to invent.</p>
          <p>So died Sophocles ; full of years and full of honour, blest <lb/>
            in his death as in his life, having seen his country in her <lb/>
            triumph, and being spared the grief of her humiliation; <lb/>
            retaining his faculties to the end, and leaving behind him, <lb/>
             <pb n="XIX"/>
            if ever poet did, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κτῆμα ἐς ἀεὶ μᾶλλον ἢ ἀγώνισμα ἐς τὸ <lb/>
            παραχοῆμα ἀκούειν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The deep respect with which the memory of Sophocles <lb/>
            was treated by Phrynichus and Aristophanes is no small <lb/>
            evidence of his universal and well-deserved popularity; both <lb/>
            publicly made honourable allusion to him in the year <lb/>
            following his death. Why he was so popular is best <lb/>
            explained, perhaps, by the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὒκολος</foreign>, "a man of <lb/>
            easy temper," which Aristophanes so emphatically applies <lb/>
            to him. In him, too, Nature and training had combined to <lb/>
            produce almost the Greek ideal of a man,—a beautiful mind <lb/>
            in a beautiful body,-and this happy combination, together <lb/>
            with his even temperament, no doubt made it easy for him <lb/>
            to gain many friends and make few enemies.</p>
          <p>If it be worth noticing a charge afterwards brought <lb/>
            against him, that he was too much addicted to sensual <lb/>
            pleasures, a sufficient answer may be found to it in the <lb/>
            following sentence of Mr. John Addington Symonds: "That <lb/>
            a poet, distinguished for his physical beauty, should refrain <lb/>
            from sensual enjoyments in the flower of his age, is not a <lb/>
            Greek, but a Christian notion. Such abstinence would <lb/>
            have indicated in Sophocles mere want of inclination." <lb/>
            That he was no lifelong slave to his passions is proved by <lb/>
            the passage in the "Republic" of Plato (p. 329), where <lb/>
            Cephalus is telling Socrates how Sophocles, in his old age, <lb/>
            rejoiced to have escaped from carnal pleasure as from " a <lb/>
            frantic and savage master." These are scarcely the words <lb/>
            of a sensualist.</p>
          <p>A second charge brought against him is really scarcely <lb/>
            better supported. On a passage in the " Peace " of Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes (11. 696-700), some have built up a theory that <lb/>
            Sophocles, in his old age, turned a second Simonides in <lb/>
            his greed for gain. It is, of course, conceivable, as these <lb/>
            critics urge, that he may have found himself forced to work <lb/>
            for pay in order to meet his expenses; but the remark of <lb/>
            Aristophanes is far more probably a piece of banter, not <lb/>
            seriously meant; and even were it otherwise, the evidence <lb/>
            is far too slight to convict Sophocles of miserly avarice. <lb/>
            The feeling against taking money for intellectual work was <lb/>
            undoubtedly strong in Greece; this was one of the chief <lb/>
             <pb n="XX"/>
            causes of prejudice against the Sophists, that they taught for <lb/>
            pay; and, this being so, we can scarcely believe that, had <lb/>
            Sophocles offended in this respect, he would have retained <lb/>
            his popularity to the end of his life, or that his country­ <lb/>
            men would have paid him such extravagant honours after <lb/>
            his death as to institute a solemn yearly sacrifice to his <lb/>
            memory.</p>
          <p>One hundred and thirty plays were anciently ascribed to <lb/>
            him; of these, seventeen were regarded as spurious by <lb/>
            Aristophanes the critic of Byzantium ; there were also other <lb/>
            works that passed under his name. Seven tragedies alone <lb/>
            are extant, with a great number of fragments, mostly very <lb/>
            short and unimportant. These seven were generally sup­ <lb/>
            posed to have been the poet's best work,-the "Trachiniæ,” <lb/>
            perhaps, excepted, in which there are not wanting traces of <lb/>
            that inequality of composition noticed by ancient critics.</p>
          <p>Too little is known about the order of their production <lb/>
            for any dates to be given, save in the case of the "Antigone," <lb/>
            which is thought to have appeared in B.C. 440, and of the <lb/>
            " Philoctetes," which is assigned to the year B.C. 409. Both <lb/>
            of these won the first prize.</p>
          <p>The “ Œdipus at Colonus" was brought out posthumously <lb/>
            by Iophon, but is not on that account to be necessarily re­ <lb/>
            garded as a work of the poet's last years ; indeed, were it <lb/>
            not that this play shows signs of interpolations,-the work of <lb/>
            a later and less skilful hand,-it would scarcely be too much <lb/>
            to say that it is as fine as any, if not the finest, of all his <lb/>
            extant works.</p>
          <p>Several important changes are attributed to Sophocles in <lb/>
            the form and mechanism of the drama. Thus, by the <lb/>
            addition of a third actor, he immensely enlarged the scope <lb/>
            of the dramatic action. He increased the number of the <lb/>
            Chorus from twelve to fifteen, but gave it a more subordinate <lb/>
            part in the action of the play, while he reduced the number <lb/>
            and length of the choral odes. He is also said to have <lb/>
            introduced scene-painting. But the most important of his <lb/>
            innovations was the abandonment of the trilogistic form. <lb/>
            Tragic trilogies at first dealt with three portions of the same <lb/>
            story; Sophocles is said to have contended with three <lb/>
            tragedies wholly unconnected in plot, or even with one <lb/>
             <pb n="XXI"/>
            tragedy alone, instead of the old tetralogy, consisting of three <lb/>
            connected tragedies, followed by a Satyric drama.</p>
          <p>Lastly, owing to the weakness of his voice, Sophocles <lb/>
            broke through the custom of the poet appearing himself in <lb/>
            character, except, perhaps, in a few slight parts, where <lb/>
            this defect would not prove any serious obstacle.</p>
          <p>Any discussion of the style and language of Sophocles <lb/>
            must be omitted here as a subject requiring too lengthy <lb/>
            treatment for the limits of an introductory essay. Students <lb/>
            interested in the subject will do well to refer to Professor <lb/>
            Campbell's essay, to Mr. Symonds' article on Sophocles in <lb/>
            his Greek Poets," or to Mahaffy's History of Greek <lb/>
            Classical Literature," in any of which will be found an <lb/>
            adequate account of him, on whom the ancients conferred <lb/>
            the name of " the Attic bee " for the sweetness of his style.</p>

            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE great Theban legend, of which the fortunes of Œdipus <lb/>
            form a part, was so well known to an Athenian audience, that <lb/>
            Sophocles did not feel called upon to preface his play with any <lb/>
            account of the previous history of his hero. To a modern <lb/>
            reader, however, of the poet's great masterpiece some few intro­ <lb/>
            ductory remarks are almost indispensable for a full and ready <lb/>
            comprehension of the plot; and it is to supply this want that the <lb/>
            following brief outline of the story is given.</p>
          <p>Laius, King of Thebes, being childless, had consulted Apollo <lb/>
            at Delphi as to his hopes of issue, and the god had told him, <lb/>
            that he should beget a son, but lose his life by that son's hand. <lb/>
            Accordingly, when Jocasta, the queen, gave birth to a son, his <lb/>
            father, to avoid this danger, gave the babe to a shepherd to <lb/>
            expose on Mount Cithaeron, after first maiming the child by <lb/>
            boring a hole through its feet and so fastening them together.</p>
          <p>The shepherd, however, touched with pity, refrained from <lb/>
            actually killing the child, and gave it instead to another herds­ <lb/>
            man, in the service of Polybus, King of Corinth. This man <lb/>
            took the child to Corinth, where Polybus and his wife Merope, <lb/>
            being childless, adopted it as their own ; and as such it was <lb/>
            reputed, until, one day at a banquet, a man, heated with wine, <lb/>
            taunted the young prince with being no true son of the royal <lb/>
            house. Upon this Œdipus-such being the name he had re­ <lb/>
            ceived in consequence of the wounds in his feet-questioned his <lb/>
            supposed parents, and was partly reassured ; still, to set his own <lb/>
            mind completely at rest, he started off secretly to consult the <lb/>
            oracle of Delphi and learn the story of his birth. Apollo gave <lb/>
            him, however, no clear answer on this point, but thrilled him <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            with amazement and horror by foretelling that he should murder <lb/>
            his own father, marry his mother, and beget unnatural offspring. <lb/>
            His resolve is taken at once ; he will never see Corinth and his <lb/>
            parents any more. Accordingly he turns his steps towards <lb/>
            Thebes, taking the road through Phocis to Bœotia. On his <lb/>
            way, he comes to a narrow pass where three roads meet; a <lb/>
            chariot, carrying one man attended by a small retinue, is <lb/>
            coming in the opposite direction ; there is no room for the way­ <lb/>
            farer on the narrow track, and he is insolently bidden to stand <lb/>
            aside ; a quarrel ensues, in which CEdipus kills the occupant of <lb/>
            the chariot and all his followers, save one who escapes and <lb/>
            carries tidings to Thebes, that robbers have slain the king and <lb/>
            all his retinue save himself on the way from Delphi.</p>
          <p>Shortly afterwards, it may be surmised, CEdipus arrives at <lb/>
            Thebes, where he finds the city, already distracted by the ravages <lb/>
            of the Sphinx,-a monster sent by Hera to persecute the old <lb/>
            home of her rival Semele,—plunged into utter helplessness and <lb/>
            despair by the loss of its king.</p>
          <p>The distress of the Thebans is too great even to allow them <lb/>
            to make any lengthy inquiry into their monarch's murder. <lb/>
            Daily the Sphinx is propounding her dark riddle and exacting <lb/>
            a life for every failure to solve it. CEdipus succeeds, where <lb/>
            others have failed ; the Sphinx kills herself in vexation ; Thebes <lb/>
            is saved ; and the citizens, in gratitude, make the newcomer <lb/>
            king, and give him to wife Jocasta, the late king's widow. Upon <lb/>
            this the herdsman, recognizing in his new master the man who <lb/>
            had slain Laius at the pass in Phocis, but not daring now to <lb/>
            publish the knowledge, obtains the queen's permission to leave <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of the court, without exciting any suspicion.</p>
          <p>Some years elapse before anything occurs to mar the happi­ <lb/>
            ness of the new king ; he has children by his wife, two sons and <lb/>
            two daughters ; his subjects are devoted to him, and the land <lb/>
            has rest and is prosperous. Suddenly and without any apparent <lb/>
            reason a fierce pestilence swoops on the city ; there is a murrain <lb/>
            on man and beast, and the earth will not yield her increase. <lb/>
            All in their dire affliction turn to the great CEdipus for succour ; <lb/>
            he has saved them before, and he will not fail them in their <lb/>
            present need.</p>
          <p>It is this graphic point which Sophocles has seized for the <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            opening of his play. A body of suppliants, young and old to­ <lb/>
            gether, with the priest of Zeus for their spokesman, have ranged <lb/>
            themselves round the palace-altar to crave the king's assistance. <lb/>
            In answer to his fatherly and sympathetic inquiries, they tell <lb/>
            him, through their spokesman, of the wide-spread suffering; <lb/>
            adding that, next to the gods, they deem him most competent to <lb/>
            devise a remedy (11. I-57). CEdipus assures them of his sympathy ; <lb/>
            what they suffer is intensified in his case ; all he can do, he will; <lb/>
            indeed he has already sent Creon, his wife's brother, to ask <lb/>
            Apollo at Delphi what must be done. He is still expressing <lb/>
            surprise at Creon's long absence, when the approach of the latter <lb/>
            is announced (11. 58-81). The answer Creon brings is, that the <lb/>
            murderer of Laius must be found and expelled from the land, <lb/>
            which is still harbouring him. Difficult as it now is to find a <lb/>
            clue after the lapse of years, CEdipus at once confidently declares <lb/>
            that he will unravel the matter from the very beginning ; and, <lb/>
            with this promise, he dismisses the suppliants, and summons his <lb/>
            subjects to meet him forthwith for the purpose of a general in­ <lb/>
            quiry. (11. 82-150.)</p>
          <p>As CEdipus quits the stage, the Chorus, consisting of Theban <lb/>
            elders, chant an ode invoking all kindly deities to protect <lb/>
            their city against Ares, the dealer of death and pestilence. <lb/>
            (11. 151-215.)</p>
          <p>CEdipus re-enters, and bids all who know anything of the <lb/>
            murder of Laius speak, while he pronounces a solemn curse on <lb/>
            the guilty wretch, and on all who harbour him. At the same <lb/>
            time, he declares his intention of leaving nothing untried to <lb/>
            bring home the crime to the murderer. (11. 216-275.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus suggest that the best course will be to summon <lb/>
            the prophet Teiresias ; to which CEdipus rejoins, that he has <lb/>
            already done so ; and, as they are still speaking, the aged pro­ <lb/>
            phet is led in (11. 275-299). The king entreats him to use his <lb/>
            best skill to rescue the State ; but Teiresias is very reluctant to <lb/>
            speak ; so much so that CEdipus is wroth with him and rebukes <lb/>
            him for his selfishness in concealing knowledge, which would <lb/>
            benefit the community ; even going so far as to accuse the old <lb/>
            man of complicity in the crime. Then, at last, Teiresias speaks <lb/>
            and declares that the denier of the land is no other than CEdipus <lb/>
            himself, who is not only a murderer, but is guilty of yet deeper <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            shame. At this unexpected accusation, CEdipus loses all self- <lb/>
            control and taunts the prophet with blindness in his art as in <lb/>
            his eyes (11. 300-377). Next he accuses Creon of having suborned <lb/>
            the seer, in order to serve his own ambitious schemes to gain <lb/>
            the throne. " This prophet," he exclaims, " is a mere charlatan. <lb/>
            Why, when the Sphinx was here, had he no good advice to <lb/>
            offer? Well, he shall rue his villainy." The Chorus mildly <lb/>
            interpose ; but the quarrel has become too heated to end here, <lb/>
            and Teiresias in impressive language pronounces on CEdipus his <lb/>
            coming doom, and hints at the awful abyss of misery in which <lb/>
            he will soon be plunged, when the truth is all revealed (11. 378- <lb/>
            428). CEdipus calls upon his servants to remove this prophet <lb/>
            of evil from his sight ; but, before the seer quits the stage, he <lb/>
            repeats his prophecies and bids the king take heed of them and <lb/>
            judge of his skill by the result. (11. 429-462.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus have heard what the prophet says, but they will <lb/>
            not yet believe that CEdipus is guilty. Who can the murderer <lb/>
            be ? Let him fly without delay ; doubtless he is already a wan­ <lb/>
            derer in secret places ; it cannot surely be Œdipus who has <lb/>
            done the deed ; the prophet is mortal after all, and may be <lb/>
            wrong ; CEdipus has ever served the State; it is impossible to <lb/>
            believe in his guilt. (11. 463-511.)</p>
          <p>Meantime Creon, having heard of the vile insinuations against <lb/>
            his loyalty, comes in excitedly to learn why such baseless charges <lb/>
            have been brought. CEdipus, however, now accuses him to his <lb/>
            face, and refuses to listen, when Creon attempts to clear himself <lb/>
            and prove the unreasonableness of the king's suspicions (11. <lb/>
            512-615.) The Chorus endeavour to mediate,--but in vain ; and <lb/>
            the quarrel is becoming every moment more bitter, when Jocasta <lb/>
            enters and bids Creon depart, and her husband forbear. Creon <lb/>
            imprecates a curse upon himself, if he has done aught treason­ <lb/>
            able, and then leaves the stage, though CEdipus is still far from <lb/>
            pacified by the queen's intervention. (11. 616-677.)</p>
          <p>Then follows a long conversation between CEdipus and Jocasta. <lb/>
            CEdipus relates what Teiresias has predicted ; whereupon Jocasta <lb/>
            cuts him short, by saying that little faith is to be put in oracles, <lb/>
            instancing the case of Laius, of whom it was foretold,—if not by <lb/>
            Apollo, at least by his ministers,-that he should die by the hand <lb/>
            of his own son ; and yet that could not have happened, for the <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            child was exposed on Cithaeron, when three days old; while <lb/>
            Laius met his death by the hand of robbers, at a place where <lb/>
            three roads met. (11. 678-725.)</p>
          <p>The mention of the spot, where Laius fell, startles (Edipus ; he <lb/>
            asks for a description of the murdered man, and every known <lb/>
            detail of the tragedy. Everything tallies with his own fore­ <lb/>
            bodings ; Laius must have been the very man he killed himself, <lb/>
            on his way from Delphi years ago; in which case he has put <lb/>
            himself beneath a curse, and is of all men most miserable. " But <lb/>
            who brought the tidings of the disaster to Thebes ?" " It was a <lb/>
            servant," answers Jocasta, " the sole survivor who came home." <lb/>
            " Then would I could see him ! " (11, 726-765). The queen replies <lb/>
            that this will be an easy matter, and then asks her lord why he <lb/>
            is so disquieted. (Edipus recounts the story of his life, telling <lb/>
            how he had gone to Delphi to inquire about the secret of his <lb/>
            birth, and how, in self-defence, he had killed a man on his way <lb/>
            back. From what he has since learnt, there is grave reason for <lb/>
            believing that it was Laius he then slew ; the only ground for <lb/>
            hope is, that the current story spoke of several actors in the <lb/>
            tragedy, not of a single wayfarer. Jocasta repeats that so the <lb/>
            story ran at first, and adds that, even if the sole survivor now <lb/>
            diverges somewhat from his former tale, there is small reason to <lb/>
            believe the predictions of prophets, seeing she has already had <lb/>
            convincing proof of their falseness, in the case of her own child. <lb/>
            " It may be so," says (Edipus, "but let the herdsman be sum­ <lb/>
            moned." (11. 776-862.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus offer up a prayer for purity in word and deed. <lb/>
            The impiety of Jocasta and the suspicion hanging over (Edipus <lb/>
            fill them with consternation ; they feel that such irreverence and <lb/>
            high-flown pride are but preludes to something worse ; the <lb/>
            eternal laws of right and wrong must be observed, and whoso <lb/>
            transgresses these will surely fall; the oracles of the gods cannot <lb/>
            come to naught; Apollo must and will defend his honour, which <lb/>
            is endangered by the scepticism now in vogue (11. 863-910.)</p>
          <p>But the queen has not really lost all faith in the gods ; only <lb/>
            she feels that their prophets may have erred. Troubled, as she <lb/>
            is, by her lord's anxiety, she determines to offer prayer to <lb/>
            Apollo; but as she is on her way to do so, a messenger from <lb/>
            Corinth encounters her with the news, that Polybus, the reputed <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            father of CEdipus, is dead, and that the people have sent to offer <lb/>
            the throne to her husband. Overcome with joy, she sends a <lb/>
            servant to fetch CEdipus, exclaiming exultantly, "Oh ye oracles <lb/>
            of the gods, look where ye now are ! " (11. 911-949.) In this ex­ <lb/>
            pression of relief and joy CEdipus joins ; one cause of alarm is <lb/>
            gone ; he cannot now become his father's murderer ; but there <lb/>
            is still the risk of marriage with his mother, Merope. The mes­ <lb/>
            senger, who has overheard part of the conversation, thinking to <lb/>
            relieve the king's mind, tells him he has nothing to fear from <lb/>
            that quarter, since he is not the son of Poly bus and Merope at <lb/>
            all, but a foundling from Mount Cithaeron, whom the royal pair <lb/>
            had adopted. He then tells CEdipus how he was himself once a <lb/>
            shepherd on the mountain, and, whilst there, received a babe, <lb/>
            with maimed feet, from another herdsman,—one, he thinks, who <lb/>
            was in the service of Laius. (11. 950-1042.)</p>
          <p>CEdipus inquires, if anyone present knows aught of this herds­ <lb/>
            man, and appeals to Jocasta to know, if it is the man they have <lb/>
            already summoned. Jocasta, on whom the whole truth has now <lb/>
            flashed in its terrible reality, endeavours to parry her husband's <lb/>
            questions ; but he is resolute to discover all, entirely misunder­ <lb/>
            standing Jocasta's motives for wishing to break off the quest. <lb/>
            Unable to shake his resolve, the queen, with one cry of <lb/>
            agony, rushes into the palace, not to appear again. (11. 1043- <lb/>
            1072.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus are struck by the intensity of the queen's grief <lb/>
            but the eyes of CEdipus are blinded, and he attributes her sorrow <lb/>
            and silence to pride and the fear that her husband may prove of <lb/>
            lowly birth ; but what cares he,-child of Fortune as he is? <lb/>
            (11. 1073-1085.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus seem to be reassured by their master's bold <lb/>
            words, and, in a joyous ode, predict, that, ere long, CEdipus will <lb/>
            be found a true Theban, and, it may be, the son of some god. <lb/>
            (1086- 1109.)</p>
          <p>But the catastrophe is very near. The Theban herdsman is <lb/>
            brought in and confronted with his old comrade from Corinth. <lb/>
            Most unwillingly he admits that he knows the Corinthian shep­ <lb/>
            herd, who, on his part, is only too eager to boast of his own share <lb/>
            in the past. Word by word the truth is wrested from the old <lb/>
            Theban, but not before CEdipus has threatened him with severe <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            punishment for refusing to speak. CEdipus, the King of Thebes, <lb/>
            and Jocasta's babe, which was exposed on Cithaeron, are one <lb/>
            and the same. The truth is out, and it is CEdipus who has <lb/>
            brought it to light. Now he knows the worst ; no need now to <lb/>
            ask the other question—“ Who slew Laius ? " With a bitter cry <lb/>
            he rushes frantically into the palace. (11. 1110-1185.)</p>
          <p>" How vain is mortal life "-chant the Chorus ; " here is <lb/>
            CEdipus, once the saviour of Thebes, but now the most wretched <lb/>
            of all men living; his is a fate which warns us to call no earthly <lb/>
            creature blest. Time has found thee out; time has judged. <lb/>
            Would God we had never known thee !" (11. 1186-1222.)</p>
          <p>Scarcely have their lamentations died away, when a second <lb/>
            messenger appears from the palace, to tell how Jocasta has put <lb/>
            an end to herself by hanging, and how the unhappy CEdipus has <lb/>
            blinded himself with the golden brooches torn from his dead <lb/>
            wife's raiment, and is now bent on relieving the land of his pol-' <lb/>
            luting presence. (11. 1223-1296.)</p>
          <p>At this point, CEdipus reappears with bleeding eyes, bemoan­ <lb/>
            ing in wild grief the horror of his fate and filling the Chorus <lb/>
            with dread. " It was Apollo, Apollo "-he cries,—“ who drove <lb/>
            me to the frenzied act. Could I have acted otherwise? No­ <lb/>
            thing was left me in life; let some kindly hand lead me away, <lb/>

            saved my life on Mount Cithaeron ! If only I had died then, <lb/>
            all had been well !" Thus in pathetic strain he reviews the <lb/>
            past, attempting, as it were, to justify himself, until the arrival <lb/>
            of Creon once more humbles his heart, as he remembers the in­ <lb/>
            justice with which he had treated his former subject (11. 1297- <lb/>
            1421). But Creon has not come to taunt him ; the past is past; <lb/>
            he has nothing but pity for the broken man, and it is with a <lb/>
            noble compassion he listens to his agonized laments, and under- <lb/>
            takes to perform his last requests. " Bury thy sister," says <lb/>
            CEdipus, " and let me wander henceforth on the hills,—aye, on <lb/>
            Cithaeron, my appointed tomb; and for my children,-leave <lb/>
            my sons to take care of themselves ; they are men ; but for <lb/>
            my daughters,—oh ! see that theirs is not a life of shame <lb/>
            and beggary! Would I could take them to my arms once <lb/>
            more !"</p>
          <p>Without a word, Creon, filled with a generous impulse, sends <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            to fetch the children, Antigone and Ismene ; and Œdipus, after <lb/>
            embracing them and addressing to them his last words, is led from <lb/>
            the stage ; while the Chorus chant the sad and solemn lesson of <lb/>
            the play: " Call no man happy, until he hath crossed life's <lb/>
            border, free from pain." (11. 1422-1530.)</p><pb n="11"/>

          <p>OED. Ah my poor children, full well I know the deep <lb/>

            trod full many a path in wanderings of thought; and the <lb/>
            only cure that I could find by careful inquiry, this have I <lb/>
            employed. I have sent Creon, the son of Menceceus, mine <lb/>
            own wife's brother, to the Pythian home of Phœbus, to learn <lb/>
            what I may say or do to save this city. And now the day,1 <lb/>

            not have tracked it far by myself, if I had not had some clue. <lb/>
            But now,-for I am counted one of you since those events, <lb/>
            —I make this proclamation to all you citizens of Cadmus : <lb/>
            " Whosoever of you surely knoweth the man that slew Laius, <lb/>
            the son of Labdacus, I bid him tell me all; yea, though he <lb/>
            is afraid, withdrawing the charge from others by denouncing <lb/>
            himself; for he shall suffer naught more harsh than this-he <lb/>
            shall leave the land unharmed;1 if, again, any of you knoweth <lb/>
            that a stranger from another land was the murderer, let him <lb/>
            not hold his peace; for I will pay his price2 myself and he <lb/>
            shall have my thanks to add thereto. But if, on the other <lb/>
            hand, ye will keep silence; if any, from fear, seek to thrust <lb/>
            these words of mine away from his friend or even from him­ <lb/>
            self,3 in that case must ye hear from me what I intend. I <lb/>
            forbid any citizen of this land, whereof I hold the sovereign <lb/>
            power, to admit that man, whoe'er he be, to his house <lb/>
            or hold converse with him, to make him partner in his <lb/>
            prayers to the gods or in sacrifices, or dispense to him a <lb/>
            share in lustral rites; all are to thrust him from their doors, <lb/>
            sure that he is our pollution, as the oracle of the Pythian god <lb/>
            hath just made clear to me."</p>
          <p>Thus then do I show myself an ally of the god and of the <lb/>
            murdered man. And my earnest prayer is this, that the <lb/>
            guilty man, whether he be some single undetected wretch or <lb/>
            have accomplices, may drag out in utter wretchedness his <note type="footnote"> had no clue,-and there was none. However, as I am now counted a <lb/>
            Theban, and it is imperative to track this crime, I make the following <lb/>
            proclamation to you all in the hopes of finding such a clue." Several <lb/>
            other views are discussed by Jebb in his Appendix to this play, note 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Retaining <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπεξελὼν αὐτὸς</foreign> of MSS. ; it is easy to supply in thought <lb/>

            on others !</p>
          <p>On you I lay this hest; fulfil all this, alike for my sake, <lb/>
            and the god's, and for this land of Thebes, thus cursed with <lb/>
            barrenness and angry gods. For even if this thing were not <lb/>
            of Heaven's ordering, it was not right that you should leave <lb/>
            it thus unpurged, when one of your best, and he a king, was <lb/>
            slain; nay, ye should have searched it out. So now, since <lb/>
            I have come to hold the sway, which erst he held, to take to <lb/>
            wife the bride that once was his, and since, had not Fortune <lb/>
            frowned upon his issue,' we should have had a common tie <lb/>
            in having children born to us by the same mother; but, as <lb/>
            it was, misfortune leapt upon his head ; wherefore I will <lb/>
            champion him herein, as he were mine own father, and will <lb/>
            go to every length in my efforts to find the murderer, in <lb/>
            the cause of2 him that sprung of Labdacus, from Polydorus <lb/>
            too, from Cadmus his forefather, and Agenor of ancient <lb/>
            days.</p>
          <p>And for all such as do not my bidding, I pray that <lb/>
            Heaven raise them up no increase of their land, nor offspring <lb/>
            either of their wives, but that they may be consumed by <lb/>
            their present fate or by one still more cruel than it.</p>
          <p>But for all the rest of you, the sons of Cadmus, who <lb/>
            favour these decrees, may Justice, who is on our side, and <lb/>
            all the gods be with you for ever for your good !</p>

            old, my trusted friend, in his eagerness to oust me from it, <lb/>
            hath stolen on me unawares, suborning such a juggling, <lb/>

            seeth only in the case of gain, but is blind as regards his <lb/>
            art!</p>
          <p>For, come now, tell me, where hast thou shown thyself a <lb/>
            seer? How was it thou hadst naught to say that could <lb/>
            release these citizens, when the hound, the riddling song­ <lb/>
            stress,2 was here ? And yet the riddle was not for the first <lb/>

            thou wert not seen to possess either from birds or from some <lb/>
            heaven-sent lore; but when I came, I, Œdipus, whose know­ <lb/>
            ledge was as naught, I made an end of her, succeeding by <lb/>
            my own good sense, not by lore derived from birds; this, <lb/>
            forsooth, is the man thou art trying to cast out, thinking to <lb/>
            stand by Creon's throne, at his right hand. To thy cost, <lb/>
            methinks, wilt thou drive out the curse, both thou and the <lb/>
            framer of this plot; wert thou not, to all seeming, an old man, <lb/>

            shall never stand enrolled under Creon's patronage. 1 And <lb/>
            I tell thee, since thou hast e'en mocked at my blindness, <lb/>

            thou hast been a foe to thine own kin, there in the world <lb/>
            below, and here on earth above, without knowing it; and <lb/>
            one day shall a twofold curse, with footsteps dread-the curse <lb/>
            of thy mother and thy sire-drive thee forth from this land, <lb/>

            where will thy cries not find a resting-place, and will not all <lb/>
            Cithaeron soon re-echo them, when thou hast learnt the <lb/>
            import of that marriage-hymn, which welcomed thee home <lb/>
            to thy harbourless port after a prosperous voyage? And <lb/>
            plenteous other woes there be, as yet beyond thy ken, which <lb/>
            shall bring thee to a level with thyself and thy own children.'l <lb/>

            thing possessed of the diviner's art. Of this will I show thee <lb/>
            proof concise. There came an oracle, one day, to Laius,— <lb/>
            from Phcebus's own lips I will not say, but from his minis­ <lb/>
            ters,—saying that death's doom would come on 1 him at the <lb/>
            hand of his son, one that should be born of me and him. <lb/>
            As for him, robbers from another land slew him one day,­ <lb/>
            at least, so rumour says,-where three main roads converged; <lb/>
            while for the child, three days had not passed from his birth <lb/>
            when his father cast him forth on a trackless mountain-side <lb/>
            by the hands of others, after he had fastened his ankles <lb/>
            together. In that case, then, Apollo failed; the son never <lb/>
            became his father's murderer, nor was Laius slain 2 by his <lb/>
            child,-the fearful fate he dreaded. This is how seers, with <lb/>
            their inspired utterances, determine things; do not thou <lb/>
            then heed them at all; for God will himself reveal-and <lb/>
            easily—whate'er he needs and seeks.</p>

            and questioned them; and they were very wroth with him <lb/>
            who fired that random shot, for the reproach thereof. So I <lb/>
            took comfort as regarded them, but still this taunt was ever <lb/>

            stars, 1 seeking some spot where I should ne'er behold the <lb/>
            shameful issue of my direful prophecies. Thus, as I went <lb/>
            my way, I came to the very place where thou sayest this <lb/>
            king was slain. Lady,2 I will tell thee the truth. When, as <lb/>
            I journeyed on, I was near that threefold road, there met <lb/>
            me there a herald, and a man riding in a carriage drawn by <lb/>
            young horses, just as thou sayest; and he who led the way, <lb/>
            and the old man no less, were for driving me from the road <lb/>
            by force ; wherefore in wrath I smote the driver, even him <lb/>
            who tried to turn me from the path ; and when the old man <lb/>
            saw it, he watched for me to pass, and then from his chariot <lb/>
            smote me full upon the head with a two-pronged goad. <lb/>
            Yet no mere quittance did he pay for that; one short sharp <lb/>
            blow from the staff I carried, and he was straightway reel­ <lb/>
            ing backward from the middle of the car; and I slew them <lb/>
            one and all.</p>
          <p>Now if this stranger was in any way related to Laius, who <lb/>
            is now more luckless than myself? Who could be more <lb/>
            heaven-detested? A man whom no 3 stranger or citizen <lb/>
            may welcome to his house, nor yet accost, but drive from <lb/>
            his doors ! And this-this curse I say—I, and I alone, have <lb/>
            laid upon myself. The bed of the murdered man am I <lb/>
            polluting, with these hands of mine by which he died. Am <lb/>
            I not vile and utterly unclean ? Exiled as I must be, and <lb/>
            in my exile ne'er set eyes on those I love, nor tread my <lb/>
            native soil, or else be wedded to my mother and slay my <lb/>
            father Polybus, who begat and brought me up.4 <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e., keeping far from it, and only knowing its position by the stars. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 L. 800 is originally wanting in L, and is therefore rejected by <lb/>

            at least until thou hast learnt all from the eye-witness.</p>

            herdsman's coming,-that and nothing more.</p>
          <p>Joc. And when he appears, what art thou bent on <lb/>
            doing ?</p>

            story as thine, I, at any rate, shall be cleared of calamity.1</p>
          <p>Joc. What was there remarkable in the story I told thee ?</p>
          <p>OED. Thou saidst that the man spoke of robbers having <lb/>
            slain Laius ; now, if he still speak of a number, as before, I <lb/>
            was not the slayer; for one single man could not be the same <lb/>
            as the many he spoke of. But if he tell of one solitary <lb/>
            traveller, clearly this deed points, then and there, to me.</p>
          <p>Joc. Well, rest assured that was the way the story was set <lb/>
            forth ; and this can he not retract, for the city heard it, not <lb/>
            I alone But even should he swerve at all from what he said <lb/>
            at first, he certainly will never show that the murder of Laius, <lb/>
            at any rate, followed its strict course; seeing that Loxias de­ <lb/>
            clared, that he was to die by the hand of my child. Yet that <lb/>
            poor babe ne'er slew him, but died himself ere that. And <lb/>
            so, for all the seer's art can tell, henceforth will I look neither <lb/>
            this way nor that.</p>
          <p>OED. Thou reasonest well. Still send some one to fetch <lb/>
            yon labourer, and neglect it not.</p>
          <p>Joc. I will send with all dispatch. But let us go within ; <lb/>

            purity in all such words and deeds, as have set forth for them <lb/>
            on high a code of laws, whose birth-place is the heaven <lb/>

            seek the temples of the gods, bearing in my hands these <lb/>
            wreaths and offerings of incense. For the heart of CEdipus <lb/>
            is tossing all too much with divers troublous thoughts ; nor <lb/>
            does he, like a man of sense, judge of the new by the old; <lb/>
            but he is the sport of any speaker, if he tell of terrors. Now <lb/>
            therefore, since by my counsels I can do no good, to thee <lb/>
            have I come, Lycean Apollo, as being most nigh,-a suppliant <lb/>
            with these marks of prayer,3—that thou mayst find us some <lb/>
            release from guilt; for now are we all afraid at seeing <lb/>
            him thus terror-struck, e'en as had we seen our helms­ <lb/>
            man so.</p>
          <p>MES. Sirs, may I learn from you where is the palace of <lb/>
            CEdipus the king ? Or, best of all, tell me where he is him­ <lb/>
            self, if ye know.</p>

          <p>MES. From Corinth I come; and the word I shall speak <lb/>

            well.</p>
          <p>Joc. What is it ? What is this double power it bath?</p>

            man?1</p>

            O ye oracles of the gods, look where ye stand now I This was <lb/>
            the man CEdipus long shunned from fear of killing him ; and <lb/>
            now, lo ! he hath died in Nature's course and not by my <lb/>
            lord's hand.</p>
          <p>OED. Jocasta, dearest wife, why hast thou sent for me <lb/>
            hither from yonder palace?</p>
          <p>Joc. Hear this man's tale; and, hearing, see to what <lb/>
            those awful oracles of the god have come.</p>
          <p>OED. And who, pray, is this man, and what news hath he <lb/>
            for me?</p>
          <p>Joe. A messenger from Corinth, to say that thy father <lb/>
            Polybus is no longer alive, but dead.</p>

          <p>MES. A little extra in the scale sends old folks to their <lb/>
            rest.</p>
          <p>OED. 'Twas sickness then, it seems, that caused his death, <lb/>

            measured out.</p>
          <p>OED. Ah, lady, why then should one regard the altar of <lb/>
            the Pythian prophet, or the birds that scream above us, <lb/>
            according to whom I was to slay my own father ? But he is <lb/>
            dead and buried now, while I am here and have never <lb/>
            touched a weapon; unless, perchance, he pined away in <lb/>
            longing for me; and so I might have caused his death. <lb/>
            As for the oracles in our case at any rate, Polybus has taken <lb/>
            them away with him to his grave; they are with Hades now <lb/>
            and worthless.</p>
          <p>Joc. Well, did I not foretell thee this long, long ago ?</p>

          <p>Joc. Then give not a thought to aught of this henceforth.</p>
          <p>OED. But how should I not fear that union with my <lb/>
            mother ?</p>
          <p>Joc. And why should man fear aught, in whose life <lb/>
            Fortune reigns as queen, and who hath no clear foresight of <lb/>
            anything ? 'Tis best to live a careless life, howe'er one may. <lb/>

            whoso makes these things of no account, his is the lightest <lb/>

          <p>OED. Merope, with whom Polybus shared house and <lb/>
            home, old sir.</p>
          <p>MES. And what is there to do with her, that tends to fear <lb/>
            for you ?</p>
          <p>OED. A dread oracle of Heaven's sending, sir stranger.</p>

            blood. Wherefore Corinth, as a home, has long been far <lb/>
            away for me,—with Fortune's favour, it is true, but yet to look <lb/>
            upon our parents' face is very sweet.</p>
          <p>MES. Was it then from dread of this that thou didst hold <lb/>
            aloof therefrom ?</p>
          <p>OED. Yea, and from a wish to be guiltless of my father's <lb/>
            blood, old sir.</p>
          <p>MES. Then why have I not set thee free, 0 king, from <lb/>
            this alarm, coming, as I did, with kind intent ?</p>
          <p>OED. In sooth thou wouldst win due gratitude from me.</p>
          <p>MES. In sooth I chiefly came for that, that, on thy coming <lb/>

          <p>OED. Nay, I will never go to dwell with my parents.</p>

            father ?</p>
          <p>MES. No more than I am, but as much.</p>
          <p>OED. And how can he, who begat me, stand on the level <lb/>
            of one who is as naught to me ?</p>
          <p>MES. Nay, but he was not thy sire, nor yet am I.</p>
          <p>OED. But why, then, did he call me son ?</p>
          <p>MES. Know that he received thee as a gift one day from <lb/>

          <p>SEC. MES. The shortest tale for me to tell or you to hear <lb/>
            is, that our god-like queen, the lady Jocasta, is dead.</p>
          <p>CHO. Unhappy one ! what caused her death?</p>
          <p>SEC. MES. She herself. The worst of all that happened <lb/>
            is elsewhere; 'tis out of sight. Still, so far as mine own poor <lb/>
            memory goes, thou shalt learn what befell yon hapless queen.</p>
          <p>Soon as her frantic mood had carried her within the hall, <lb/>
            she rushed straight onwards to her nuptial couch, tearing out <lb/>
            her hair with both hands at once; and when she was inside, <lb/>
            she dashed the doors together and called on Laius, long since <lb/>
            dead, remembering their child of long ago, by whom the <lb/>
            father met his death and left the mother to bear unhappy <lb/>
            offspring to his son. Next she bewailed her marriage, <lb/>
            wherein, to her sorrow, she had borne a double race, husband <lb/>
            by husband, children by her child.</p>
          <p>After this, I know no more of the way she died; for <lb/>
            CEdipus burst in with loud outcries, preventing us from see­ <lb/>
            ing all her agony, but our eyes followed his randomsteps. <lb/>
            To and fro he rushed, craving a sword at our hands, and <lb/>
            asking where to find the wife, that was no wife indeed, but a <lb/>
            mother whose double throes had born himself and his <lb/>
            children too. And there was some god directing his frantic <lb/>
            course; for it was not any of us men who were there at <lb/>
            hand. With one dread cry, as though he had some guide, <lb/>
            he leapt upon the folding-doors, and, forcing the bolts from <lb/>
            their sockets till they bent,' headlong he sprang into the <lb/>
            room.</p>
          <p>And there we saw the queen hanging in a noose 2 of <lb/>
            twisted cords ; and as soon as he caught sight of her, with <lb/>
            one loud cry of awful agony, he loosed the dangling rope ; <note type="footnote"> 1 Others render, "bent the yielding doors out of their sockets." <lb/>

            then, when the hapless corpse was laid upon' the ground, <lb/>
            there followed a fearful scene. He tore from her robes the <lb/>
            brooches of gold, wherewith she was decked, and, lifting them <lb/>
            up, stabbed the sockets of his eyes, crying out that they <lb/>
            should see no more the horrors he was suffering or was <lb/>
            causing all this while, but henceforth should behold in dark­ <lb/>
            ness 1 those whom he ne'er should have seen, and know no <lb/>
            more those whom once he craved to know.</p>
          <p>The while he uttered this sad refrain, with lifted hand he <lb/>
            smote upon his eyes, not once but many a time; and, at <lb/>
            each blow, the bleeding eye-balls rained upon his beard, <lb/>
            sending forth not gouts of oozing gore, but one black <lb/>
            drenching shower of bloody hail.2</p>
          <p>Such are the woes that have burst forth from twain, not on <lb/>
            one alone,3 but blended ills for man and wife. Their old <lb/>
            happiness, long past, was truly such in days gone by; but <lb/>

            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>BETWEEN the close of the “CEdipus the King" and the opening <lb/>
            of the " CEdipus at Colonus ” a considerable period is supposed to <lb/>
            have elapsed. CEdipus, after the fearful disclosures made in the <lb/>
            earlier play, had remained at Thebes, while Creon administered <lb/>
            the government. By degrees, the blinded sufferer grew recon­ <lb/>
            ciled to his changed circumstances, and no longer felt any wish <lb/>
            to fly from the scene of his misfortunes; but, as time went on, <lb/>
            the Thebans came to believe that they were harbouring a pollu­ <lb/>
            tion, and CEdipus was expelled. His sons make no effort to <lb/>
            save him ; only his daughters remain loyal,–Antigone going <lb/>
            forth to share his wanderings, Ismene staying in Thebes to <lb/>
            watch the course of events and help her father, as occasion may <lb/>
            offer. But, one day, came an oracle to Thebes, which said that <lb/>
            on CEdipus alone depended the welfare of the city ; and thus it <lb/>
            became of paramount importance that the Thebans should induce <lb/>
            the old wanderer to return. Meantime, however, his two sons <lb/>
            have quarrelled. Polyneices, the elder, has been driven from <lb/>
            his native land by his brother Eteocles, and has taken refuge at <lb/>
            Argos, where he has married the daughter of the king ; with the <lb/>
            aid of the latter and his allies, he is bent on leading an expedi­ <lb/>
            tion to Thebes, to extort submission from his brother,-the one <lb/>
            thing essential to success being the presence of CEdipus.</p>
          <p>Such, very briefly, are the events which fill the interval between <lb/>
            the two plays. The scene of the " CEdipus at Colonus " lies be­ <lb/>
            fore a grove of the Eumenides at Colonus, to which the wanderer <lb/>
            has made his way, guided by his daughter Antigone. He is in <lb/>
            search of some resting-place, and is asking his child what spot <lb/>
            they have reached. Scarcely has he seated himself, after learning <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            that they are close to Athens, when a native of the place enters <lb/>
            and bids him depart and trespass not on holy ground.</p>
          <p>On learning that he has reached a grove of the Awful God­ <lb/>
            desses," CEdipus declines to move, remembering the words <lb/>
            of Apollo, that when he reached such a spot, he should at last <lb/>
            find rest. At his request, the stranger, who has accosted him, <lb/>
            goes to fetch Theseus, the king of the land ; and, on his departure, <lb/>
            Œdipus, after offering up a prayer to the Eumenides, withdraws <lb/>
            further into the sacred grove, as certain elders of Colonus make <lb/>
            their appearance. (11. 1-116.)</p>
          <p>They have come to see who this rash intruder can be. As <lb/>
            they are still searching for him, CEdipus comes slowly forward <lb/>
            from his place of concealment. His appearance calls forth an <lb/>
            expression of horror, and once more he is bidden to leave the <lb/>
            holy ground he has invaded. He hesitates, but yields at last <lb/>
            under a promise of protection from the elders of Colonus, and <lb/>
            takes a seat, as directed by them, on a ledge of rock near the <lb/>
            outskirts of the grove. (11. 117-202.)</p>
          <p>As soon as he is seated, the Chorus ask him who he is and <lb/>
            whence he comes. Word by word, the awful truth is wrested <lb/>
            from his unwilling lips, but at the mention of his name the <lb/>
            Chorus raise a cry of execration, and are half inclined to break <lb/>
            their promise and send him forth from the land ; the gentle <lb/>
            pleading of Antigone, however, makes them waver ; and the <lb/>
            indignant protest of their suppliant, who asks bitterly if the <lb/>
            well-known fame of Athens for succouring the stranger and <lb/>
            oppressed is, after all, but an idle boast. Of what are they <lb/>
            afraid ? Of a name, forsooth ? Not surely of the man who bears <lb/>
            it, or of any acts of his,—“a man more sinned against than <lb/>
            sinning." " Whatever I have done was done unwittingly ; and <lb/>
            they whom I wronged, had first wronged me,–and that with full <lb/>
            intent." Eventually the Chorus are so far persuaded as to refer <lb/>
            the matter to Theseus, whose coming is immediately expected. <lb/>
            (11. 203-309.)</p>
          <p>Meantime, Ismene arrives, bringing tidings to her father from <lb/>
            Thebes. She tells CEdipus how his two sons have fallen out <lb/>
            about the sovereignty of the land, how Eteocles has refused his <lb/>
            brother a share in the kingdom, and how Polyneices has gone to <lb/>
            Argos, and by a foreign alliance is bent on humbling the young <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            king of Thebes. But oracles have said that the issue of the <lb/>
            struggle rests with CEdipus ; and so Creon will soon arrive, <lb/>
            in order to get possession of his person. The purpose of the <lb/>
            Thebans, however, is not to reinstate their old king in the land, <lb/>
            but to plant him somewhere on their borders, that they may be <lb/>
            masters of his grave after his death ; for the oracle had also said <lb/>
            that his tomb should confer safety on the land, in which it was <lb/>
            situated. " Have either of my sons heard this ? " asks CEdipus. <lb/>
            " Yea, both have heard, and know it well." " They know it, and <lb/>
            yet have done nothing ! God grant, then, their strife may only <lb/>
            end in the death of both of them, each by the others hand ! One <lb/>
            word from them in bygone days might have saved me from <lb/>
            beggary and exile, but they never said it ; 'tis to their sisters I <lb/>
            owe even my daily bread and such poor nurture as I have ; <lb/>
            wherefore let them ask my help in their hour of need and learn <lb/>
            what it is to be refused ; with Theseus and Athens to champion <lb/>
            me, I defy Creon and his Thebans." Thus CEdipus vents his <lb/>
            indignation on his unfilial sons, while promising to confer on <lb/>
            those, who protect him, a boon that shall serve them well for ever. <lb/>
            (11. 310-460.)</p>
          <p>By the advice of the Chorus, who have been struck by what <lb/>
            the sightless stranger has just said, CEdipus proceeds to make <lb/>
            atonement to the Eumenides, as the deities to whom he has first <lb/>
            come as a suppliant. The rites of purification are carefully <lb/>
            described to him by the elders, and Ismene is sent to perform <lb/>
            them for her father, whose blindness and feebleness preclude <lb/>
            him from acting for himself. (11. 461-509.)</p>
          <p>After Ismene's departure, the Chorus can no longer contain <lb/>
            their curiosity, but insist on learning from CEdipus the whole <lb/>
            story of his sad life ; he answers their questions, and once more <lb/>
            protests that he was but an instrument in Fate's hands ; no <lb/>
            moral guilt can be imputed to him. (11. 510-548.)</p>
          <p>At this point Theseus enters. He recognizes Œdipus at once, <lb/>
            and, almost before being asked, assures him of his help. " I was <lb/>
            a stranger once myself; never, then, would I turn aside from such <lb/>
            another. Well I know I am but a man, and my portion in the <lb/>
            morrow is no greater than thine." With such noble words the <lb/>
            king reassures the wanderer, and then asks him what he requires <lb/>
            of Athens. CEdipus replies that he offers his own body as a gift <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            to the land-a gift fraught with no small gain ; at the same time <lb/>
            he warns the generous king, who consents at once to give him <lb/>
            burial in his land, that to do so may involve a quarrel with <lb/>
            Thebes. Theseus is incredulous. " How should bitterness <lb/>
            come between us ?”Who knows ? " replies CEdipus ; " it may <lb/>
            be all sunshine to-day between Thebes and Athens, but time has <lb/>
            much in store." Only let Theseus make good his word, and he <lb/>
            will never repent it. Accordingly CEdipus is received as a <lb/>
            citizen under the protection of Athens and of the people of <lb/>
            Colonus, more especially; and his fears of armed intervention <lb/>
            from Thebes are quieted by the repeated assurances of Theseus. <lb/>
            (11. 549-667.)</p>
          <p>Then follows a beautiful ode, welcoming the stranger to his <lb/>
            new home,--the most famous choral ode, perhaps, in the whole <lb/>
            range of Greek literature,–in which the beauties and glories of <lb/>
            Colonus, the poet's own native place, are lovingly described. <lb/>
            (11. 668-719.)</p>
          <p>The announcement that Creon is actually approaching throws <lb/>
            CEdipus into a state of alarm, nor is he reassured by the cunning <lb/>
            speech, by which Creon endeavours to justify himself and make <lb/>
            a good impression on the Chorus. He first professes deep com­ <lb/>
            passion for his unhappy kinsman, and begs him to return and <lb/>
            hide the family reproach in the seclusion of his native city. But <lb/>
            CEdipus is not to be beguiled by such smooth words. Thebes <lb/>
            and Creon did nothing for him in days gone by ; now they offer <lb/>
            him what he does not ask, and he knows the reason ; it is not to <lb/>
            take him home they come, but to plant him on their borders, <lb/>
            for their own selfish ends. " My curse upon you, one and all!" <lb/>
            he cries, " and now get you gone ! " (11. 720-799.)</p>
          <p>Creon endeavours to argue with him, and, failing in this, <lb/>
            begins to threaten. He now informs CEdipus that Ismene is <lb/>
            already in his power, and at the same time orders his guards to <lb/>
            carry off Antigone also. The elders of Colonus interpose, but <lb/>
            force prevails, and she is hurried away. Next, Creon is on the <lb/>
            point of seizing CEdipus, who has cursed him for his cruelty, <lb/>
            when Theseus hurriedly enters. He has heard cries for help and <lb/>
            demands to know the reason. No sooner has he heard, than he <lb/>
            despatches horsemen to overtake the Theban guards and bring <lb/>
            back the maidens, while he sternly rebukes Creon's overbearing <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            action, and warns him, that, until the maidens are produced <lb/>
            again, there will be no return to Thebes for him. (1L 800-936.)</p>
          <p>Creon first attempts to justify his conduct, arguing that he is <lb/>
            really doing Athens a service in removing a pollution from the <lb/>
            land, and appealing to the wisdom of the council of Areopagus <lb/>
            to confirm his act. Theseus must, of course, act as he thinks <lb/>
            best, adds the crafty speaker, " for though my cause is just, the <lb/>
            lack of aid makes me weak." At this shameless and impudent <lb/>
            utterance, CEdipus can no longer contain himself. In a strain of <lb/>
            passionate vehemence he repels Creon's taunts, defends himself <lb/>
            from his ungenerous accusations, and proves that it is Creon who <lb/>
            ought to be ashamed of himself for publishing the reproach of <lb/>
            his family, far more than the unhappy victim who was but a pas­ <lb/>
            sive instrument in the resistless hands of Fate. Finally he <lb/>
            appeals to the Eumenides to help him and uphold the right. <lb/>
            (11. 937-1003.)</p>
          <p>Theseus cuts short further recriminations by peremptorily <lb/>
            ordering Creon to lead the way in the rescue of the maidens, at <lb/>
            the same time warning him not to expect any assistance from <lb/>
            possible accomplices in Athens. Creon complies with a bad <lb/>
            grace, muttering impotent threats of vengeance hereafter, of <lb/>
            which however Theseus takes little notice. (11. 1004-1043.)</p>
          <p>As Theseus leaves the stage with Creon, the Chorus chant <lb/>
            a short ode, anticipating his speedy victory, and the rescue of the <lb/>
            captives, at the same time offering up prayers to Zeus, Athene, <lb/>
            and Apollo, to come and lend their aid. (11. 1044-1095.)</p>
          <p>Scarcely have they uttered the last words of prayer, when <lb/>
            Theseus is descried, approaching with Ismene and Antigone. <lb/>
            There is a touching meeting between CEdipus and his restored <lb/>
            children, from which Theseus, who is characterized by a delicacy <lb/>
            and nobility in strong contrast to the mean, blustering disposi­ <lb/>
            tion of Creon, is careful to hold aloof, until CEdipus turns to <lb/>
            thank him and ask for some account of the rescue. Theseus <lb/>
            modestly parries the inquiry with the words, " What need that I <lb/>
            should idly boast, when thou wilt learn it from these maidens in <lb/>
            converse?" He then goes on to tell CEdipus that there is a <lb/>
            matter, on which he would like to ask his advice. An unknown <lb/>
            suppliant, claiming kinship with CEdipus, has appeared at the <lb/>
            altar of Poseidon and craves an audience with him. After a few <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            questions, it becomes clear to CEdipus that this is no other than <lb/>
            his son Polyneices, and he refuses to see him, but is eventually <lb/>
            persuaded by Theseus and Antigone to show some reverence <lb/>
            to the god by allowing the suppliant to come before him. <lb/>
            (11. 1096-1210.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus, whilst Polyneices is being summoned, condemn <lb/>
            the folly of all who crave for length of days, instead of being con­ <lb/>
            tent with a modest span of life. " Not to be born is best; and, <lb/>
            next to that, a speedy return to the place whence one came." <lb/>
            The aged sightless wanderer serves to point the moral of their <lb/>
            reflections —" What has long life brought him but length of <lb/>
            sorrow." (11. 1211-1248.)</p>
          <p>Polyneices enters and expresses his penitence at seeing his <lb/>
            father and sisters in such wretched plight; he pleads with <lb/>
            CEdipus to hear his request and not send him away in scorn <lb/>
            without a word ; CEdipus is an exile no less than he ; let them <lb/>
            make common cause against Eteocles, and re-establish them­ <lb/>
            selves at Thebes ; if only his father will join him, victory is <lb/>
            assured ; without him, even life is at stake. At last CEdipus <lb/>
            speaks, but it is only to utter a fearful curse against his son for <lb/>
            his unfilial behaviour in the past, and to contrast it with the <lb/>
            devotion of his two daughters, who have shared all his sufferings. <lb/>
            (11. 1249-1397.)</p>
          <p>Polyneices bemoans his fate, and, after taking a touching fare­ <lb/>
            well of Antigone and receiving her promise to give him burial, he <lb/>
            goes forth to meet his doom. (11. 1398-1446.)</p>
          <p>Scarcely has this sad scene ended, when tnunder is heard ; the <lb/>
            Chorus express their terror, but CEdipus recognizes the sign <lb/>
            of the gods for his approaching end, and sends in haste for <lb/>
            Theseus, that he may render him a just recompense for his <lb/>
            kindness. (11. 1447-1499.)</p>
          <p>Theseus soon arrives, in answer to the urgent summons, and <lb/>
            asks, "What new thing hath now befallen?" CEdipus replies <lb/>
            that the end is nigh, and that Theseus must follow him to <lb/>
            the place appointed, there to learn the dread secret, on which <lb/>
            depends the safety of his land. This secret only Theseus must <lb/>
            know ; at his death let him hand it on to his successor, and so <lb/>
            on to the end of time. Then, with sure steps, the blind man leads <lb/>
            the way, the others following ; there is no longer any outward <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            sign of feebleness or blindness ; without guide or support he <lb/>
            slowly leads them on, and thus mysteriously leaves the scene, to <lb/>
            appear no more. (11. 1500-1555.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus chant a solemn ode of prayer, entreating the <lb/>
            awful powers of the other world to receive the wanderer kindly. <lb/>
            (11. 1556-1578.)</p>
          <p>Presently a messenger arrives to relate the final scene ; how <lb/>
            he went to the appointed place without aid, finding his way un­ <lb/>
            erringly ; of the rites of purification ; of his sad parting with his <lb/>
            daughters ; and of the mysterious voice which called him. Of <lb/>
            the closing scene none, however, but Theseus can tell aught; he <lb/>
            alone was allowed to witness the end ; all the messenger can <lb/>
            say is, that Theseus was shortly afterwards seen alone, " holding <lb/>
            his hand before his face to screen his eyes, as if some dread sight <lb/>
            had appeared, such as none might endure to behold." He him­ <lb/>
            self is evidently deeply impressed by what he has witnessed, and, <lb/>
            as he says, " if to any I seem to speak folly, I would not care to <lb/>
            win belief from those who count me foolish." (11. 1579-1669.)</p>
          <p>Antigone and Ismene now return, and bewail the loss of their <lb/>
            father, and their future fate ; Antigone would fain visit her <lb/>
            father's grave, but Ismene points out that this is impossible ; and <lb/>
            Theseus, entering once more, comforts the maidens ; "'Tis well <lb/>
            with CEdipus, and we must not mourn. As for his tomb, none <lb/>
            may know where he lies buried ; it was his own command." <lb/>
            Antigone begs that she and her sister may be sent to Thebes, in <lb/>
            the hopes of stopping bloodshed between their brothers ; to this <lb/>
            Theseus consents, adding that he will do all in his power to help <lb/>
            them henceforth. And so the Chorus chant the final words of <lb/>
            resignation, " Weep no more, for verily these things stand fast, <lb/>
            whate'er betide."</p><pb n="76"/>

            destined goal, where I should find a seat of august goddesses, <lb/>
            with shelter for the stranger; there was I to end my life of <lb/>
            misery; a source of gain, from having lived with them, to <lb/>
            those who gave me welcome; a curse to those who sent, <lb/>
            nay, drove me forth. And he told me further, there should <lb/>
            come signs of these things, either an earthquake or thunder, <lb/>
            maybe, or lightning sent by Zeus. Now then I know that <lb/>
            it must have been some sure omen from you, that led <lb/>

            passage now from life to death, some end to my career; <lb/>

          <p>And thou, my child, in days gone by, hast come from <lb/>
            Thebes, bringing to thy father, without the race of Cadmus <lb/>
            knowing aught, all oracles pronounced concerning me, and <lb/>
            thou didst set thyself to keep a trusty watch for me, when I <lb/>
            was being driven from the land. And now, once more, <lb/>
            what news hast thou come to bring thy father, Ismene? <lb/>
            What errand sent thee forth from home ? For on no empty <lb/>
            mission art thou come, full well I know, without bringing <lb/>
            me some cause for fear.</p>
          <p>ISM. What sufferings I myself endured, father, in seeking <lb/>
            out thy mode of life and thy abode, I will pass by and leave <lb/>
            unsaid; for I have no desire to feel that anguish twice, by <lb/>
            telling o'er again my troubles. But I have come to show <lb/>
            what evils now surround thy two ill-fated sons.</p>
          <p>At first, they had an eager wish 1 that the throne should <lb/>
            be left to Creon, and the city saved from taint, professing to <lb/>
            regard2 the ancient curse upon the race,-the way that it <lb/>
            bath clung to thy unhappy house. But now, from prompting <lb/>
            of some god, and of their wicked thoughts, an evil rivalry <lb/>
            hath filled their hearts,-thrice hapless pair !-to seize the <lb/>
            rule and kingly power. And he that is the younger born, a <lb/>
            headstrong boy, seeks to rob the first-born, Polyneices, of <lb/>
            the throne, and hath driven him from his father-land. But <lb/>
            he, according to the story current now with us, hath gone, <lb/>
            an exile, unto Argos in the vale, and is taking to himself <lb/>
            new ties of kin and friends to help him in the fight, resolved <lb/>
            that Argos shall full soon possess the land of Thebes with <lb/>
            honour, or exalt her to the skies.</p>
          <p>These are no mere idle words, my father, but terrible <lb/>
            realities; and where the gods will have compassion on thy <lb/>
            woes, I cannot discover. <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒρως</foreign>, Tyrwhitt's correction of MSS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒρις</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Or, "when they considered calmly." </note></p><pb n="90"/>

            care for me enough to save my soul one day ?</p>
          <p>ISM. That is my hope, father, owing to the present oracles.</p>
          <p>OED. What oracles are these ? What hath been foretold, <lb/>
            my child ?</p>
          <p>ISM. That thou, alive or dead, wilt one day be sought by <lb/>
            the men of Thebes, for safety's sake.</p>
          <p>OED. And who could be the better for such an one as I ?</p>
          <p>ISM. Men say the power of Thebes depends on thee.</p>

            man ?</p>
          <p>ISM. Yea, for now the gods are raising thee; before, they <lb/>
            sought thy fall.</p>
          <p>OED. A paltry boon to raise old age, where youth has <lb/>
            had the fall!</p>
          <p>ISM. Further, know that thou wilt soon see Creon here <lb/>
            for this purpose-and that in no long time.</p>
          <p>OED. With what intent, daughter? Explain, I pray.</p>
          <p>ISM. That they may set thee near the land of Cadmus, so <lb/>
            as to have thee in their power, without thy setting foot on <lb/>
            its borders.</p>
          <p>OED. What gain is theirs, if I am laid beyond their gates ?</p>
          <p>ISM. Thy tomb is a danger to them, if ill-luck befall it.</p>
          <p>OED. Why, thus much our own wits could tell, without a <lb/>
            god to help.</p>
          <p>ISM. That is the reason, then, that they would have thee <lb/>
            settled near their land, though not where thou wilt be thy <lb/>
            own master.1</p>
          <p>OED. Will they likewise bury me in Theban soil ?</p>
          <p>ISM. Nay, kinsman's blood, which thou hast shed, forbids <lb/>

          <p>ISM. By reason of thy wrath, when they stand beside thy <lb/>
            tomb.</p>
          <p>OED. From whom hast thou heard the words thou <lb/>
            speakest, child?</p>
          <p>ISM. From the envoys, who came from the altar at <lb/>
            Delphi.</p>
          <p>OED. And hath Phœbus really said this concerning me?</p>
          <p>ISM. So they say, who came from him to the land of <lb/>
            Thebes.</p>
          <p>OED. Hath either of those sons of mine, then, heard this <lb/>
            news ?</p>

          <p>OED. And did they then, unnatural pair, when they had <lb/>
            heard this, set sovereignty before regret for me ?</p>
          <p>ISM. Thy words pain me, but still that is the news I <lb/>
            bring.</p>
          <p>OED. Then may the gods not quench their destined strife, <lb/>
            and may my two sons find that with me rests the issue of this <lb/>
            fray, wherein they are now engaging and lifting spear 'gainst <lb/>
            spear ! Then neither should he, who now holds sceptred <lb/>
            sway, abide; nor should he, who hath left the land, ever <lb/>
            come back again; since they hindered not nor championed <lb/>
            me, when I, their own father, was being thrust forth so <lb/>
            shamefully from my country ; nay, for all they cared, I was <lb/>
            sent thence from hearth and home and publicly proclaimed <lb/>
            an exile.</p>
          <p>Maybe thou'lt say, it was my own wish then, and the city <lb/>
            granted me the boon, as well it might. Not so, I say ; for, <lb/>
            all that fatal day, when my heart was hot within me, when <lb/>
            to die and to be stoned to death was what I most desired, <lb/>
            not one was found to help me towards that wish; but at <lb/>
            last, when my pain was all assuaged and I began to feel that <lb/>
            my wrath had run beyond all bounds in punishing my former <pb n="92"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[L. 440-467"/> <lb/>
            sins,-then it was indeed, and not before, that the city <lb/>
            sought to drive me from the land by force, so late as that ; <lb/>
            and they who had the power to help,-the sons their sire,­ <lb/>
            would not do so; but for want of a little word, they let me <lb/>
            wander forth, an exile and a beggar evermore.</p>
          <p>From these my daughters twain, weak maidens as they <lb/>
            are,-so far as nature doth allow them,—I get my daily bread, <lb/>
            safe shelter in the land, and the succour kinsmen owe; <lb/>
            while they, my sons, have chosen thrones and sceptred sway <lb/>
            and sovereign power instead of their own sire. But they <lb/>
            shall never win an ally here, nor shall this their reign in <lb/>
            Thebes ever bring them gain; that know I well, from hearing <lb/>
            the oracles this maiden brings and from pondering old <lb/>
            prophecies of my own store, which Phoebus hath accomplished <lb/>
            for me now at length. Wherefore let them send Creon to <lb/>
            seek me, and whoso else is mighty in their city; for if ye, <lb/>
            sirs, as well as these 1 dread goddesses who dwell among you, <lb/>
            will champion me, ye shall win a mighty saviour for this <lb/>
            State, but for my foes a scourge.</p>
          <p>CHO. Worthy indeed art thou, CEdipus, of pity, thou and <lb/>
            these maidens; and since thou addest to this plea that thou <lb/>
            canst keep this land secure, I fain would counsel thee for <lb/>
            thy own good.</p>

          <p>CRE. Good sirs, ye noble dwellers in this land, I see that <lb/>
            signs of sudden fear have filled your eyes at my approach; <lb/>
            yet dread me not, nor vent harsh words upon me. For I <lb/>
            am here without a thought of using force, so old I am, and <lb/>
            well assured that I have come to a city as powerful as any <lb/>
            in Hellas. Nay, but at my age 1 I have been sent to urge <lb/>
            your suppliant to go with me to the land of the Cadmeans, <lb/>
            -not by one man's sending, but at the bidding of all our <lb/>
            folk; for kinship laid on me this tie,-to mourn his woes <lb/>
            beyond the city's grief.</p>
          <p>So hear me, and come home, unhappy CEdipus ! With <lb/>
            right the people summon thee, all Cadmus' folk, and I in <lb/>
            chief; as I, in chief,-unless I am the very basest born,­ <lb/>
            feel sorrow for thy woes, old man; seeing thee in thy misery, <lb/>
            a stranger and a wanderer evermore, reft of the means of <lb/>
            life, with one handmaiden's arm whereon to lean, upon thy <lb/>
            way. Ah me! I never thought that she could fall to such <lb/>
            a depth of misery, as now is hers, poor maid ! while ever­ <lb/>
            more she tends thy needs, living a beggar's life, unwedded <lb/>
            at the age ye see, a prey to any comer.</p>
          <p>Ah, woe is me ! and is it not a sad reproach which I have <lb/>
            flung at thee and me and all our race ? Well, but 'tis impos­ <lb/>
            sible to hide what all can see ; wherefore, by thy fathers' gods, <lb/>
            oh ! hear me, CEdipus, and thyself conceal it, by consenting <lb/>
            to return to the home and city of thy fathers, when thou <lb/>
            hast taken a fond farewell of this State, as she deserves; and <lb/>
            yet hath thy native town a stronger claim on thy respect, as <lb/>
            she that was thy nurse of yore.</p>
          <p>OED. 0 thou who darest everything, and from any plea <lb/>
            of right wouldst draw some subtle scheme, why this attempt, <lb/>
            why seek once more to catch me in the snare whose toils <lb/>
            would gall me most? For in the days gone by, when I was <lb/>
            suffering from my own peculiar woes, and banishment had <lb/>
            been my joy, thou wouldst not pleasure my desire; but <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">τηλικόσδ</foreign>' with Brunck. </note> <pb n="104"/>

            when my rage at last had had its fill, and sweet had been <lb/>
            the privacy of home, then wert thou for thrusting me rudely <lb/>
            forth, nor hadst thou then one kindly thought for this rela­ <lb/>
            tionship. And now again, when thou seest that this State <lb/>
            and all the people stand my friends, thou art seeking to <lb/>
            pluck me hence, in soft words couching harsh designs. And <lb/>
            yet what joy is there in this, in kindness forced on us?' It <lb/>
            is as if a man should say thee nay and grudge his aid when <lb/>
            thou wert fain to win thy boon, but after thou hadst all thy <lb/>
            soul's desire, should then offer to give it, when the boon had <lb/>
            lost all grace; wouldst thou not find that pleasure vain? <lb/>
            Yet such are thy own proposals to me, good in word, in <lb/>
            substance ill. To these, too, will I speak, to prove thy <lb/>
            knavishness. Thy object in coming to fetch me was not to <lb/>
            take me home, but to make me dwell hard by you, that so <lb/>
            thy city may escape unharmed from troubles with this land. <lb/>
            That is not for thee; this is,-to have my vengeful spirit <lb/>
            lodged for ever with you in your land;2 and for my sons, <lb/>
            their portion in my realm is even this,-room to die there, <lb/>
            and no more.</p>

            thou? Yea, better far, as I have surer sources whence to <lb/>

            hast come hither with a mouth full of lies, with tongue as <lb/>
            sharp as tempered steel; and yet thy words are like to win <lb/>
            thee more of hurt than saving grace. Nay, get thee gone, <lb/>
            for I know I am not persuading thee of this,3 and leave us <note type="footnote"> 1 This could also mean, " What joy does this give thee, to show me <lb/>

            where justice is practised and law supreme in everything; <lb/>
            and, spite of that, regarding not this land's authorities, but, <lb/>
            forcing an entry, as thou hast, art making spoil of what thou <lb/>
            wilt, and drawing to thy side unwilling followers, deeming <lb/>
            that mine was some city void of men or peopled with a race <lb/>
            of slaves, and I but as a thing of nought.</p>
          <p>Yet 'twas not Thebes that brought thee up to be a <lb/>
            knave ; for it is not her way to rear her sons in lawlessness, <lb/>
            nor would she praise thee if she learnt that thou wert robbing <lb/>
            me of mine, and the gods of their own, by dragging hence <lb/>
            with violence unhappy suppliants. Never would I, if I set <lb/>
            foot in thy own Thebes, drag or seize aught thence, without <lb/>
            the ruler's will, whoe'er he were,—nay, though I had the <lb/>
            justest plea of all; but I should know how it became a <lb/>
            stranger to conduct himself amongst citizens. Whereas <lb/>
            thou art bringing shame on a city that deserves it not, even <lb/>
            on thine own, and, in thy case, increase of years is bringing <lb/>
            age and senselessness together.</p>
          <p>So have I said it already, and I repeat it now; let some <lb/>
            one bring the maidens hither with all speed, unless thou <lb/>
            wouldst take up thine abode in this land by force, and not <lb/>
            of thy free will; and what I tell thee, I intend, as truly as it <lb/>
            leaves my lips.</p>
          <p>CHO. Stranger, dost thou see at what a pass thou art? <lb/>
            For thou, though deemed to come of honest stock, art <lb/>
            found to be an evil-doer.</p>
          <p>CRE. It is not that I count this city void of men, or ill- <lb/>
            advised, as thou sayest, son of Ægeus, that I have carried. <pb n="111"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 941-979]"/> <lb/>
            through this deed ; but because her sons, I thought, would <lb/>
            ne'er be filled with so much zeal for kin of mine as to under­ <lb/>
            take their charge in my despite. And I was sure they would <lb/>
            not receive a man with unclean hands, a parricide, one with <lb/>
            whom was found the unholy marriage of a mother with her <lb/>
            child.1 So wise a council, set on Ares' hill, I knew they <lb/>
            had established in their land, which suffers not such wan­ <lb/>
            derers to dwell amongst its citizens. Herein I trusted, when <lb/>
            I would secure this prey. And yet had I ne'er attempted <lb/>
            this, unless he had been calling down on me and on my <lb/>
            race his bitter curse; but for that wrong suffered I deemed <lb/>
            this but a fair revenge. For wrath has no old age, save <lb/>
            death alone; the dead feel not the touch of grief. There­ <lb/>
            fore work thy will; for, though the words I speak are just, <lb/>
            my loneliness yet makes me weak; but, old as I am, I still <lb/>
            will try to pay back deed with deed.</p>
          <p>OED. 0 shameless spirit! whom dost thou think to insult <lb/>
            hereby,-an old man like me, or thine own self? Thou that, <lb/>
            to wound me, hast suffered to pass thy lips all the tale of <lb/>
            murder, incest, and misfortune, which I, poor wretch, en­ <lb/>
            dured perforce ; for so it pleased the gods,—wroth, maybe, <lb/>
            with my race for something in the past. For, taken by my­ <lb/>
            self, thou couldst not find one sin to reproach me with, in <lb/>
            retribution whereof I came to sin on this wise against myself <lb/>
            and mine. Come, tell me this: if to my father God's oracles <lb/>
            were bringing a message to say that he should die by his <lb/>
            childrens' hands, how couldst thou fairly reproach me there­ <lb/>
            with, who was not yet begotten or conceived, but was then <lb/>
            unborn ? And if, again, when born, poor wretch, as I was <lb/>
            born, I met my father hand to hand and slew him, knowing <lb/>
            nought of what I did or unto whom I did it, how couldst' <lb/>
            thou fairly blame the deed I did not choose ?</p>
          <p>And of that marriage with my mother, own sister to thee <lb/>
            as she was, art not ashamed, 0 reckless man, to wring from <note type="footnote"> 1 Others understand "a marriage unholy in respect of its offspring." </note> <pb n="112"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[L. 980-1015"/> <lb/>
            me what I will say anon,-for be silent I never will, when <lb/>
            though hast gone to such impious lengths of speech. 'Tis <lb/>
            true ; she was my mother,—my mother, yes, ah me !-but <lb/>
            neither of us knew it,-and, mother of me though she was, <lb/>
            she bare me children to her shame. But of one thing at <lb/>
            least am I sure,—'tis of thy choice that thou thus speakest <lb/>
            ill of me and her; and yet I did not wed her of my own free <lb/>
            choice, nor speak I thus of choice. Nay, it is not in this <lb/>
            marriage I shall win an evil name, nor in that slaying of my <lb/>
            father which thou art ever flinging in my teeth with bitter <lb/>
            taun<foreign xml:lang="grc">̈</foreign>ts. For answer me but one of all questions. Suppose <lb/>
            upon the spot, and now, appeared some man who tried to <lb/>
            slay thy righteous self, wouldst thou inquire if he who <lb/>
            sought thy blood was sire to thee, or wouldst thou straight­ <lb/>
            way make him pay the price ? Methinks that, as thy life is <lb/>
            dear, thou wouldst avenge thee on thy guilty foe, nor look <lb/>
            about to justify the act. And yet this was the very sea of <lb/>
            sorrow I embarked upon through Heaven's guidance; and, <lb/>
            could my father come to life again, he would not gainsay me <lb/>
            in this, I trow. But thou, who art no honest man, but <lb/>
            thinkest it fair to utter all,-alike what should and what <lb/>
            should not be said,—dost fling such taunts as these at me, in <lb/>
            presence of yon strangers. It suits thee well to fawn on <lb/>
            far-famed Theseus, and on Athens as a nobly-ordered state ! <lb/>
            And yet, with all this lavish praise, it doth escape thy <lb/>
            memory, that if there is a land which knows how to give <lb/>
            the gods their due and reverent worship, this land excels <lb/>
            therein ; yet this is the land whence thou wert for seizing <lb/>
            me by stealth,-an old man and a suppliant,-after carry­ <lb/>

            to my aid and champion me, that thou mayest understand <lb/>
            what men they be who guard this State.</p>

            them hath proceeded from thee and no other; 'twas thou <lb/>
            who didst rescue them, and no man else. Wherefore may <lb/>
            Heaven reward thee as I wish, thyself and this land ! For <lb/>
            amongst you beyond all other men have I found the fear of <lb/>
            God and equity and hatred of, a lie. These things I know, <lb/>

            hand, 0 king, I pray, for me to touch, and let me kiss thee, <lb/>
            if I may, upon the face. And yet what am I saying ? How <lb/>
            should I, unhappy wretch, wish thee to touch a man,3 who <lb/>
            harboureth the taint of every ill? Nay, I'll not touch thee, <lb/>
            nor yet allow this thing in thee. Only they of mortal men <lb/>

            proof: in all that I swore to thee, old man, have I proved <lb/>

            Which promise, sirs, I fain would see made good by you, <lb/>

          <p>Now, father, will I tell thee the reason of my coming. I <lb/>
            have been driven forth into exile from my country, because, <lb/>
            as thine elder son, I claimed to take my seat on thy sove­ <lb/>
            reign throne. This was why Eteocles, albeit the younger, <lb/>
            thrust me from the land; not that he had prevailed in argu­ <lb/>
            ment or resorted to the test of actual might, but he per­ <lb/>
            suaded the city. Now I hold it most likely that the fiend, <lb/>
            who pursues thee, is the cause of this; further, this is what <lb/>
            the prophets also tell me. For, when I came to Dorian Argos, <lb/>
            I took to wife the daughter of Adrastus, and bound by <lb/>
            an oath to myself all that were foremost in renown and most <lb/>
            esteemed as warriors in Apia's 2 land, that with them I might <lb/>
            gather the sevenfold host of spears to march to Thebes, and <lb/>
            either die in justest cause, or cast the authors of this villainy <lb/>
            forth from the land. Enough of that ! Why have I now <lb/>
            come hither? With suppliant prayers I come to thee, father, <lb/>
            —my own prayers and the prayers of my allies, who now on <lb/>

          <p>MES. That is just the very point which merits wonder­ <lb/>
            ment. For thou knowest thyself, I deem, how he went from <lb/>
            hence, since thou wert present;—no friend had he to guide <lb/>
            him on his way, but was himself the guide to all of us. <lb/>
            Now when he reached the threshold steep, fast rooted to <lb/>
            the earth with steps of brass, he stopped at one of the many <lb/>
            branching ways, near the hollowed basin, where are set <lb/>
            the tokens, ever sure, of the covenant 'twixt Theseus and <lb/>
            Peirithous. Midway from this2 and the Thorician stone, <lb/>
            between the hollow wilding pear and the stone-built tomb, <lb/>
            he stopped and sate him down, then loosed his squalid <lb/>
            dress. Next he called to his children, bidding them bring <lb/>
            water from some spring for him to wash and pour libation. <lb/>
            So they went, the pair of them, to the hill, which was in <lb/>
            sight,—Demeter's hill, who makes the young plants green,­ <lb/>
            and quickly brought their father that which he had bidden ; <lb/>
            then washed and dressed him, all as usage bids. Anon, <lb/>
            when he was satisfied with everything being done,3 and <lb/>
            nought that he desired was any longer left unheeded, it <lb/>

            at the sound, and they fell at their father's knees and wept, <lb/>
            and ceased not beating on their breasts and wailing loud <lb/>
            and long. No sooner did he hear their bitter cry, than he <lb/>
            folded his arms around them, saying: " My children, to-day <lb/>
            are ye left fatherless; for all that was mine is death's <lb/>
            henceforth; no more shall ye have the bitter task of tend­ <lb/>

            a single word, atones for all that sum of pain,-love, which <lb/>
            ye have had from me surpassing any other man's; but <lb/>
            now ye are to lose me, for all the remnant of your life <lb/>
            henceforth."</p>
          <p>Thus clung they each to other, sobbing and weeping the <lb/>
            while, all three of them. But when they had ended their <lb/>
            lament, and the sound thereof uprose no more, there was <lb/>
            silence; when suddenly pealed forth a voice of one that <lb/>
            summoned him, so that the hair of all did stand on end, in <lb/>
            sudden wild affright; for a god called him, calling oft in <lb/>
            divers ways :1 " CEdipus, O CEdipus, why do we delay our <lb/>
            going? Too long already has thy lingering been."</p>
          <p>Now when he knew it was a god who summoned him, he <lb/>
            bade king Theseus draw near him ; and when he was come, <lb/>
            he said: " Kind friend, I pray thee give thy hand to my <lb/>
            children, the time-honoured pledge,-and you, my daughters, <lb/>
            give your hands to him ;-and promise that thou wilt never <lb/>
            willingly forsake them, but ever wilt do all that thou art <lb/>
            minded, with kind intent and for their good." And Theseus, <lb/>
            like a noble man, uttering no lament,3 promised with an <lb/>
            oath to do the stranger's bests. <note type="footnote"> 1Hermann and Lehrs condemn this line. </note><note type="footnote"> a The traditional reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαίαν</foreign>,is, perhaps, best explained thus. <lb/>

          <p>At once, when he had made an end, (Edipus thus spake, <lb/>
            feeling for his daughters with his sightless hands: " My <lb/>
            children, ye must keep brave hearts and go from hence, nor <lb/>
            claim to see forbidden sights or hear forbidden speech. <lb/>
            Depart, make no delay; only let Theseus, whom it most <lb/>
            concerns, be present to witness what happens."</p>
          <p>So far we heard him, one and all; then, while our tears <lb/>
            flowed thick and fast, we followed the maidens' steps; but <lb/>
            after we had gone from him, we turned our heads ere long, <lb/>
            but no longer could we see him anywhere; only the king <lb/>
            we saw, holding his hand before his face to shade his eyes, <lb/>
            as if there had appeared to him some dreadful sight, too <lb/>
            awful to behold. A little while, and then we saw the king <lb/>
            making obeisance to the earth and to Olympus, home <lb/>
            of gods, at once and in the self-same prayer. But by <lb/>
            what doom that other passed from life, no mortal man <lb/>
            can tell, save Theseus only. 'Twas not God's fiery thunder­ <lb/>
            bolt nor any tempest sweeping in that hour from off the <lb/>
            sea, that caused his end; but either there came to him <lb/>

            where the dead have rest and sorrow is no more,1 were <lb/>
            opened in love to receive him. For not with tears nor in <lb/>
            sickness and suffering was yonder man sent hence, but in <lb/>
            wondrous wise, if ever mortal was. And if my words seem <lb/>

            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE scene of the play is laid before the royal palace at Thebes, <lb/>
            where Creon is now king after the death of CEdipus and his sons, <lb/>
            Polyneices and Eteocles, who had disagreed as to their respective <lb/>
            rights,—Eteocles claiming the sole sovereignty and refusing his <lb/>
            brother a share ; whereupon Polyneices, who had meantime <lb/>
            allied himself with Argos, by marrying the king's daughter, <lb/>
            brings an army, led by himself and six other chieftains, against <lb/>
            his native city. In the battle, which follows, the brothers fall by <lb/>
            each other's hands, and the Argive host, losing its other leaders <lb/>
            also, decamps in haste and fear by night.</p>
          <p>It is on the very day succeeding these momentous events that <lb/>
            the play opens. Creon, the new monarch, has issued an inhuman <lb/>
            decree, that no one, on penalty of death, shall honour Polyneices, <lb/>
            the enemy and traitor to his country, with the rites of burial. His <lb/>
            body is to lie, where it fell, a prey for dogs and carrion birds ; <lb/>
            Eteocles, on the other hand, receives all honour, as the champion <lb/>
            of Thebes, who has died in her defence.</p>
          <p>It is still early dawn, when Antigone appears before the <lb/>
            palace in earnest conversation with her sister Ismene, whom she <lb/>
            informs of Creon's decree, and invites her aid in setting it at de­ <lb/>
            fiance by burying her brother. Ismene endeavours to dissuade <lb/>
            her from the rash attempt, pointing out that such disobedience <lb/>
            will only entail fresh suffering for them both,-and surely they <lb/>
            have seen enough of that in their family already; let her re­ <lb/>
            member her sex ; women must not strive with men, or subjects <lb/>
            with their rulers ; and, lastly, the dead will pardon them under <lb/>
            the circumstances. But Antigone rejects these timid counsels <lb/>
            with scorn : she feels she owes a higher duty to her dead brother <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            than to the self-willed tyrant; let Ismene go her own way and <lb/>
            consult her safety ; sIte, at any rate, has resolved to do the deed, <lb/>
            come what may. Thus the sisters part; Antigone filled with <lb/>
            heroic fortitude, Ismene with weak misgivings for the issue. <lb/>
            (11. 1-99.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus, composed of fifteen aged Thebans, then sing an <lb/>
            ode of thanksgiving, commemorating the dangers from which <lb/>
            their city has just escaped ; while at the same time they ask each <lb/>
            other, why Creon has specially convened them now. (11. 100-162.)</p>
          <p>Creon, on entering, explains at some length his views of <lb/>
            government; he will ever honour the just and punish the unjust; <lb/>
            and then reiterates his decree respecting Eteocles and Polyneices. <lb/>
            To this the Chorus give a doubting assent, more because he is <lb/>
            their ruler than because they feel that he is right in his resolve. <lb/>
            (11. 163-222.)</p>
          <p>As they are still conversing, a guard enters, with the news that <lb/>
            some one has given burial to the corpse of Polyneices ; no man <lb/>
            saw who did the deed, and there is nothing to lead to the detec­ <lb/>
            tion of the doer. The man endeavours to excuse himself from all <lb/>
            blame, and the Chorus even suggest that the gods may have had <lb/>
            a <unclear>and</unclear> in this mysterious burial. Not so Creon ; he is furious ; <lb/>
            is it lik ely, he asks, that the gods would so honour a man, who <lb/>
            sought to overthrow their shrines and ruin his country? No! <lb/>
            there were from the first some in the town who murmured at his <lb/>
            rule, and this n , their doing ; but they shall rue it bitterly ; and <lb/>
            so, too, he as, awful threats, shall the guards, unless they <lb/>
            speedily d iscover ,culprits. (11. 223-331.)</p>
          <p>In an ode of skiller beauty and power the Chorus dwell upon <lb/>
            the all-inventive skiller man; nothing is too hard for him,­ <lb/>
            death only excep f qall else he finds out away ; and yet his <lb/>
            cunning as oten brings(to evil as to good ; from all evil- <lb/>
            doers Heaven keep us . <lb/>
            sudden entrance o, 33375-)</p>
          <p>The calls forth an exprethe guard, with Antigone in close <lb/>
            custody, not lessened, when ssion of surprise from the Chorus, <lb/>
            which <lb/>
            the corpse. Creon interrogate is accused of being the burier of <lb/>
            in detail Antigone was the guard, who then describes <lb/>
            funeral honours to 1 caught, red-handed, in the act <lb/>
            by Cre brother. (11. 376-440) <lb/>
            of paying being questioned 1 , Antigone offers no denial, and <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            in a speech, which will ever take immortal rank amongst all con­ <lb/>
            fessions of a pure and noble faith, she boldly appeals to those un­ <lb/>
            written laws of Heaven, which are above all human ordinances. <lb/>
            And, as for death, she scorns it; or rather welcomes such an es­ <lb/>
            cape from a life of misery. (11. 441-470.)</p>
          <p>Naturally, the haughty, self-willed tyrant is not disposed to <lb/>
            give way to this free-spoken girl. She shall be punished, and <lb/>
            her sister too. Antigone makes no attempt to conciliate her en­ <lb/>
            raged uncle ; let him kill her, if he will ; she has done her duty <lb/>
            to her brother, and perhaps in the world below a different view <lb/>
            will be taken of her deed. (11. 471-525.)</p>
          <p>Meantime Ismene is led in. Creon accuses her of complicity <lb/>
            in her sister's crime ; she is willing to be thought guilty, if her <lb/>
            sister will permit it; but Antigone refuses to let her have any <lb/>
            share now in the noble deed ; she hung back before, and now her <lb/>
            best course will be to consult her own safety, as she did then. <lb/>
            Ismene and the Chorus then appeal to Creon to spare Antigone, <lb/>
            as the betrothed of Hæmon, his. own son ; but he is obdurate, <lb/>
            and orders the prisoners to be removed and kept in close con­ <lb/>
            finement. (11. 526-581.)</p>
          <p>Creon's determination to doom both sisters to death leads the <lb/>
            Chorus to reflect on the awful destiny, which has pursued the <lb/>
            house of Labdacus ; these two children of CEdipus were its last <lb/>
            hope, one ray as it were in the darkness,-and now they too are <lb/>
            to die a violent death, like all their race. Truly the curse goes <lb/>
            on for ever; none escapes, where it has once fallen. (11. 582-625.)</p>
          <p>These musings are cut short by the entrance of Hæmon. <lb/>
            With studied calmness he answers his father's questions; in all <lb/>
            things he is subject to his father's will; there is nothing he desires <lb/>
            more than his father's success. Thus he attempts to mollify the <lb/>
            king's bitterness, listening, with due submission, to Creon's long <lb/>
            tirade on the evils of disobedience, which he is firmly resolved to <lb/>
            put down, at all costs, as a serious danger to the State. (11. 626- <lb/>
            680.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus admit the wisdom of their monarch's remarks. <lb/>
            Hereupon Hæmon hints to his father the danger he is running <lb/>
            by disregarding the secret murmurings of his subjects, who resent <lb/>
            the harsh punishment of Antigone, though they dare not openly <lb/>
            say so. Again, his father may be mistaken in his severity ; the <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            wisest are sometimes wrong ; no man should be ashamed of <lb/>
            learning from others (11. 681-723). But neither Hæmon's skilful <lb/>
            pleading nor the timid advice of the Chorus have any influence <lb/>
            with Creon. What! is he, at his age, to be dictated to by a <lb/>
            mere stripling ?</p>
          <p>Hæmon, having failed in his attempt to win his father by calm <lb/>
            argument, no longer moderates his language, and hard words <lb/>
            pass between father and son ; Creon so far loses his self-control <lb/>
            as to threaten to kill Antigone before Hæmon's eyes ; whereupon <lb/>
            the latter rushes from the stage, exclaiming that Creon shall see <lb/>
            his face no more.</p>
          <p>The Chorus express their misgivings ; but Creon disregards <lb/>
            their warning, although he goes so far as to remit the sentence <lb/>
            on Ismene, whose innocence has been established in the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding scene. As for Antigone, she shall be buried alive, with <lb/>
            just so much food as will avert pollution from the State. <lb/>
            (11. 724-780.)</p>
          <p>A short choral ode on the irresistible power of Love brings <lb/>
            into prominence the motive, which had prompted Hæmon <lb/>
            to brave his father's anger. He may have acted wrongly, but <lb/>
            Aphrodite is a goddess none may cope with. (11. 781-799.)</p>
          <p>The piteous spectacle of Antigone on her way to her living <lb/>
            tomb, moves even these unemotional elders to tears ; but the <lb/>
            only consolation they can offer is to remind her of the fame that <lb/>
            will follow her after death. No other mortal has ever passed to <lb/>
            Hades thus. It is something for a woman to share a fate, <lb/>
            hitherto reserved for those of god-like race ; and, after all, who <lb/>
            is to blame but herself? Her own self-will has proved her <lb/>
            ruin.</p>
          <p>Thus the Chorus answer Antigone's laments ; until Creon <lb/>
            peremptorily orders his decree to be carried out, without any <lb/>
            further delay ; and Antigone is led away, expressing a belief <lb/>
            that there will be a happy reunion for her with her loved ones <lb/>
            beyond the grave, and vindicating her conduct to the last. <lb/>
            (11. 800-943.)</p>
          <p>The sad fate of Antigone, now passing to her doom, reminds <lb/>
            the Chorus of the fate of some other royal sufferers, and they <lb/>
            recount the cruel punishments meted out to Danae, Lycurgus, <lb/>
            and Cleopatra, who were all of royal descent. (11. 944-987.)</p><pb n="149"/>
            
          <p>As they are ending their choral chant, Teiresias, the blind <lb/>
            prophet of Thebes, is led in by a boy. To Creon's inquiries, the <lb/>
            prophet answers with words of solemn warning : there is danger <lb/>
            threatening the city ; the gods will not vouchsafe their seer any <lb/>
            answer to his auguries or burnt-sacrifice; and it is Creon, who <lb/>
            is to blame for this ; the gods are wroth at the pollution of their <lb/>
            altars by carrion birds and dogs, which have torn the corpse of <lb/>
            Polyneices and brought their prey on to hallowed ground ; let <lb/>
            Creon relent in time ; pride goeth before destruction; it is for <lb/>
            his king's good the prophet speaks. (11. 988-1032.)</p>
          <p>At these stern words the tyrant's rage breaks out again. Is <lb/>
            he to become as merchandise in the hands of a pack of pro­ <lb/>
            phets? Teiresias has been bribed by the malcontents in Thebes, <lb/>
            and sent to frighten his master into compliance with their <lb/>
            wishes ; but they shall never succeed ; no ! not though the <lb/>
            eagles bear their carrion meal even to the throne of Zeus ; and <lb/>
            let Teiresias beware how he prostitutes his art for lucre's sake. <lb/>
            (11. 1033-1047.)</p>
          <p>Teiresias, in turn, warns the king to beware of evil counsel; <lb/>
            and at last, stung to retaliate by the unworthy accusations <lb/>
            brought against him, he pronounces on the blinded monarch <lb/>
            the doom which is overhanging him. " Yet a little while, and <lb/>
            Creon shall hear the voice of lamentation in his own house for <lb/>
            one of his own flesh and blood ; because he has deprived the <lb/>
            dead of rites due to them, and set himself above a higher than <lb/>
            earthly justice." (11. 1048-1090.)</p>
          <p>With these terrible predictions the old seer quits the stage in <lb/>
            anger; and the Chorus, realizing to the full the gravity of the <lb/>
            situation, remind the king that the prophet has never proved <lb/>
            false hitherto, and urge immediate compliance. " Let Antigone <lb/>
            be set free at once, and burial given to the dead." Creon, too, <lb/>
            is startled, and consents to yield ; he will go himself and undo <lb/>
            the evil he has begun; his heart misgives him ; he may, after <lb/>
            all, have been in the wrong. (11. 1091-1114.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus, overjoyed at the prospect of a happy ending to <lb/>
            these sad family troubles, break out in a glad hymn, com­ <lb/>
            memorating the worship of the god Dionysus in his favourite <lb/>
            city, Thebes (11. 1115-1154); but their brief joy only serves to <lb/>
            deepen the feelings of sorrow evoked by the news, which a <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            messenger shortly afterwards announces. He tells a tale of <lb/>
            death ; and the living are to blame for it. Hæmon is dead, slain <lb/>
            by his own hand. The prophet's words are already proved true <lb/>
            (11. 1155-1179). As the man is still answering the questions of <lb/>
            the Chorus, Eurydice. the wife of Creon, and the mother of <lb/>
            Hæmon, appears, having overheard the messenger's announce­ <lb/>
            ment. She demands to know more fully what has happened.</p>
          <p>The messenger thereupon describes how he went with his <lb/>
            master to bury Polyneices ; and, this done, how they sought <lb/>
            the tomb in which Anti-one was immured, only to find them­ <lb/>
            selves too late. The maiden had hung herself, while Hæmon <lb/>
            in despair had flung himself upon her body. When Creon saw <lb/>
            the piteous sight, he called to his son to come forth ; but the <lb/>
            boy, mad with rage and sorrow, sprang at his father with drawn <lb/>
            sworn, and, missing him, plunged the steel into his own heart, <lb/>
            and fell in the death-agony by his betrothed. (11. 1180-1243.)</p>
          <p>After she has heard all, Eurydice re-enters the palace without <lb/>
            a word. The messenger and the Chorus bode no good from <lb/>
            this unnatural silence, and the former enters the palace to learn <lb/>
            her intention. (11. 1244-1256.)</p>
          <p>He is still absent, when Creon is seen approaching with at­ <lb/>
            tendants carrying the corpse of Hæmon, and mourning his own <lb/>
            infatuation. (11. 1257-1276.)</p>
          <p>In the midst of the father's agony, the messenger enters a <lb/>
            second time and announces the death of Eurydice. She has <lb/>
            stabbed herself at an altar in the palace ; and, as he is speaking, <lb/>
            the doors of the palace open, and the corpse of the queen is dis­ <lb/>
            closed, for all to see. (11. 1277-1293.)</p>
          <p>Before she died, adds the messenger, pointing to the corpse, <lb/>
            she cursed her guilty husband. Creon's cup is now full. He <lb/>
            implores some friendly hand to end his miserable life ; the guilt <lb/>
            is all his ; he knows it now, too late ; henceforth life is but as <lb/>
            death to him ; would that his last day were come !</p>
          <p>The Chorus counsel resignation. There is no escape for <lb/>
            mortal man from the woe appointed him ; and, with this chill <lb/>
            comfort, his servants support the king from the stage, as the <lb/>
            Chorus chant once more the solemn lesson of the play : " Pride <lb/>
            goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." <lb/>

          <p>ANT. Ismene, sister mine, by blood my own dear twin, of <lb/>
            all the ills that date from CEdipus, dost thou know one, that1 <lb/>
            Zeus doth not fulfil for thee and me, whilst yet we live ? <lb/>
            Nay, nought is there of agony or bane,2 no shame nor out­ <lb/>
            ward slight these eyes have not beheld amongst our mutual <lb/>
            sorrows.</p>
          <p>And now, what is this fresh decree they say yon chief of <lb/>
            ours hath but just issued to all the burgher folk? Dost <lb/>
            know thereof at all ? Hast heard of it ? or art thou not <lb/>
            aware, that mischief of our foes' devising is coming on our <lb/>
            friends ?</p>
          <p>ISM. To me, Antigone, hath come no news of friends, <lb/>
            joyous or sorrowful, since the day that thou and I were reft <lb/>
            of our two brothers, slain both of them the self-same day by <lb/>
            double stroke; and since the Argive host hath fled this night <lb/>
            just past, I know nought further, whether my fortunes are <lb/>

            tidings seething in thy breast.</p>
          <p>ANT. Aye, truly; our brothers twain,-their burial,—hath <lb/>
            not Creon honoured one, the other treated with disdain? <lb/>
            Eteocles, they say, he hath buried 'neath the earth with due <lb/>
            observance1 of right and custom, an honoured guest among <lb/>
            the dead below; but, as for Polyneices, hapless corpse, a <lb/>
            proclamation, so they say, to all our citizens forbids that <lb/>
            any bury him or wail for him. " Leave him," it says, " un­ <lb/>
            wept, without a tomb," a welcome prize for carrion birds, to <lb/>
            gorge their fill, when they look down on him.</p>
          <p>This, I hear, is what our worthy Creon hath proclaimed <lb/>
            for thee and me,—for me, yes, me; and he is coming hither <lb/>
            to proclaim it clearly to such as know not of it, nor deems <lb/>
            he this a matter of small import; but whoso does aught of <lb/>
            what he has forbidden, for him a public death by stoning is <lb/>
            ordained.</p>
          <p>There, thou hast it! and soon wilt thou be showing <lb/>
            whether thou art bravely bred, or a poor scion of a gallant <lb/>
            stock.</p>

            by loosing or tightening the knot ?</p>

            do the deed ?</p>
          <p>ISM. Describe the kind of risk: pray, what is thy intent ?</p>
          <p>ANT. Wilt thou help this feeble arm to lift yon corpse ?</p>
          <p>ISM. What! dost thou mean to bury him, the thing our <lb/>
            city is forbidden ?</p>

          <p>ANT. Well, 'tis no affair of his to keep me from mine own.</p>
          <p>ISM. Ah ! sister mine, consider how our father died, a <lb/>
            scorned and hated outcast, driven, by sins he had himself <lb/>
            detected, to stab both eyes himself with self-directed blow ; <lb/>
            then she that was both mother and wife, a double title, did <lb/>
            outrage on her life with twisted noose; and, thirdly, our <lb/>
            brothers twain, on one day, brought to pass their common <lb/>
            doom by one another's hands, slaying each the other, hap­ <lb/>
            less pair. Now comes our turn; we two left all alone, think <lb/>
            how we shall die, most pitiably of all, if we defy the law and <lb/>
            go beyond what kings decree or can enforce. Nay, this <lb/>
            should be our guiding thought: weak women were we born, <lb/>
            not meant to fight with men ; and next we are the subjects <lb/>
            of a stronger power, to hearken alike herein, aye, and in <lb/>
            things yet harder than these. So I shall yield obedience to <lb/>
            the powers that be, craving forgiveness of the dead, since I <lb/>
            am forced to this; for meddling overmuch shows sense­ <lb/>
            lessness.</p>
          <p>ANT. I will not bid thee do so; nor, if hereafter thou <lb/>
            shouldst feel the wish, should I welcome aid of thine. Nay, <lb/>
            play the part thou thinkest best; but I will bury him; 'twere <lb/>
            good for me to die in doing that. I shall be laid to rest <lb/>
            with him, my loving heart with his, my sin a saintly act; 'tis <lb/>
            longer I must please the dead than those who still are here; <lb/>
            for there shall I find a rest for aye. For thee, if so thou <lb/>
            wilt, show thy contempt for that, which God hath honoured.</p>
          <p>ISM. Dishonour that ! not I; but defy my fellow-citizens <lb/>
            I cannot; 'tis not my nature.</p>
          <p>ANT. Make that thy excuse, but I will go at once to heap <lb/>
            a tomb above a brother very dear to me.</p>
          <p>ISM. Ah me, poor sister ! How I fear on thy account!</p>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[L. 84-118"/>
          <p>ISM. Well, then, at least declare not this thy scheme to <lb/>
            anyone; hide it in secret, and I will do the like.'</p>
          <p>ANT. Oh, denounce it ! Thy silence will make me hate <lb/>
            thee far more, if thou proclaim this not to one and all.</p>
          <p>ISM. A hot heart thine for a chill emprise !</p>
          <p>ANT. Nay, I know that I please those, who have the <lb/>
            greatest claim on me for this.</p>
          <p>ISM. Yes, if thou shouldst have the power as well; but <lb/>
            'tis impossible, thy wish.</p>
          <p>ANT. Well, well; whene'er I can no more, I'll cease at once.</p>
          <p>ISM. Better to leave the impossible untried to start with.</p>
          <p>ANT. Say that, and I shall hate thee, and hateful wilt thou <lb/>
            ever be to the dead, and justly. Leave me and the crooked <lb/>
            counsels I harbour, to suffer this terrible fate; nought that <lb/>
            I shall suffer will be so bad as dying in disgrace.</p>
          <p>ISM. Well, go thy way, if thou art thus resolved; yet be <lb/>
            assured, that though thy going is unwise, thou art to thy <lb/>

            Forth against our land he set, because of the wrangling <lb/>

            pinion snowy white, and, with him, hosts of men in mail, with <lb/>
            plumed helms upon their heads.</p>
          <p>Above our roofs he stayed his course ; with murderous <lb/>

            blood; then went his way or ever he had gorged his jaws with <lb/>
            blood of ours, or flaming brands of pine had seized upon our <lb/>
            coronal of towers; so loud, so grim the battle-din that rose <lb/>
            about his back, a hard tussle for him, who was pitted against <lb/>
            the dragon.1</p>
          <p>For Zeus doth hate exceedingly the vaunts of swelling <lb/>
            lips, and soon as he espied them drawing nigh in mighty <lb/>
            flood, with proud defiant pomp of clanking gold, he <lb/>
            brandished his levin-bolt and smote him who was just <lb/>
            hastening to raise the shout of victory upon our very battle­ <lb/>
            ments.</p>
          <p>One swing, and on the earth he fell,-the earth that beat <lb/>
            him back again; the torch was in his hand; he who, a <lb/>
            moment gone, rioting in mad onset, was belching blasts <lb/>
            of most tempestuous hate against us. But this matter went <lb/>
            otherwise; 3 while upon others the mighty god of war, dealing <lb/>
            his crushing buffets, was meting out to each his doom, a <lb/>
            sturdy champion for us.</p>
          <p>For seven chiefs at seven gates, ranged against an equal <lb/>
            number, left to Zeus, who routs the foe, the tribute of their <lb/>

            same sire and mother, who set against each other their two <lb/>
            victorious spears, and have alike a share in mutual death.</p>
          <p>But since Victory, great and glorious, is come with joy <lb/>

          <p>CRE. Sirs, Heaven hath safely righted the ship of our <lb/>

            sent for you hither by messengers,—you of all my subjects <lb/>

            was guiding our city's course aright, and after his ruin, <lb/>
            I found you still firm and constant in your feelings towards <lb/>

          <p>Such are my laws for increasing this city's greatness; and <lb/>
            of a piece with these is the proclamation I have now made <lb/>
            to the citizens respecting the sons of CEdipus: " Bury <lb/>
            Eteocles," I said, " and o'er his grave pay all those holy <lb/>
            rites, which go down to heroes after death; for he died in <lb/>
            battle for this city, first in all valiancy of arms. But as for <lb/>
            his brother,-that is, Polyneices,—who returned from exile <lb/>
            and would have utterly destroyed with fire the land of his <lb/>
            fathers and the gods of his race,-who would have drunk of <lb/>
            the blood of his kin, and have led the rest of us away <lb/>
            as slaves, let no one honour him with a grave or mourn for <lb/>
            him, but leave him unburied, his corpse a prey to dogs and <lb/>
            kites, outraged thus for all to see." So ran the proclamation <lb/>
            to this city.</p>
          <p>So am I minded; and never, by any deed of mine, shall <lb/>
            knaves take honoured rank before the righteous ; but whoso <lb/>
            is well disposed to this city shall have honour of me alike in <lb/>
            life and death.</p>
          <p>CHO. Such is thy pleasure, Creon, son of Menceceus, <lb/>

            oft ere now been men's ruin from the hopes it raises.</p>
          <p>WAT. I will not say, my king, that I come out of breath <lb/>
            from haste, nimbly stepping out. No ; I had thoughts that <lb/>
            often made me stop, and oft upon the way I turned me round <lb/>
            to beat retreat; for my heart kept up a ceaseless talk with <lb/>
            me, " Poor wretch, why seek a goal, where punishment <lb/>
            awaits thee?" "What! loitering again, thou sorry knave?" <lb/>
            " If Creon learns this from another, wilt thou not rue it, <lb/>
            prithee ? "</p>
          <p>Thus I turned the matter over and went on my way with <lb/>
            slow reluctant steps; 1 and thus my journey, short as it was, <lb/>
            grew long. At last, however, this thought prevailed,-to <lb/>
            come hither and tell thee; and though there be nought in <lb/>
            my story, yet will I tell it; for I come with this hope tightly <lb/>
            grasped, that I shall suffer nought but destiny.</p>
          <p>CRE. What is it causes thee this despondency ?</p>
          <p>IN'AT. First I wish to tell thee my share in the matter: I <lb/>
            did not do the deed nor did I see who did ; so I cannot <lb/>
            fairly come to any harm.</p>
          <p>CRE. A right good aim thou art taking, and cleverly dost <lb/>
            thou fence thyself off from the matter on every side ; thou art <lb/>

          <p>WAT. I am, indeed : dangers cause a man to hesitate <lb/>
            long.</p>
          <p>CRE. Come, tell thy tale at last, and then get thee gone.</p>
          <p>IN'AT. Well then, this is what I have to tell thee. Some <lb/>
            one hath lately buried yonder corpse and gone his way, after <lb/>
            sprinkling thirsty dust upon the skin and performing all the <lb/>
            needful rites.</p>

          <p>WAT. I know not; there was no stroke of pick yonder, <lb/>
            no earth thrown up by mattock, but the ground was hard <lb/>
            and dry, no break therein nor any mark of chariot-wheels; <lb/>
            nay, he, who did the deed, was one who left no trace. And <lb/>
            when the first day-watcher showed it to us, amazement <lb/>
            seized on all to their distress. For the corpse had dis­ <lb/>
            appeared from sight; not buried in a tomb, 'tis true, but <lb/>
            over it was a thin layer of dust, as one might strew, who <lb/>
            would avoid pollution. No signs were there to view of any <lb/>
            savage beast or dog having approached or torn him. Then <lb/>
            was there a muttering of evil words amongst us, guard <lb/>
            reviling guard; and there would have been blows at last, <lb/>
            nor was there any to prevent it; for every one in turn was <lb/>
            the doer, without any being proved so, but each shrunk <lb/>
            from the knowledge of the deed.1 And we were ready even <lb/>
            to take red-hot iron in our hands, to walk through fire, and <lb/>
            to swear by the gods that we had not done it nor were privy <lb/>
            to any man's plan or deed. At last, when nothing came of <lb/>
            our inquiry, one spake whose words made all of us bend our <lb/>
            heads to the ground in terror, for we could not answer him, <lb/>
            nor, if we did his best, saw we our way to a happy issue. <lb/>
            What he said was this : this thing must be reported to thee, <lb/>
            not hidden. And this advice prevailed,—I being the luck­ <lb/>
            less wretch condemned by lot to receive this stroke of luck. <lb/>
            Unwillingly am I here before unwilling hearers,-that I <lb/>
            know; for none welcomes a messenger of evil tidings.</p>
          <p>CHO. Long, 0 king, have I heard the voice within me <lb/>
            debating, whether this deed is haply of Heaven's own <lb/>
            doing.</p>
          <p>CRE. Cease, ere thou e'en fill me with rage by thy <lb/>

            for yonder corpse. Were they bent on burying him, doing <lb/>
            him special honour as a benefactor,-a man that came to <lb/>
            fire their columned fanes, their treasures, and their land, <lb/>
            and scatter law and order to the winds ? or dost thou see <lb/>
            gods honouring the wicked ? It is not so. Nay, but long <lb/>
            ere this even, there were fellows in the town muttering thus <lb/>
            at me in discontent,1 shaking their heads in secret, nor kept <lb/>
            they their necks beneath the yoke, as was right they should, <lb/>
            in such wise as to bear with me.2 'Tis thanks to them, I <lb/>
            know full well, that these men have been led astray by <lb/>
            bribery to do this deed. For no evil like money has ever <lb/>
            grown current amongst mankind; it is this that causes the <lb/>
            sack of towns; this that makes men leave their homes; this <lb/>
            that schools so well men's honest hearts and makes them <lb/>
            swerve to set themselves to deeds of shame; and it hath <lb/>
            shown men how to deal in acts of villainy, and to know all <lb/>
            godlessness.</p>
          <p>Now, as many as have done this deed for pay, have <lb/>
            worked out their own certain doom sooner or later. If Zeus, <lb/>
            that is, still wins his reverence from me, be well assured of <lb/>
            this,-and on my oath I tell it thee ;-unless ye find the <lb/>
            actual author of this burial and display him before mine <lb/>
            eyes, death alone shall not be punishment enough for you, <lb/>
            but first shall ye be hung up alive, till ye have revealed this <lb/>

            we swept away all the dust, which covered the dead, and, <lb/>
            after we had carefully laid bare the clammy corpse, we sat <lb/>
            us down to watch from the hill-top, to windward, taking <lb/>
            good care that the stench therefrom should not reach us,— <lb/>
            each man with wakeful zeal and evil chiding words rousing <lb/>
            his fellow, if any should neglect1 this task. Things went so <lb/>
            awhile, even until the sun's bright orb was stationed in mid <lb/>
            heaven, and the heat was scorching us; and then, on a <lb/>
            sudden, a whirlwind caught up from the ground a squall of <lb/>
            dust, which saddened heaven's face, and filled the plain, <lb/>
            working havoc with all the leafy woods upon it, and the <lb/>
            broad firmament was choked withal; but we shut our eyes, <lb/>
            and so endured the heaven-sent plague.</p>
          <p>And, when it was over at last, the maid was seen, and she <lb/>
            wailed aloud, as it had been the piercing scream of a bird in <lb/>
            her agony, what time she finds the covert of the nest empty, <lb/>
            robbed of her young; so she, too, when she saw the dead <lb/>
            man bare, broke out in wailing cries, invoking bitter curses <lb/>
            on the doers of the deed. And straightway she brings in <lb/>
            her hands the thirsty dust, and then from well-wrought ewer <lb/>
            of bronze, held high, she crowns the corpse with threefold <lb/>
            offerings poured. At once, on seeing this, we rushed and <lb/>
            made her our prize all undismayed; and then we started to <lb/>
            upbraid her with her past and present conduct; but she set <lb/>
            herself to deny nought, causing me both 2 joy and grief. <lb/>
            For most joyous though it be to escape from trouble oneself, <lb/>
            yet is it grievous to bring one's friends thereto. But all <lb/>

          <p>ANT. I knew it; of course I did; it was known to all.</p>

            that proclamation, nor is it that Justice, whose dwelling is <lb/>
            with gods below, which ordained such2 laws amongst man­ <lb/>

            power, that mortal man should be able to go beyond the un­ <lb/>
            written and unswerving laws of Heaven; for these, I trow, <lb/>
            are not to-day's or yesterday's decrees. No ! they live on <lb/>

            e'en though thou hadst issued no decree; and if I am to <lb/>

            made trial of burnt-offerings at the blazing altar; but the fire­ <lb/>
            god would not shine from my sacrifices; instead thereof <lb/>
            a foul clammy moisture kept oozing from the thigh-bones on <lb/>
            to the embers, smoking and sputtering; and the gall was <lb/>
            scattered in the air, and the thighs fell away and were bared <lb/>
            of their layers of fat.</p>
          <p>Thus, as I learnt from this boy, the oracles I sought from <lb/>
            baffled rites had failed; for he is a guide to me, as I to <lb/>
            others. And this sickness of the State is owing to thy pur­ <lb/>
            pose. For our altars and our hearths are tainted, one and <lb/>
            all, by birds and dogs with carrion from yon hapless corpse, <lb/>
            the son of CEdipus. And so it is that the gods no longer <lb/>
            accept from us the prayers we raise at sacrifice, nor the flame <lb/>
            of thigh-bones; and no bird uttereth shrill cries, which may <lb/>
            be interpreted; for they are gorged with the fatness of a dead <lb/>
            man's blood.</p>
          <p>Consider these things, then, my son. To err is the com­ <lb/>
            mon lot of all; but, the error made, he is no longer void of <lb/>
            wit or happiness, who finds a cure, when he hath fallen into <lb/>
            trouble, and becomes not stubborn. Self-will, be sure, incurs <lb/>
            the charge of brute stupidity. Nay, but relent towards the <lb/>
            dead; stab not a fallen foe; what valour is it to kill the <lb/>
            slain a second time ? Good were the thoughts of my heart <lb/>
            to thee, and good are now my words; and most sweet it <lb/>
            is to learn of one who speaketh well, if he speak to thy <lb/>

            to pass, it seems !</p>
          <p>MES. Since things are even thus, it rests with you to de­ <lb/>
            cide for what remains.</p>
          <p>CHO. Lo ! I see unhappy Eurydice, the wife of Creon, <lb/>
            close to us; she hath heard about her son, or it may be <lb/>
            chance that brings her here from the palace.</p>
          <p>EUR. Fellow-townsfolk, one and all, I heard what ye said, <lb/>
            as I was on my way forth to the door to address my prayers <lb/>
            to the goddess Pallas. And I was just loosing the bolts of <lb/>
            the gate, to open it,2 when there smote on my ear the <lb/>
            message of a sorrow, all my own. Terror-struck I sunk <lb/>
            backwards into my handmaids' arms, and lost all con­ <lb/>
            sciousness.</p>
          <p>But tell me once more, what the tidings were; for it will <lb/>
            not be as one new to sorrow that I shall hear them.</p>
          <p>MES. Beloved mistress, I will speak, eye-witness as I was, <lb/>
            omitting not one word of the truth. For why should I seek <lb/>
            to soothe thee, in a case where I shall afterwards be proved <lb/>
            a liar ? The truth is always the safe course. I had gone <lb/>
            with thy lord to guide him to the far end of the plain, where <lb/>
            lay the corpse of Polyneices, unpitied still and torn by dogs. <lb/>
            Then, when we had prayed to her who haunts the roads,3 <lb/>
            and to Pluto, to stay their anger and be gracious, we washed <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. of Antigone. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Taking <foreign xml:lang="grc">άνασπαστού</foreign> proleptically, " so that it might be opened.'' <lb/>
            Others render, " loosing the bars of the gate which were drawn back," <lb/>
            supposing the case of the adjective to be due to hypallage. A third <lb/>
            view seems possible : the doors of the ancients, in some cases at any <lb/>
            rate, opened outwards. Could not then a door be said to be pulled <lb/>
            back or pulled to, when closed from the inside ? </note><note type="footnote"> 3 i.e. the goddess Hecate. </note> <pb n="193"/>

            yon corpse with holy washing, and set to burn the little <lb/>
            there was left, in folds of branches freshly plucked; and, <lb/>
            after we had heaped a towering mound of his own dear soil <lb/>
            above him, we started next to enter the stone-paved vault, <lb/>
            Death's bridal-chamber for the maid. While still far from <lb/>
            it, some one heard a voice of loud wailing about the cham­ <lb/>
            ber all unhonoured, and he came and informed his master, <lb/>
            Creon ; and, as the king drew nearer yet and nearer, vague <lb/>
            sounds of piteous crying rang about him; then, with a moan, <lb/>
            he uttered words of deep distress : " Ah, woe is me ! and am <lb/>
            I a prophet ? Am I advancing on a way more fraught with <lb/>
            grief than any in the past ? It is my son's voice greets my <lb/>
            ear. 0 haste, my servants, draw nearer, and when ye are <lb/>
            at the tomb, enter the opening in the mound, whence the <lb/>
            stones have been torn,1 to the very mouth thereof, and look <lb/>
            well if 'tis Hæmon, whose voice I hear, or if I am Heaven's <lb/>
            dupe."-</p>
          <p>So, earnestly we set to look, at the bidding of our lord, now <lb/>
            faint with fear; and in the furthest corner of the tomb we <lb/>
            saw the maiden hanging by the neck, in a noose of thread <lb/>
            drawn from her own drapery; while Hæmon had thrown <lb/>
            himself beside her, his arms about her waist, and was wail­ <lb/>
            ing the ruin of his marriage with her that was dead, and his <lb/>
            father's deeds, and his luckless bride. Now when our master <lb/>
            saw him, he gave one moan of sorrow, and, rushing in, called <lb/>
            loudly to him with a voice of woe: " Unhappy son, what a <lb/>
            deed is thine ! What was thy intent ? What sad mischance <lb/>
            hath been thy ruin ? Come forth, my child, I do implore <lb/>
            in suppliant tone !"</p>
          <p>But his son glared round on him with savage eyes, a look <lb/>
            of loathing on his face,2 and with never a word of answer, <note type="footnote"> 1 Or, taking <foreign xml:lang="grc">λιθοσπαδή</foreign> proleptically after <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύντες</foreign>, " tear away the <lb/>

            drew his hilted sword, but missed his father, as he sped <lb/>
            forth in flight. Then that luckless youth, angered with <lb/>
            himself, in a moment plunged the blade deep into his side, <lb/>
            leaning on it amain; and, while the life was yet within him, <lb/>
            he clasped the maiden in his drooping arms, and, gasping <lb/>
            hard, he spurts a sudden jet of crimson drops on to her <lb/>
            pallid cheek. So there he lies, dead, with his arms around <lb/>
            the dead. In Hades' halls, at any rate,' hath he found the <lb/>
            marriage rites completed, luckless lover,-a witness he to all <lb/>
            mankind, that heedlessness is by far the greatest evil laid on <lb/>
            man. (EURYDICE hurries from the stage.)</p>

            hath turned and gone without a word, or good or bad.</p>
          <p>MES. Like thee I am amazed ; but I nourish a hope that <lb/>
            she will not deign to lament in public on the news of her <lb/>
            son's sad fate, but beneath her own roof and in her chamber <lb/>
            will impose upon her maidens the mourning of her private <lb/>
            grief; for she is not so unversed in wisdom as to act amiss.</p>
          <p>CHO. I know not; but to me, at least, excessive silence <lb/>
            seems as dangerous a state as wailing much and all in <lb/>
            vain.</p>
          <p>MES. Well, I will go within the palace and learn the <lb/>
            worst, whether she is indeed hiding some stifled scheme in <lb/>
            the secret chamber of her angry heart. Yes, thou art right; <lb/>
            excess of silence may bode mischief too. (The MESSENGER <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE scene of the play is Mycenæ, before the palace of the <lb/>
            Pelopidæ, and the time early morning. " Already the sun <lb/>
            shines bright and wakes the matin songs of birds." Orestes <lb/>
            and Pylades enter with an old and confidential servant, and a <lb/>
            conversation ensues between Orestes and the aged retainer as <lb/>
            to the best means of carrying out the duty imposed upon them <lb/>
            of purging the royal house at Mycenae of its pollution. The <lb/>
            plan eventually agreed upon is that the old man shall first enter <lb/>
            the house and report the death of Orestes, and seize the occasion <lb/>
            to learn how matters stand. To lend colour to these tidings, a <lb/>
            story is to be invented, with circumstantial details, telling how <lb/>
            Orestes was killed by a fall from his chariot at the Pythian <lb/>
            games. After a short interval,- Orestes and Pylades are to <lb/>
            enter bearing a funeral urn, purporting to contain the ashes of <lb/>
            the dead youth. Meantime Apollo's first command must be <lb/>
            obeyed, and due honours paid to the tomb of Agamemnon. <lb/>
            (11. 1-85.)</p>
          <p>As they leave the stage to carry their scheme into effect, <lb/>
            Electra appears alone from the palace, and chants a mournful <lb/>
            dirge on the treacherous fate that overtook her father, and the <lb/>
            unending sorrow that has been her lot since then, and evermore <lb/>
            must be ; ending with an impassioned appeal to all the powers <lb/>
            of vengeance to come and help her by sending Orestes home. <lb/>
            (11. 86-120.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus, consisting of maidens of Mycenae, make their en­ <lb/>
            trance at this point, and endeavour to comfort her violent grief. <lb/>
            " Tears will not bring Agamemnon to life again." " Perhaps <lb/>
            not," rejoins Electra ; " but to weep best suits my mood ; and <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            goddesses have wept their losses too." " Nor art thou the only <lb/>
            sufferer ; Orestes and Chrysothemis have equal cause for <lb/>
            grief." " Orestes, yes-for whom I wait this weary while, ever <lb/>
            wasted with my tears ; for he is ever coming, yet he never <lb/>
            comes." " Courage, daughter ; Zeus is lord in Heaven still; <lb/>
            Time is a god who smooths rough ways ; Orestes has not for­ <lb/>
            gotten,-no ! nor the god who rules by Acheron's wave." " Hope <lb/>
            is dead within me ; friendless and oppressed I lead a weary life, <lb/>
            with the hideous memory of that awful day ever before me. <lb/>
            God grant the murderers such another doom !" " At least <lb/>
            refrain from making thy lot worse by open rebellion, and rash <lb/>
            utterances." " Seek not to comfort me ; I will never cease to <lb/>
            vent my griefs ; how can I forget the dead ?" " Well, we will <lb/>
            cease if our words offend." (11. 121-253.) " I am ashamed," <lb/>
            answers Electra, " of appearing too impatient ; but consider my <lb/>
            position,-forced to live with my father's murderers, dependent <lb/>
            on them even for daily bread, compelled to witness my mother's <lb/>
            indecent joy, and to see the usurper on my father's throne, to <lb/>
            listen daily to my mother's bitter upbraidings, to hear her curse <lb/>
            and wish me dead because I saved Orestes,—though there is <lb/>
            little hope of his ever returning." (11. 254-309.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus next proceed to question Electra as to the <lb/>
            chances of Orestes returning, and she replies that his coming <lb/>
            never goes beyond promises. " Courage," say the Chorus, " he <lb/>
            is noble and will not fail thee." (11. 310-327.)</p>
          <p>The entrance of Chrysothemis cuts short further conversation. <lb/>
            Her attitude to Ægisthusand Clytæmnestra is in marked contrast <lb/>
            to her sister's. She begins by chiding Electra for showing her <lb/>
            resentment so openly ; why can she not hide her feelings and <lb/>
            wait her opportunity ? This advice calls forth from Electra an <lb/>
            indignant rejoinder. What is the use of Chrysothemis pre­ <lb/>
            tending she hates Ægisthus and Clytæmnestra in her heart, <lb/>
            when all the time she is living in comfort and luxury at their <lb/>
            expense ? No, she is only repeating her mother's precepts,­ <lb/>
            apt pupil enough, no doubt I Chrysothemis replies that she is <lb/>
            used to her sister's querulous complaints, and can very well pass <lb/>
            them over; but she warns her, that her continual rebellion has <lb/>
            led her oppressors to form plans for ending these exhibitions of <lb/>
            temper. They intend to imprison her in a sunless dungeon for <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            the rest of her days. " Well," rejoins Electra, " I care not how <lb/>
            soon it comes ; but whither art thou bound with those funeral <lb/>
            offerings?" "To our father's tomb, at the bidding of our <lb/>
            mother." " And why ? " " She had a vision in the night: our <lb/>
            father appeared and planted his sceptre on the hearth, and from <lb/>
            it there grew a fruitful bough which overshadowed the whole <lb/>
            land of Mycenæ." " Throw away those gifts ; it is not right to <lb/>
            offer them at the tomb, and take, instead, the tresses of our hair, <lb/>
            with this poor girdle, and pray to our father's spirit that Orestes <lb/>
            may come and trample on his foes, that so hereafter we may <lb/>
            offer costlier gifts." (11. 328-465.)</p>
          <p>Chrysothemis, consenting, goes forth on her mission, and the <lb/>
            Chorus proceed to analyze the dream of Clytæmnestra. It is. <lb/>
            clearly, they hold, an omen of approaching retribution. Justice <lb/>
            will come ere long ; the avenging spirit of the murdered man is. <lb/>
            abroad ; soon will it spring from its ambush on the guilty pair, <lb/>
            and they shall quake to see it come. Alas for the ancestral <lb/>
            curse upon the house, ever since Pelops slew Myrtilus by <lb/>
            treachery ! Never from that day has bloodshed ceased. (11. 466- <lb/>
            515.) At this point Clytæmnestra enters, and, rebuking Electra. <lb/>
            for being abroad in spite of strict orders to the contrary, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds to justify her own conduct. " True, I slew thy father, but <lb/>
            he brought it on himself by slaying Iphigenia, my daughter. <lb/>
            What right had he to take her life ? It was for Menelaus, I <lb/>
            suppose !"</p>
          <p>Electra, having obtained permission to speak, examines her <lb/>
            mother's specious defence critically, and shows how utterly feeble <lb/>
            it is. In the- first place, Agamemnon was constrained by the <lb/>
            wrath of Latona to sacrifice his child in the place of the stag he <lb/>
            had inadvertently killed ; otherwise the fleet could never have <lb/>
            sailed from Aulis to Troy ; thus he was forced to do the thing he <lb/>
            loathed on public grounds. Even were it otherwise, what pre­ <lb/>
            text would this give a wife to murder her husband ? If any, why <lb/>
            then Clytæmnestra should die on the same showing. Lastly,. <lb/>
            what excuse can there be for the wife of the murdered man <lb/>
            living with the murderer, and treating her children with such <lb/>
            barbarity ? And as for the faults of the daughter,-from whom <lb/>
            were they inherited ? Clytæmnestra should be proud of a child, <lb/>
            who takes after herself!</p><pb n="204"/>
            
          <p>'' Am I to heed a mere child like her,-so shameless too ? " <lb/>
            Shameless, yes, and I blush for it, but shameful deeds will <lb/>
            teach the like."</p>
          <p>With a parting threat, Clytæmnestra proceeds to the sacrifice <lb/>
            which she has come forth to offer. "May Phæbus avert the <lb/>
            omen of the dream, if it be bad, but bring it to pass, if sent for <lb/>
            any good ! Whatever I dare not say in the presence of this <lb/>
            malignant maid, thou, Lyceian god, wilt understand, for all is <lb/>
            open to the sons of Zeus." (11. 516-659.)</p>
          <p>Scarcely has the queen finished her prayer to Phœbus, when <lb/>
            a messenger enters. It is the old retainer disguised ; he is <lb/>
            inquiring for the house of Ægisthus, and, on identifying Clytæm­ <lb/>
            nestra, at once announces that he has been sent by Phanoteus of <lb/>
            Phocis to bring news of the death of Orestes. The sudden <lb/>
            shock almost overpowers Electra, but Clytæmnestra eagerly <lb/>
            bids the messenger tell the whole story ; which he then pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds to do. Orestes had come to the Pythian games, and, <lb/>
            after winning numerous prizes, he entered for the chariot-race <lb/>
            with nine others. At first all went well, and Orestes showed <lb/>
            marked skill in the way he handled his horses, but, in seeking <lb/>
            to take advantage of an accident which befell two other com­ <lb/>
            petitors, he drove too near the turning-post, and was upset. <lb/>
            Before he could be disentangled from the broken car and <lb/>
            tangled reins, his body was battered out of shape, and life was <lb/>
            fled. With pity the Phocians collected his remains and burnt <lb/>
            them on a pyre, and now chosen men are on the way from <lb/>
            Phocis, carrying his ashes in an urn. For a moment, a mother's <lb/>
            feelings prevail with Clytæmnestra. " One cannot learn to hate <lb/>
            the child one bore." But it is only a passing weakness ; why <lb/>
            should she feel any sorrow for the death of so unnatural a son ? <lb/>
            Not so, the messenger's news is good ; henceforth there is <lb/>
            nought to fear ; the only possible avenger is cut off; all will be <lb/>
            peace and calm for the future.</p>
          <p>In strong contrast is Electra's passionate grief; for her, all <lb/>
            hope is swept away, and she must live to hear her mother's <lb/>
            brutal taunts. Nothing is now before her but the life of a slave <lb/>
            in the house of murderers,-but no ! nevermore will she cross <lb/>
            their threshold, but will lie before their doors and waste away <lb/>
            -in tears, or let them kill her if they will. Such are Electra's <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            agonized laments, as Clytæmnestra passes within the palace to <lb/>
            reward the supposed messenger for his welcome news. (11. 660- <lb/>
            822.)</p>
          <p>The cold-blooded remarks of Clytaemnestra elicit a cry of <lb/>
            horror and indignation from the Chorus. " Where can be thy <lb/>
            lightnings, Zeus? Canst thou, 0 Sun-god, see and never <lb/>
            heed?" Electra's grief is inconsolable, and the cold comfort <lb/>
            offered by the Chorus only increases her anguish. " Why tell <lb/>
            me of Amphiaraus ? If he was done to death by a treacherous <lb/>
            wife, yet he found an avenger in his son ; but such can <lb/>
            Agamemnon never find." " To all men death must come."' <lb/>
            " And must it come in such a piteous fashion,-to be trampled to <lb/>
            death by horses' hooves, far from friends in a stranger's land ?"* <lb/>
            (11. 823-870.)</p>
          <p>Chrysothemis suddenly enters, radiant with joy, and out of <lb/>
            breath. " Orestes is returned," she cries. Electra is incredulous. <lb/>
            " Why mock our grief? what proof hast thou?" Chrysothemis. <lb/>
            then relates how she had gone to the tomb of their father, and <lb/>
            had found there traces of fresh libations, wreaths of flowers, and <lb/>
            a lock of hair freshly cut. Who can have done this but Orestes ? <lb/>
            Neither Electra or herself had made the offering, and it certainly <lb/>
            was not Clytaemnestra's work. No, it must have been Orestes <lb/>
            who came and did it.</p>
          <p>"Alas for thy folly ; Orestes is dead, I tell thee," replies the <lb/>
            inconsolable Electra, who cannot believe otherwise after the <lb/>
            circumstantial story of the messenger from Phocis. What <lb/>
            Chrysothemis found must have been placed there by some <lb/>
            sympathizer. One chance is left, and Chrysothemis must loyally <lb/>
            assist. It is this : " We sisters must take the life of the murderer <lb/>
            Ægisthus ; certain it is that, unless we do so, he will keep us <lb/>
            unwedded all our lives, for he has more sense than to run the <lb/>
            risk of letting us raise up avengers of his crime. Yea, and it is <lb/>
            our clear duty to the dead ; and all the world will bear us witness <lb/>
            in the days to come."</p>
          <p>" Sheer madness !" answers Chrysothemis. " Art thou blind ? <lb/>
            Remember thou art but a woman ; success is impossible ; they <lb/>
            are strong and we are weak; we shall only land ourselves in <lb/>
            still worse plight. Be advised, sister ; refrain thine anger, and <lb/>
            never think to battle with the strong."</p><pb n="206"/>
            
          <p>The Chorus support these arguments, but Electra scornfully <lb/>
            rejects such counsel. She is not surprised at her sister's refusal; <lb/>
            it was only what she had expected ; well, she must carry through <lb/>
            the deed herself. Chrysothemis makes one more attempt to <lb/>
            bend her purpose, but, finding it in vain, leaves her with the <lb/>
            words, " By and by thou wilt approve the truth of what I say." <lb/>
            (11. 871-1057.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus, almost as much shocked by the calculating <lb/>
            prudence of Chrysothemis as by the savage exultation of Clytæm­ <lb/>
            nestra, chant an ode expressive of their feelings. " Why do not <lb/>
            men learn piety and affection from the birds of the air? These <lb/>
            are ever true to their natural instincts. Ah, but there will come <lb/>
            a day of reckoning ! Oh that echo would carry the tale to the <lb/>
            dead Atreidae ! The sisters are at variance, and Electra is left <lb/>
            to breast the storm alone. Would she might triumph o'er the <lb/>
            double curse ! For she hath chosen the better part,-duty before <lb/>
            self-interest." (II. 1058-1097.)</p>
          <p>Orestes and Pylades now enter, with attendants bearing an <lb/>
            urn, supposed to contain the ashes of Orestes. They announce <lb/>
            that they are come from Phocis with news for Ægisthus from <lb/>
            Strophius. Electra feels that what she has already heard is now <lb/>
            to be confirmed, and begs them to deliver their message. They <lb/>
            show the urn, and, at Electra's request, hand it over to her, <lb/>
            whereupon she breaks out into a most pathetic lament over her <lb/>
            lost brother.</p>
          <p>"So this is all that is left me now of him I loved the best of <lb/>
            men ! Ah, how different were the hopes with which I sent thee <lb/>
            out! Would I had died or ever I let thee go ! Alas, for all my <lb/>
            nursing long ago ! This, then, is the end ; all I loved are dead ; <lb/>
            alone and friendless am I left; would I might share my brother's <lb/>
            grave!" (II. 1098-1170.)</p>
          <p>" Remember, Electra, we are all mortal," urge the Chorus. <lb/>
            Orestes meantime has been scarcely able to restrain himself, <lb/>
            and he now breaks into expressions of grief at Electra's piteous <lb/>
            plight; she is surprised that any one should notice her sufferings. <lb/>
            " Thou art the first that ever pitied me." " Yes, for I am the first <lb/>
            that ever felt thy grief." " Canst be some unknown kinsman ? " <lb/>
            " Set down that urn, and I will tell thee all." " Do not force me <lb/>
            to do this." " Do as I bid thee, and thou wilt not do amiss."</p><pb n="207"/>
            
          <p>Electra remains still suspicious, until Orestes bids her look at <lb/>
            a signet-ring he carries ; she knows him then, and with one <lb/>
            happy cry of recognition throws herself into his arms. (11. 1171- <lb/>
            1224.)</p>
          <p>Her joy is now as great as her previous grief had been intense, <lb/>
            and she would fain indulge it, but Orestes reminds her that the <lb/>
            danger is still to be faced, and silence is the safer policy; at the <lb/>
            same time he warns her not to let her happy face betray her joy <lb/>
            to Clytæmnestra. After some demur, Electra consents to follow <lb/>
            her brother's counsel, and tells him not to be afraid that she will <lb/>
            betray their secret. " The tears of gladness will still be wet <lb/>
            upon my cheek, and my ancient hate of her sticks deep."</p>
          <p>The Chorus warn them of approaching footsteps, and at this <lb/>
            moment the old retainer, who, till now, has personated a mes­ <lb/>
            senger from Phocis, reappears. He chides them for talking so <lb/>
            much and endangering the safety of their plans, and bids them <lb/>
            enter the palace at once and set about the work in hand. All is <lb/>
            ready, and, with prompt action, success is assured. (11. 1225- <lb/>
            1345.)</p>
          <p>Electra, surprised at the outspoken tone of this aged servitor, <lb/>
            inquires of Orestes who he is ; and from his answer learns that <lb/>
            he is the same trusty retainer, into whose hands she had herself <lb/>
            committed Orestes, when a babe, at the time of Agamemnon's <lb/>
            murder. This is a second joyful surprise, but the old man will <lb/>
            not permit any lengthy expressions of joy. " Time enough to <lb/>
            talk it over, when our present work is done." Orestes and <lb/>
            Pylades then enter the palace, followed by Electra, after she has <lb/>
            offered up a prayer to Apollo for their success. (II. 1346-1383.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus, now strung to an intense pitch of excitement, <lb/>
            chant a short ode. "The avenger is moving onward to his goal; <lb/>
            the swift hounds are already beneath the roof, and the dream of <lb/>
            my heart cannot now be long delayed."</p>
          <p>Electra again comes forth, announcing that the deed is now <lb/>
            being done, and, even as she speaks, the cries of Clytæmnestra <lb/>
            are heard within, while, a moment later, Orestes comes forth <lb/>
            with blood-stained hands, and tells of her death.</p>
          <p>Ægisthus is now seen approaching from a suburb of the city, <lb/>
            and Orestes and Pylades re-enter the palace. (11. 1384-1436.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus advise Electra to speak Ægisthus fair, and so <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            lead him on to his doom ; which advice she follows, when <lb/>
            Ægisthus enters and asks where the Phocian strangers are.</p>
          <p>" Within," replies Electra. " Do they indeed report Orestes <lb/>
            dead?" " More than that, they bring clear proof." " Can I see <lb/>
            it?" "Certainly." (II. 1437-1457.)</p>
          <p>The interior of the palace is then disclosed by a mechanical <lb/>
            stage-contrivance, and a covered corpse is seen, with Orestes <lb/>
            standing near. Ægisthus, after invoking Zeus, orders the face­ <lb/>
            cloth to be removed, but Orestes gravely bids him lift it himself. <lb/>
            Ægisthus, with no suspicion of the hideous truth, draws it aside <lb/>
            and recognizes the features of Clytæmnestra. He is at first <lb/>
            utterly bewildered, but, as the truth flashes across his mind, he <lb/>
            endeavours to obtain a hearing. Orestes, however, cuts him <lb/>
            short, and sternly orders him to enter the house, that he may die <lb/>
            on the self-same spot where Agamemnon bled. Ægisthus, with <lb/>
            one final taunt, obeys, and, as he goes to meet his doom, the <lb/>
            Chorus sum the story up in these few closing words, " 0 seed of <lb/>
            Atreus, how hast thou emerged at last in freedom's light, after <lb/>
            thy long struggle, crowned by the effort of to-day !" (11. 1458- <lb/>
            1510.) <note type="footnote"> NOTE.-For the translation of the " Electra," the text followed <lb/>

          <p>AGED ATT. Son of Agamemnon, leader of the host ere­ <lb/>
            while at Troy, now mayst thou behold, from nigh at hand, <lb/>
            sights thou hast ever longed to see. This is old Argos, for <lb/>
            which thou wouldst yearn,-hallowed precinct of her whom <lb/>
            the gadfly tormented, the daughter of Inachus ; 1 there, <lb/>
            Orestes, is the place of gathering, called from the wolf­ <lb/>
            slaying god Lycean ; 2 and there, upon the left, is Hera's <lb/>
            famous temple; from where we stand, deem that thou art <lb/>
            looking on Mycenae,3 the city stored with gold ; and yonder <lb/>
            stands the house of the Pelopidæ, rife with death,-whence, <lb/>
            in days gone by, after the slaying of thy sire, I bore thee safe <lb/>
            away, from thine own dear sister's hands received, and have <lb/>
            brought thee up till now, even to man's estate, to be the <lb/>
            avenger of thy father's murder.</p>
          <p>Now therefore, Orestes, and Pylades, thou best of friends, <lb/>

            made answer to me on such wise, as thou shalt anon be <lb/>

              from Thessaly; sixth came one from Ætolia, with chestnut <lb/>
              colts; the seventh was a Magnesian ; the eighth an Ænian <lb/>
              by race, with white horses; a ninth from Athens, god-built <lb/>
              town ; a Boeotian as well, making ten chariots in all. And, <lb/>
              having taken stand when 1 the judges appointed had cast <lb/>
              lots and stationed the chariots, they started at the brazen <lb/>
              trumpet's note; at once the drivers shouted to their steeds <lb/>
              and shook the reins in their hands; and all the course was <lb/>
              filled with noise of rattling 2 cars, while dust went up in clouds. <lb/>
              Packed close together, no man spared the goad, that so 3 he <lb/>

              the while, their backs and rolling wheels were bespattered <lb/>
              with foam from the breath of the horses behind. Now Orestes, <lb/>

              Crisa's plain was thick with chariot-wrecks. But he of <lb/>

              were driving neck to neck, first one, and then the other, <lb/>
              showing a head in front of the chariots.1 Safely he steered <lb/>
              his course through all the other rounds, unhappy youth, his <lb/>
              car and he alike erect; till, loosening2 the left rein as the <lb/>

              middle, and forth from the car he slipped and was entangled <lb/>
              in the shapely reins ; and, as he fell upon the ground, away <lb/>
              dashed the horses into the midst of the course. But when <lb/>
              the crowd saw him fallen from his chariot,3 loudly they wailed <lb/>

              loosed him, but so mangled that none of his friends could <lb/>

            slain him, cast him forth, far from our sight, to find the burial <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE story of Heracles finds many different versions at the <lb/>
            hands of ancient writers, and it would be difficult to say which <lb/>
            of these Sophocles followed in the Trachiniæ,-if indeed he fol­ <lb/>
            lowed any one definitely throughout. It is mainly with the <lb/>
            closing scene of the hero's life that the poet is concerned, and <lb/>
            with the events directly leading up to this tragic climax; inci­ <lb/>
            dentally certain facts relative to his past career may be gathered, <lb/>
            often dimly enough, from scattered hints through the play. <lb/>
            Thus, for example, the winning of Deianeira from her suitor <lb/>
            Achelous, the river-god ; the insult offered to the young bride at <lb/>
            the river Evenus by the ferryman, Nessus the Centaur, with its <lb/>
            tragic sequel; the visit to Eurytus at CEchalia in Eubœa, and <lb/>
            the treacherous murder of Iphitus, the son of his host, in revenge <lb/>
            for the father's opposition to the passion of Heracles for his <lb/>
            daughter Iole; the year of bondage to Omphale in Lydia, im­ <lb/>
            posed by Zeus as a punishment for this crime ; the sack of <lb/>
            Œchalia and the capture of Iole ;-these, and a few allusions to <lb/>
            the hero's labours performed for Eurystheus, king of Argos, by <lb/>
            reason of Hera's jealousy of Alcmena's son, must be gathered <lb/>
            here and there from the speeches and choral odes, to serve as an <lb/>
            introduction to the play itself.</p>
          <p>The moment chosen by Sophocles for the opening of the play <lb/>
            is an extremely critical one in the life of Heracles. An oracle <lb/>
            had told him that, after long years of toil and suffering, an end of <lb/>
            all his troubles should come, but what this end was to be was <lb/>
            not further specified. Twelve long years of constant toil have <lb/>
            passed ; each labour has been faced and surmounted ; and only <lb/>
            once has the patient hero adopted unworthy means to secure his <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            end. Baffled rage had led him once into an act of cruel trea­ <lb/>
            chery ; and Zeus, his father, claims the penalty ; so for a twelve- <lb/>
            month more he must toil in shameful servitude to a barbarian <lb/>
            woman ; but the hero has brooded the while over his disgrace, <lb/>
            and no sooner is his year of bondage over than he avenges him­ <lb/>
            self on the ultimate cause of his affliction by sacking CEchalia <lb/>
            and slaying Eurytus with all his race, save Iole, the maiden <lb/>
            whose fatal beauty had first ensnared him.</p>
          <p>Meantime his faithful wife, Deianeira, is waiting and hoping <lb/>
            her lord's return at Trachis, whither Heracles had removed with <lb/>
            his family from Tiryus after the murder of Iphitus, in order to <lb/>
            be under the protection of King Ceyx.</p>
          <p>It is at this point that the play opens. Deianeira, the lonely, <lb/>
            patient wife, is discovered before the house of Heracles at Trachis; <lb/>
            she is reviewing, partly to herself, partly to her old and trusty <lb/>
            nurse, the troubled life she has passed, ever since the eventful <lb/>
            day when her mighty lord saved her from her savage suitor, <lb/>
            Achelous, and made her his own true wife. Toil has succeeded <lb/>
            toil; no respite ever comes to Heracles; no sooner has he <lb/>
            returned than he must start again ; and now he has been absent <lb/>
            full fifteen months, and still no message from him. Some dire <lb/>
            mischance has come upon him. Was this the meaning of that <lb/>
            mysterious tablet he left at his departure ? (11 1-48.)</p>
          <p>Here the old confidential servant ventures to interrupt her <lb/>
            mistress. Why should she not end this cruel supense by sending <lb/>
            one of her many sons in quest of tidings of his father ? Hyllus, <lb/>
            the eldest, might surely go. Scarcely has the nurse spoken, <lb/>
            when Hyllus himself is seen approaching with haste. He has <lb/>
            news of his father ; they say that he is in Eubcea, waging war <lb/>
            on Eurytus. Deianeira then confides to her son her fears <lb/>
            for Heracles,—how that an oracle had said that this would be <lb/>
            the turning-point in the life of Heracles, bringing him death or <lb/>
            rest for evermore. Hyllus at once professes his readiness to <lb/>
            seek his father, and lend him his aid at this crisis. (11. 49-93.)</p>
          <p>As Hyllus quits the stage the Chorus enters ; it is composed <lb/>
            of fifteen young maidens of Trachis, to whom, as to all others <lb/>
            around her, Deianeira has endeared herself by the charm of her <lb/>
            gentle, loving nature ; they begin by invoking the sun-god to <lb/>
            reveal where Heracles now is ; for his wife is wasting away, <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            haunted by sleepless fears on his behalf, as each successive peril <lb/>
            brings him to the very jaws of death. And yet it is not Heaven's <lb/>
            will that man's lot should be free from pain. " Sorrow and joy <lb/>
            come round to all in turn." Zeus will not be careless of his son. <lb/>
            (11. 94-140.)</p>
          <p>" Yes," answers Deianeira, "ye came to sympathize, I know, <lb/>
            but it is not for tender maids like you to understand a depth of <lb/>
            misery like mine,-and never may ye learn it by suffering ! Only <lb/>
            one who has gone through it can fathom the anguish of the lonely <lb/>
            wife." And she goes on to tell them of a greater trouble even than <lb/>
            any heretofore,-how Heracles, the last time he left his home, <lb/>
            solemnly confided to her keeping a certain tablet, and gave her <lb/>
            full instructions about the division of his goods, in case he should <lb/>
            be absent beyond a term of fifteen months. This period has. <lb/>
            expired, and the worst must now be feared. (11. 141-177.)</p>
          <p>At this moment a messenger enters hurriedly with a wreath <lb/>
            upon his head. " Heracles is alive and victorious," he excitedly <lb/>
            proclaims ; " Lichas, his herald, is telling the people his adven­ <lb/>
            tures ; the crowd delays him, or he would have been here ere <lb/>
            now." (11. 178-199.)</p>
          <p>" All praise and thanks to Zeus !" cries Deianeira ; and the <lb/>
            Chorus gladly take up the strain of joy, in which the maidens of <lb/>
            the household also join. (11. 200-222.)</p>
          <p>Lichas is now seen approaching at the head of a band of <lb/>
            captive maidens. Deianeira greets him, and at once inquires of <lb/>
            the welfare of Heracles. " He is alive and well," replies Lichas, <lb/>
            " and will be here anon when he has finished a great sacrifice he <lb/>
            is offering to Zeus in Eubcea for his victory. These are captives, <lb/>
            whom he chose out for himself and the gods after sacking the <lb/>
            town of Eurytus." The herald next describes the cause of his <lb/>
            master's long absence,—how he had been condemned by Zeus <lb/>
            to serve Omphale in Lydia, as a slave, for the treacherous <lb/>
            murder of Iphitus ; to which he was provoked, says Lichas, by <lb/>
            the insolent behaviour of Eurytus. However, old scores are <lb/>
            cancelled now ; Eurytus and all his race are slain, and CEchalia <lb/>
            is enslaved. (11. 223-290.)</p>
          <p>Overjoyed as Deianeira is at the news of her husband's safety, <lb/>
            she is filled with a strange pity for the captives, " once the <lb/>
            daughters, maybe, of free-born sires, but now doomed to the life <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            of slaves." And there is one above the rest, whose beauty and <lb/>
            sadness especially moves her compassion. She questions her, <lb/>
            but receives no answers, and with a native delicacy, which con­ <lb/>
            stitutes one of the chief charms in her perfect womanhood, <lb/>
            I Deianeira does not press the question on the ill-fated girl, but <lb/>
            turns to Lichas for further information. The herald, however, <lb/>
            professes complete ignorance. " I asked not many questions ; <lb/>
            I went through my task in silence." With these words, all are <lb/>
            turning to enter the house, when the messenger begs Deianeira <lb/>
            to tarry a moment; he has something to tell her, which she <lb/>
            ought to know, something for the truth of which he will vouch. <lb/>
            Briefly, then,—Lichas has lied to her. The real reason why <lb/>
            Heracles sacked CEchalia was to win yon beauteous captive, <lb/>
            who is none other than Iole, daughter of Eurytus. " Never <lb/>
            dream, lady, that she comes hither as a slave ; it is not likely, if <lb/>
            his heart is fired with longing !" This was the story Lichas told <lb/>
            the folk ; many heard him, so that he cannot now go back upon <lb/>
            his words. (11. 291-382.)</p>
          <p>Advised by the Chorus, Deianeira adjures Lichas, before his <lb/>
            departure for Eubœa to rejoin his master, to tell her the honest <lb/>
            truth. He tries to prevaricate, but is sharply taken to task by <lb/>
            the blunt messenger, and under the latter's rigid cross-questioning, <lb/>
            and Deianeira's pathetic entreaties, is eventually forced to admit <lb/>
            that he had concealed the literal truth from his mistress, in the <lb/>
            hopes of saving her unnecessary distress of mind. " It is even <lb/>
            as the messenger has said ; it was to win Iole that Heracles <lb/>
            sacked CEchalia ; but pardon me and be kind to her." Deianeira, <lb/>
            by a supreme effort, conceals her emotion, merely bidding Lichas <lb/>
            come into the house with her to receive a gift to carry to <lb/>
            Heracles. (11. 383-496.)</p>
          <p>In the interval between this and her re-appearance, the <lb/>
            Chorus, mindful of the part which Iole seems doomed to play, <lb/>
            sing an ode celebrating the resistless power of Love ; as it has <lb/>
            oft beguiled the gods, so it led to that memorable strife between <lb/>
            Heracles and Achelous for the hand of Deianeira. (11. 497-530.)</p>
          <p>Deianeira now reappears, carrying in her hand a coffer securely <lb/>
            sealed. She has come to tell her youthful friends what she has <lb/>
            devised to regain her husband's affection. No anger against <lb/>
            him prompts her deed ; he has been unfaithful before ; but it is <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            a sickness sent by Heaven, and she can pardon that; but then <lb/>
            comes the haunting fear that a younger, fairer rival may supplant <lb/>
            her, and this she cannot bear. Her aim is solely to win back <lb/>
            her husband's love ; and she can find but one desperate means <lb/>
            to this. Long ago, when Nessus, the Centaur, paid the price <lb/>
            of the insult he offered her at the river Evenus, he gave her, <lb/>
            with his dying breath, a charm to win her lord again, if ever his <lb/>
            affection cooled. It consisted in a portion of the blood which <lb/>
            flowed from the monster's wound, caused by the poisoned shaft * <lb/>
            of Heracles. This she had collected as bidden, and had care­ <lb/>
            fully preserved till now in a secret place, apart from heat of fire <lb/>
            or sun. Now is the time to prove its potency. So she has <lb/>
            anointed a robe with the charm, and is sending it, by the hand <lb/>
            of Lichas, to Heracles, to be worn by him, and him alone, on <lb/>
            the great day of sacrifice, and not before. Fully instructed, and <lb/>
            charged with his mistress's last words, Lichas goes his way with <lb/>
            the coffer. (11. 531-632.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus forget any misgivings they may have felt about <lb/>
            the mysterious charm, and give way to strains of exultant joy, <lb/>
            anticipating the happy day when Heracles will return with <lb/>
            renewed love to his wife's bosom. (11. 633-662.)</p>
          <p>But their joy is short-lived. Deianeira re-enters with news <lb/>
            well calculated to inspire alarm. She has seen something which <lb/>
            has filled her with wild misgivings. A piece of sheep's wool she <lb/>
            had used to smear the charm on her present to Heracles has <lb/>
            crumbled away to powder where she threw it down on the <lb/>
            stones in the sun's full blaze, while clots of foam seethed up from <lb/>
            the spot. In a moment the truth has flashed upon her; the <lb/>
            Centaur had some dark design, when he beguiled her into <lb/>
            gathering the charm; doubtless the blood contained the same <lb/>
            poison which has always proved fatal to every creature it has <lb/>
            touched,-even to the god Cheiron, when accidentally wounded <lb/>
            by one of the arrows dipped by Heracles in the hydra's venom. <lb/>
            What, if she has killed her lord ! Death is all that then remains. <lb/>
            (11. 663-722.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus are endeavouring to allay her fears, when Hyllus <lb/>
            enters in excitement and confirms her worst presentiments. <lb/>
            Heracles is dying in agonies, and she is to blame. He had <lb/>
            received his wife's gift, and on the appointed day had clad him­ <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            self in the robe, to offer a great sacrifice. At first all went well, <lb/>
            but, as the heat of the fire called out the latent poison, the <lb/>
            garment clung to his flesh and preyed upon his very vitals. In <lb/>
            his anguish he called for the unhappy Lichas and dashed out <lb/>
            his brains in a transport of rage ; and then, as the pain became <lb/>
            more and more unendurable, his wish was to be removed any­ <lb/>
            where out of men's sight. Accordingly he was laid in a boat, <lb/>
            and conveyed from Eubœa to the Malian coast, and will soon <lb/>
            be at his home, alive or dead.</p>
          <p>Such is the story Hyllus unwillingly tells, and, having told it, <lb/>
            flings a bitter curse at his mother. Deianeira leaves the stage <lb/>
            without a word, and the Chorus sadly chant the sudden fulfilment <lb/>
            of the old prophecy. This then was to be the end of all toil for <lb/>
            Heracles ! The Centaur's craft has brought him to a fearful <lb/>
            end. Little did Deianeira reck of this ; she thought to cure, and <lb/>
            bitter indeed must be her mourning now ! Aphrodite's hand is <lb/>
            seen through all this fatal work. (11. 723-861.)</p>
          <p>A cry of sorrow from within the house, and the distress de­ <lb/>
            picted on the old nurse's features as she emerges, prepare the <lb/>
            maidens for bad news ; but they are seized with horror at the <lb/>
            tale she tells,-so far beyond the worst they feared. " Deianeira <lb/>
            is dead, slain by her own hand !" And the heart-broken old <lb/>
            servant goes on to describe how her mistress had rushed to her <lb/>
            bower from the sight of all, after a last farewell to her house­ <lb/>
            hold gods and such loved objects as she chanced to see, and <lb/>
            then, flinging herself upon the marriage-bed, in an agony of <lb/>
            tears, had prepared for the awful deed. Meantime, the faithful <lb/>
            nurse, who had been watching her from a place of concealment, <lb/>
            ran to fetch Hyllus ; but it was toc ate; when they returned <lb/>
            together the sword was in her hear then at last Hyllus knew <lb/>
            his error, and his grief was terrible to see. (11. 862-946.)</p>
          <p>" Oh for some strong breeze to waft me far away !" sigh the <lb/>
            Chorus. But it is no time for feeble lamentation, for strangers <lb/>
            are seen bearing Heracles on a litter towards the house. The <lb/>
            sufferer is asleep, but the unrestrained sorrow of Hyllus awakes <lb/>
            him, and the pain breaks out again. He prays for death. " Is <lb/>
            there not one among the thousands in Hellas, whom he has <lb/>
            succoured by his toils, to grant him this small boon ? At least, <lb/>
            his son might draw his sword, and end such agony. Of all the <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            many toils that he has faced without a groan, none was so dire <lb/>
            as this ; and to think that a hero like Heracles is brought to such <lb/>
            a pass by the hand of one feeble woman !</p>
          <p>This pitiful thought maddens him, and he calls on Hyllus to <lb/>
            bring forth the traitress, that she may meet her doom, for <lb/>
            " though I am as nought and cannot crawl a step, yet will I be <lb/>
            avenged on her that hath done this deed." (11. 947-1 III.)</p>
          <p>Exhausted by rage and pain, Heracles is still. Hyllus seizes <lb/>
            the opportunity to plead his mothers innocence, but the very <lb/>
            mention of her rouses another paroxysm in his father ; and it is <lb/>
            only with great difficulty that the suffering hero can be brought <lb/>
            to see that it was Nessus who had tricked her into using what <lb/>
            she thought was but a simple love-charm. (11. 1111-1142.)</p>
          <p>But at last he sees it all, and, accepting his doom, prepares <lb/>
            for death. The old oracles have all come true, but it is only <lb/>
            now that their full meaning is clear. For Hyllus his father has <lb/>
            two commands, to each of which obedience is exacted by oath. <lb/>
            The first is that the son shall carry his fathers body to the <lb/>
            summit of Mount CEta, and there, raising a mighty pyre, burn <lb/>
            him alive. Hyllus is forced to consent, under pain of being <lb/>
            haunted by his fathers avenging fiends, for ever, in case of dis­ <lb/>
            obedience. The only part of the task which he is excused is <lb/>
            the actual kindling of the pyre. (11. 1143-1217.)</p>
          <p>The second command is almost more exacting. He must <lb/>
            swear to wed Iole. " What! when she alone is to blame for my <lb/>
            mother's death, and for thy sorry plight besides ? Better be dead <lb/>
            than live thus !" But Heracles is inexorable, and Hyllus, first <lb/>
            calling the gods to witness that he does it under sore constraint, <lb/>
            once more takes the required oath. (11. 1218-1251.)</p>
          <p>The hero's mind is now at rest, and with an effort of final <lb/>
            endurance he bids his bearers lift their burden and set forth for <lb/>
            CEta's summit. Hyllus, seeing that the end has come, gives the <lb/>
            signal, and the sad procession starts, the bereaved son uttering <lb/>
            one last protest against the cruelty of the gods, and of Zeus in <lb/>
            particular. " They beget children, they are hailed as fathers, and <lb/>
            yet they can look calmly down on such sufferings. In all this <lb/>
            there is nought but Zeus." (11. 1252-1278.)</p><pb n="272"/>

          <p>DEI. There is an ancient saying amongst men, declared <lb/>
            in days of old, that thou canst not surely know the life of <lb/>
            mortal man, ere he die, whether it hath been for him a life <lb/>
            of weal or woe ; but for myself, or ever I have reached the <lb/>
            halls of Hades, right well I know that mine is but labour <lb/>
            and sorrow; I, who whilst yet 1 I dwelt at Pleuron in the <lb/>
            palace of CEneus, my father, had such a grievous dread of <lb/>
            marriage as never Ætolian maid hath felt. For there came <lb/>
            to woo me a river-god., e'en Achelous, who oft asked me of <lb/>
            my sire, appearing visibly in three shapes ; now as a bull he <lb/>
            would come; now as a writhing speckled snake; and other­ <lb/>
            whiles with human trunk and forehead of an ox,2 with <lb/>
            streams of his fountain's water gushing from his shaggy beard <lb/>
            on every side. Such was the suitor I had to expect; 3 to <lb/>
            die was, then, my constant prayer,-ah me !-or ever I <lb/>
            approached the bed of such a lord. But at last, and to my <lb/>
            joy, however late, there came the famous son of Zeus, <lb/>
            Alcmena's child, who met him in the lists of fight, delivering <lb/>
            me. As for the manner of their struggle, I cannot describe <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναίουσ</foreign>' tr' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign> with Erfurdt for vaiova' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign> of L. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύτει βούπρῳρος</foreign>, as given by Strabo, for MSS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύπῳ <lb/>

            it; I know it not; whoso sat to watch, nor quailed before <lb/>
            that sight, he might tell thereof,-not I, for I was sitting <lb/>
            there in wonderment and dread, for fear that beauty's gift <lb/>
            would win me sorrow at the last. But Zeus, the ruler of the <lb/>
            fray, ordained its issue happily,-if so indeed it be; for <lb/>
            from the day that I became one with Heracles as his own <lb/>
            chosen bride, I have ever been a prey to terror after terror, <lb/>
            anxious for his sake ; for one night brings a trouble to me, <lb/>
            and the next night in its turn doth thrust it thence.1 Chil­ <lb/>
            dren we have had, 'tis true, whom he has only seen at times, <lb/>
            e'en as a farmer with a distant field, the which he seeth once <lb/>
            at sowing, and at harvest once. Such was my husband's <lb/>
            life, that sent him ever faring to and fro, upon some master's <lb/>
            errands. But now, when he is clear of those his toils, 'tis <lb/>
            now I have the chiefest cause for fear. For ever since he <lb/>
            slew the mighty Iphitus, outcasts from house and home we <lb/>
            have been living here in Trachis at a stranger's 3 court; but <lb/>
            where he now is, that no one knows; only I know that he is <lb/>
            gone, causing me thereby cruel pangs on his behalf: Well- <lb/>
            nigh sure I am that some harm hath befallen him; for 'tis <lb/>
            no trifling time, but ten whole months and yet another five, <lb/>
            that he now tarries, and no tidings of him. There must be <lb/>
            some dire hap; that tablet tells me so which he left me ere <lb/>
            he started; oft do I pray the gods that I may have received <lb/>
            it without harm.4</p>

            thee :2 how comes it that thou, with all the sons thou hast, <lb/>
            yet sendest none of them in quest of thy lord, and chiefly <lb/>
            Hyllus,—whom this mission best becomes, if he have any <lb/>
            regard for his father, for his being thought in prosperous <lb/>
            case ?3</p>
          <p>But lo! I see him close at hand, speeding with timely <lb/>
            steps 4 towards the house; wherefore, if I seem to thee to <lb/>
            speak at all in season, thou canst make use of him and of my <lb/>

          <p>DEI. (as HYLLUS enters). My child, my boy, even from <lb/>
            base-born lips, it seems, the word in season falls; this <lb/>
            woman, to wit, although a slave, hath spoken as the free- <lb/>
            born would.</p>
          <p>HYL. What said she? Tell me, mother, if I may be told.</p>
          <p>DEI. It is a shame to thee, she said, not to have inquired <lb/>

            word, lady, should carry no offence, where Zeus is found to <lb/>

            the city of Eurytus; saying that he alone of mortal men had <lb/>
            had a share1 in causing him this woe; for when he came <lb/>
            unto his house to sit beside his hearth as a guest of many <lb/>
            years, Eurytus railed on him with many a sneering word <lb/>
            and baleful heart withal, saying,-" Spite of the unerring <lb/>
            arrows in thy hands, thou art far behind my sons in trials of <lb/>
            archery " ; then called him " a free man's slave," "a battered <lb/>
            wreck," and, lastly, at a feast, his guest being full of wine, <lb/>
            he cast him from his doors. Now Heracles was wroth at <lb/>
            this; so, when Iphitus 2 came another time to the hill of <lb/>
            Tiryns, following the tracks of his mares, that had strayed, <lb/>
            he flung him from the summit of a tower-like height,3 the <lb/>
            while both eye and thought were ranging otherwhither. <lb/>
            But for this deed king Zeus, the sire of all, who dwelleth <lb/>
            on Olympus, was angered, and sent him forth to be sold as <lb/>
            a slave, impatient of his deed, because in slaying this one <lb/>
            man he used his only guile. Had he avenged him openly, <lb/>
            Zeus, I trow, had pardoned him a victory justly won; for <lb/>
            gods, no more than men, love insolence.' Now they,5 with <lb/>
            their overweening pride and evil tongues, are themselves all <lb/>
            dwellers in the house of Hades, and their city is enslaved; <lb/>
            while these women thou seest, fallen from their happy state <lb/>
            on joyless days, are on their way to thee; for so thy lord <lb/>
            commanded, and I, his faithful servant, do his bidding. He <lb/>
            will be here himself anon, be well assured, as soon as he <lb/>

          <p>MES. I heard that fellow say, in the presence of many <lb/>
            witnesses, 'twas for yonder girl that Heracles slew Eurytus <lb/>
            and sacked CEchalia's lofty towers; and Love was the only <lb/>

            never look for that ;.-it is not likely, if his heart is fired <lb/>

            show thee all that I had learnt from yonder man. And <lb/>
            there were many Trachinians with me, listening to his story, <lb/>
            even as I was, in the midst of their place of gathering, so <lb/>
            that they can convict him. Now if my words offend, I am <lb/>
            sorry for it; still I have told the honest truth.</p>
          <p>DEI. Ah, woe is me! In what plight am I now? What <lb/>

            Is she as nameless, then, as he, who brought her, sware ?</p>

            birth,-a daughter of Eurytus by lineage, by name Iole erst, <lb/>
            of whose origin that herald had never a word to tell, because, <lb/>

            him who practiseth these secret villainies to his own dis. <lb/>

          <p>DEI. Maidens mine, what must I do ? I feel bewildered <lb/>

          <p>CHO. Go and inquire of the herald; maybe he would tell <lb/>
            the truth, if thou wouldst straitly question him.</p>
          <p>DEI. Yea, go I will; thou givest sound advice.</p>
          <p>MES. And I,—am I to stay, or what to do?</p>

            pierced through the heart of Heracles; for her sake yon <lb/>
            ruined town, CEchalia, her native place, was razed before his <lb/>
            spear. And this he never told me to conceal, nor himself <lb/>

          <p>DEI. Friends, while our guest, with a view to his journey, <lb/>
            is speaking with the captive maidens in the house, I have <lb/>
            come forth to you by stealth, partly to tell you what my <lb/>
            hands have devised, and partly to bewail my woes in com­ <lb/>
            pany. I have taken to my house with the rest,-as doth a <lb/>
            sailor when he ships a freight,-a maiden, no ! a maiden no <lb/>
            more, I trow, a mistress rather,-a bale to wreck my peace <lb/>
            of mind.2 And now we wait the same embrace, we two to <lb/>
            share one bed. Such the guerdon Heracles, my husband <lb/>
            good and true, as I was used to call him, hath sent me in <lb/>
            return for keeping his house so long. Be wroth with him, I <lb/>
            know not how, oft as he is sick of this disease; but live with <lb/>
            her, and share a husband's love,-what woman could? And <lb/>
            it would come to that; for hers, I see, is beauty ripening <lb/>
            still, while mine is in decay; and the eye is wont to snatch <lb/>
            youth's bloom, but from that other turns away.3 This, then, <lb/>
            is my fear, lest Heracles, though called my lord, should be <lb/>
            my younger rival's love. But since, as I said, it ill becomes <lb/>
            a woman of sense to show anger, I will tell you, friends, how <note type="footnote"> 1 The text of the MSS., <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ δὲ μάτηρ μὲν οἶα φράζω</foreign>, which has been <lb/>

            hid it in a brazen vessel,-the gift I took, while yet a girl, <lb/>
            from shaggy-chested Nessus, from the wounds of the dying <lb/>
            Centaur, who, for a price, would carry men' in his arms <lb/>
            across the deep stream of the Evenus, without the use of <lb/>
            oar or sail to send them on their way. Now he was e'en <lb/>
            carrying me upon his shoulders, when, sent by my sire,2 I first <lb/>
            followed Heracles to be his bride; and, I being now half­ <lb/>
            way across, he laid lewd hands on me, and I cried out; <lb/>
            whereon the son of Zeus turned round forthwith, and from <lb/>
            his hands let fly a feathered shaft, and into his lungs it <lb/>
            whizzed, piercing through his chest. Thus spake the <lb/>
            monster, lying faint in death : " Daughter of aged CEneus, <lb/>
            thus much profit shalt thou get of my ferrying,-so thou <lb/>
            list,-because thou wert my latest charge. If thou with <lb/>

            thoughts, but see that I have done a fearful deed. For <lb/>
            wherefore, pray, or in return for what, should the monster, <lb/>
            when dying, have shown good-will to me, on whose account <lb/>
            he died? Not so; but he was beguiling me, bent on <lb/>
            destroying his own slayer ■ whereof I gain the knowledge all <lb/>
            too late, when it avails no more. Ah, woe is me ! for unless <lb/>
            haply I prove wrong in my surmise, I, and I alone, shall <lb/>
            plunge my lord in utter ruin. For I know that the arrow <lb/>
            he sped had power to hurt e'en Cheiron, a god withal, and <lb/>
            whatso 3 beast it ever touch is doomed. And must it not <lb/>

            which welled from yon Centaur's wound? It must be so, I <lb/>
            feel. Yet 'tis my fixed resolve, if he shall come to harm, to <lb/>
            link my death to his, taking the self-same plunge; for to <lb/>
            live with a sullied name is what no woman, who prizes her <lb/>

            and a leafy precinct to Zeus, the god of his fathers, at the <lb/>

            I saw him first, glad sight to longing eyes. Now he was <lb/>
            just preparing to slay full many a victim, when Lichas, his <lb/>
            own herald, arrived from home, bringing thy gift, the deadly <lb/>
            robe; and he put it on, as thou didst bid erewhile, and so <lb/>
            began the sacrifice with twelve bulls, free from all blemish, <lb/>
            the first-fruits of the spoil; though, taken all together, one <lb/>
            hundred victims of all kinds were brought to the altar by <lb/>
            him. At first, poor wretch, he prayed in gracious mood, <lb/>
            pleased with the adornment of his robe. But when from <lb/>
            the holy rites the flame blazed up, fed by the blood and the <lb/>
            sap of the wood, a sweat broke out upon his skin, and the <lb/>
            robe clung unto his sides, glued as by a craftsman's hand <lb/>
            to every limb, while fierce convulsions racked his bones; <lb/>
            and then it preyed upon his flesh, as it had been1 some fell <lb/>
            and deadly viper's poison. Thereupon he cried aloud for <lb/>
            the hapless Lichas, who was wholly guiltless of thy crime, <lb/>
            asking how2 he came to bring that robe; but Lichas, poor <lb/>
            wretch, knowing nought, told him it was thy gift and none <lb/>
            other's, just as it was sent. When Heracles heard that, as <lb/>
            a spasm of the thrilling pain seized hold upon his lungs, he <lb/>
            caught him by the foot, where turns the ankle-joint, and <lb/>
            hurled him at a sea-beat rock, which rose from out the <lb/>
            waves; spattering white brain from the hairy scalp, as the <lb/>
            crown of the skull was all scattered in bits, and blood poured <lb/>
            forth therewith. And all the folk brake forth in cries of <lb/>
            woe, to see one mad, the other done to death; and no man <lb/>
            dared to stand before the man. For now a spasm brought <lb/>
            him to the ground, then made him spring into the air, with <lb/>
            shouts and yells; while the rocks were ringing all around, <lb/>
            the headlands of the Locrian hills and Eubœa's promon­ <lb/>
            tories. Now, when he was faint with throwing himself in <lb/>
            anguish oft upon the ground, and with crying oft in loud <lb/>
            lament, cursing his ill-matched union with a wretch like <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὣς</foreign> with Wakefield for MSS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> a Others, " with what evil design." </note> <pb n="302"/>

            thee, his marriage with one of CEneus' race,-a prize, for­ <lb/>
            sooth, that wrecked his life, when won,—then, from out <lb/>
            the veil of smoke, lifting his distorted gaze, he saw me in <lb/>
            the press of men with streaming eye, and, seeing me, he <lb/>
            cried: "My son, come hither; fly not from my woe, not <lb/>
            though thou have to share my death. Nay, lift and bear <lb/>
            me hence; and, if it may be, set me1 in some spot, where <lb/>
            none of mortal men shall e'er set eyes on me; or, if thy pity <lb/>
            sticks at that, at least transport me from this land forthwith, <lb/>
            and let me not die here." No sooner had he given these <lb/>
            commands than we laid him in the centre of the ship, and <lb/>
            so,-though scarcely thus,—we brought him to land here, <lb/>
            roaring the while in his spasms; and soon will ye see him, <lb/>

            tears would flow, whene'er her poor hands touched some <lb/>
            chattel she had used in days of yore; and, as she. ranged <lb/>
            from room to room, the sight of any servant whom she loved <lb/>
            would make her weep, poor soul, appealing the while to her <lb/>
            own hard lot and her childless home2henceforth. But when <lb/>
            she ceased from this, suddenly I saw her dart into the <lb/>
            chamber of Heracles; and I kept watch on her from a <lb/>
            hidden place of outlook. And I saw his poor wife lay the <lb/>

            Lost, lost! No more for me the light of life ! Woe is me ! <lb/>
            Yes, now I see the straits in which I stand ! Away, my son ! <lb/>
            Thy father's days are sped. Summon me thy brethren, all <lb/>
            my sons, and with them the hapless Alcmena, bride of Zeus <lb/>
            to little end,-that ye may learn from me the last I have to <lb/>
            say,-the oracles I know.</p>
          <p>HYL. Thy mother is not here, but hath her home at <lb/>
            Tiryns by the sea,—so chance ordains; and she hath taken <lb/>
            some of thy children with her and is bringing them up <note type="footnote"> 1 So Erfurdt and Hermann, placing a comma after <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρη̃μ</foreign>’. Paley and <lb/>

            there, while others thou mayst hear are dwelling in the <lb/>
            town of Thebes. But all of us now here, father, will serve <lb/>
            thee to the last, as we are told, in aught there is to do.</p>
          <p>HER. Hear thou, then, the work in hand. The time is <lb/>
            come for thee to show what claim thou hast to be called son <lb/>
            of mine. It was foreshown me by my sire, in days long <lb/>
            gone, that I should not be slain by aught that breathed the <lb/>
            breath of life,' but by one already dead and housed with <lb/>
            Hades. And so it is the monster Centaur hath slain me, <lb/>
            the dead slaying the living, just as God's oracle foretold. <lb/>
            And I will declare new prophecies, whose issue doth agree <lb/>
            with these, of like tenor with the old;2 these I wrote me <lb/>
            down, from the whispering of my father's oak, the many- <lb/>
            tongued, when I came to the grove of the Selli, whose home <lb/>
            is on the hills, and on the earth their bed; which told me <lb/>
            that, at this hour now living3 and with us, a full release from <lb/>
            all my load of woes should come; methought of happy days <lb/>
            in store; but death was my release, it seems,-and death <lb/>
            alone; for woe no more befalls the dead. Since, then, my <lb/>
            son, these things are clearly coming true, 'tis thy turn now <lb/>
            to lend thy father aid, delaying not till thou provoke my <lb/>
            tongue to wrath,' but yielding of thine own accord thy help, <lb/>
            finding out that best of laws,-obedience to a sire.</p>
          <p>HYL. Father, though I have my fears, when brought to <lb/>
            such a point in speech,5 yet will I obey in what seems good <lb/>
            to thee.</p>

            logs, then lay my body on the pyre, and, taking in thy hand <lb/>
            a blazing torch of pine,2 set fire thereto. And let no tear <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>AFTER the death of Achilles, his arms were set up as a prize for <lb/>
            the most valiant of the Achæans. The story of the contest is <lb/>
            only briefly alluded to by Homer (" Odyss.," xi. 543-560), but is <lb/>
            given at considerable length by Quintus Smyrnæus (" Post­ <lb/>
            homerica," v. 123-663). His account is as follows. When the <lb/>
            funeral games in honour of Achilles were finished, his mother <lb/>
            Thetis proclaimed to the Argive warriors, that the divine weapons <lb/>
            of her son should be given to him who had saved the corpse <lb/>
            from the Trojans, and proved himself the best of the Achæans. <lb/>
            Whereupon Odysseus and Ajax, son of Telamon, rose to make <lb/>
            their claims, and, when no decision could be arrived at, the <lb/>
            matter was referred to the Trojan captives, who decided with <lb/>
            one voice in favour of Odysseus. According to Sophocles, who <lb/>
            gives but few details of the story, the award was made by chosen <lb/>
            judges of the Achæans, though it is hinted that undue influence <lb/>
            may have been brought to bear on the less influential voters by <lb/>
            the Atreidae, or even that the votes may have been tampered <lb/>
            with. Be that as it may, the result caused Ajax such bitter grief <lb/>
            and indignation that, after brooding sullenly over his defeat for <lb/>
            several days, he, at last, in mad frenzy, attacked the flocks and <lb/>
            herds belonging to the host, under the idea that he was taking <lb/>
            vengeance on the hated Atreidæ and their immediate followers <lb/>
            The majority of these details are only introduced incidentally in <lb/>
            the course of the play, which opens on the day following this <lb/>
            wild slaughter of the cattle. The scene is laid in the Troad, in <lb/>
            that part of the Achæan camp where Ajax and his Salaminian <lb/>
            sailors,-who form the Chorus,-are quartered. It is still early <lb/>
            dawn, when Odysseus is discovered tracking out the footsteps <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            of Ajax near the huts on the beach. He has his suspicions, and <lb/>
            these are confirmed, beyond a shadow of doubt, by the goddess <lb/>
            Athene, who, in a long conversation with him, describes how <lb/>
            Ajax stole forth by night to slay the captains of the host, and <lb/>
            how she drove him mad and diverted his fell rage to the cattle ; <lb/>
            of these he slew some, while others were dragged off to his <lb/>
            dwelling to be foully entreated. (11. 1-65.) However, Odysseus <lb/>
            shall see for himself; and, in spite of that hero's unwillingness <lb/>
            to run the risk of facing a madman, Athene summons Ajax <lb/>
            forth. In the conversation which ensues between him and the <lb/>
            goddess, the whole horror of the situation is vividly portrayed. <lb/>
            The eyes of Ajax are miraculously dimmed, so that he sees not <lb/>
            Odysseus, against whom his hatred is as bitter as ever. He <lb/>
            hails the malignant goddess as his staunch ally, and exultingly <lb/>
            unfolds to her, in the hearing of Odysseus, the success of his <lb/>
            attack and the horrible punishment he intends to mete out to his <lb/>
            prisoners,-to none more cruelly than to Odysseus. Nothing <lb/>
            shall save him,—no! not even the intercession of Athene. <lb/>
            (11. 66-117.)</p>
          <p>Odysseus has witnessed his enemy's ravings, and the sight <lb/>
            only fills him with pity ; there is a certain magnanimity in him, <lb/>
            not untinged, however, with selfishness ; he may one day be in <lb/>
            evil case himself, so uncertain and changeable is the life of all <lb/>
            mortals. " Even so ;" says Athene, " beware then of pride and <lb/>
            boastfulness ; the gods love those of sober heart." (11. 118-133.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus of Salaminian sailors enter, and excitedly de­ <lb/>
            nounce the foul slander brought against their beloved master. <lb/>
            It is Odysseus who has spread the lying tale they have just <lb/>
            heard ; small wonder he wins belief; it is the way of the world ; <lb/>
            "aim at a mighty spirit, and thou wilt not miss thy mark." If <lb/>
            only Ajax would show himself, these chattering jays would <lb/>
            cower and fly before the mighty vulture ; but, without him, his <lb/>
            faithful followers cannot repel the evil rumour. Who can have <lb/>
            driven him so distraught ? Was it Artemis, or the War-god <lb/>
            maybe? Never of himself would he have erred so grievously. <lb/>
            Zeus and Apollo avert the tale of shame ! Come forth, master, <lb/>
            and champion thy good fame and ours ! (11. 134-200.)</p>
          <p>At this point Tecmessa appears upon the scene, and the <lb/>
            Chorus gather from what she tells them that the rumour about <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            Ajax is all too true. She had witnessed part of his mad be­ <lb/>
            haviour, though she knew not as yet all that had occurred on <lb/>
            the past night; she relates to his horrified followers, how he had <lb/>
            tortured his victims, hacking some and scourging others in his <lb/>
            hut; and how, when the first paroxysm was over and the cloud <lb/>
            partly lifted from his mind, his anguish became even more <lb/>
            terrible, as he began to realise what he had done. (11. 200-280.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus press for more details of their master's mad <lb/>
            doings; and Tecmessa again recounts all she has seen,-the <lb/>
            stealthy midnight sally ; the return with a mixed drove of cattle ; <lb/>
            the slaughter of the harmless beasts, and the wild abuse of <lb/>
            imaginary foes ; and, at last, the slow and painful recovery of <lb/>
            reason. " But," adds Tecmessa, " I fear there is worse to come ; <lb/>
            everything points to a fatal issue ; come and help me, if ye can ; <lb/>
            men of his stem mood will often listen to friends." (11. 281-332.)</p>
          <p>The voice of Ajax is now heard within his hut, raised in lamen­ <lb/>
            tion ; and, when the door opens, he is disclosed, sitting amongst <lb/>
            the slaughtered cattle. Catching sight of his trusty mariners, <lb/>
            he entreats them to end his dishonoured life. Tecmessa tries to <lb/>
            calm him, but he roughly bids her cease. " Hence, woman ; <lb/>
            begone from my sight !" Then the Chorus offer him such poor <lb/>
            comfort as they can, only to hear him break into wild abuse of <lb/>
            Odysseus, coupled with a passionate prayer for instant death. <lb/>
            " No longer am I fit to- look to gods for succour, nor yet for any <lb/>
            help of man." (11. 333-409.)</p>
          <p>Nothing is left now but shame and sorrow; one thing alone <lb/>
            is clear ; life henceforth has become impossible ; Troy, that has <lb/>
            known him so long, shall know him no more ; Ajax has been <lb/>
            humbled and disgraced ; death is the brave man's last resource ; <lb/>
            so welcome death ! (11. 410-480.)</p>
          <p>" Let friends prevail to bend thy purpose," urge the Chorus. <lb/>
            " Have pity on me and thy defenceless babe," pleads Tecmessa. <lb/>
            " What awaits us but slavery, when thou art gone ! Surely past <lb/>
            affection is not to go for nothing !" (11. 481-524.)</p>
          <p>Ajax cuts short these piteous appeals by calling for his son <lb/>
            Eurysaces, and, when the child is brought, all the tenderness <lb/>
            which lurks concealed within his rugged nature, bursts forth ; <lb/>
            he is proud of the boy whom his captive bride has borne him, and <lb/>
            prays that he may grow up in his father's own rough ways. <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            Then, after bequeathing him his famous shield, he entrusts the <lb/>
            child to his Salaminian followers, leaving with them full in­ <lb/>
            structions for Teucer, his foster-brother, on his arrival. (11. <lb/>
            525-582.)</p>
          <p>This done, he orders the doors to be shut, and all sounds of <lb/>
            sorrow to be silenced, treating the heart-broken Tecmessa with a <lb/>
            harshness in strong contrast to his late tenderness for their child.</p>
          <p>The Chorus, once more left to themselves, break forth into <lb/>
            mourning over the fall of their peerless chief, and their own long <lb/>
            weary sojourn in Troy, far from their glorious island-home. <lb/>
            " Ah, and what heavy tidings await the parents of Ajax ! To <lb/>
            think that the evening of their life should close amid such <lb/>
            sorrow!" (11. 583-645.)</p>
          <p>Presently Ajax re-appears, with Hector's sword in his hand. <lb/>
            His resolution is taken, and he is externally calm and self­ <lb/>
            possessed, professing himself changed in temper. " I go to <lb/>
            purge away my stains, if haply I may escape Athene's wrath." <lb/>
            " All things yield to authority : why not I as well ? Yes, I have <lb/>
            learnt my lesson. All shall now be well. Go ye and do as I <lb/>
            have said." (11. 646-692.) The Chorus, no less than Tecmessa, <lb/>
            are completely deceived by this dissembling. Little do they <lb/>
            guess the real purpose of Ajax, as they raise a joyful strain, <lb/>
            calling upon Pan and Apollo to come and share their mirth !</p>
          <p>Ajax," they sing, “ has forgotten his sorrows ; no more is he <lb/>
            breathing out rage and defiance against the Atreidæ ; the days <lb/>
            of happiness will come again." (11. 693-717.)</p>
          <p>But their joy is short-lived ; for a messenger enters with the <lb/>
            news that Teucer, who has just returned, has sent a most urgent <lb/>
            message to keep Ajax closely watched, until his own coming. <lb/>
            " What can this portend ? " ask the chorus of the messenger, in <lb/>
            consternation. " It was owing to a friendly warning given by <lb/>
            Calchas, the seer, to Teucer." "Ajax," he said, "must, at all <lb/>
            costs, be kept indoors for this one day, after which the anger of <lb/>
            Athene will no more pursue him. It is Athene who is plaguing <lb/>
            him for his rash pride, when, in days gone by, he scorned her <lb/>
            proffered aid." " Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty <lb/>
            spirit before a fall." (11. 718-783.) Such is the disquieting mes­ <lb/>
            sage delivered to the Chorus, and by them to Tecmessa. The <lb/>
            worst is to be feared. Ajax has indeed gone forth, and, unless <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            the seer is at fault, it maybe too late already to save the doomed <lb/>
            hero. None the less, Tecmessa entreats the help of the Sala­ <lb/>
            minian sailors, and all sally forth in different directions to see if <lb/>
            they can avert the dreaded catastrophe. (11. 784-812.) There <lb/>
            is a moment's pause, as the Chorus leave the orchestra, and then <lb/>
            the scene changes, and Ajax is discovered alone upon the sea- <lb/>
            shore, preparing to meet his end. Before him, firmly planted in <lb/>
            the ground by the hilt, stands Hector's sword, fit instrument for <lb/>
            the fatal act. All is now ready, and, in a grand soliloquy of un­ <lb/>
            surpassed pathos and beauty, the desperate warrior bids farewell <lb/>
            to life. A prayer to the gods for an easy death ; a curse on the <lb/>
            Atreidae, who have brought him to this pass ; one word of pity <lb/>
            for his aged parents ; a solemn invocation of the death-god, <lb/>
            whom he goes to meet; one last look on Sun and Earth, one <lb/>
            final utterance of thanks to Nature for her bounteous care,-and <lb/>
            Ajax has fallen on'his-sword. (11. 813-865.)</p>
          <p>At this supreme moment the Chorus re-enter in two bands <lb/>
            from different directions ; their trouble has been unrewarded; <lb/>
            they have found no trace of their missing chief. Not so Tec­ <lb/>
            messa ; instinct, or chance, has guided her aright ; and her <lb/>
            piercing cry proclaims to the Chorus that their worst fears have <lb/>
            been realized. Yes, there is Ajax, fallen upon his sword, amid <lb/>
            the brushwood of a little copse upon the beach ; Tecmessa has <lb/>
            found his bleeding body, and, flinging herself beside it in an <lb/>
            agony of grief, covers her beloved lord with her own mantle. <lb/>
            (11. 866-924.)</p>
          <p>" So this was the appointed end ; this the meaning of those <lb/>
            fierce complaints by night and day against the Atreidae; this <lb/>
            the sequel to the contest for the arms ! Doubtless now that <lb/>
            malignant chief, the much-enduring son of Laertes, is laughing <lb/>
            loud with the Atreidae over our poor master's fall !" Thus <lb/>
            bitterly the Chorus muse ; and bitterly rejoins Tecmessa : "Well, <lb/>
            let them laugh : the day will come, maybe, when they will miss <lb/>
            his trusty hand. What is thi's to them ? Ajax has found the <lb/>
            death he craved : 'twas Heaven's decree, not theirs." (11. 925- <lb/>
            973.)</p>
          <p>Teucer appears in the midst of their lamentations, and, after <lb/>
            giving instructions that Eurysaces shall be at once removed <lb/>
            from the power of his enemies and brought to him, bewails the <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            sad end of Ajax in passionate strains. " How shall I ever face <lb/>
            Telamon, the sire of Ajax and myself, whose temper, ever short, <lb/>
            will be doubly peevish now?" "The gifts of foes are no gifts, <lb/>
            and bring no gain." So Ajax found it, and so it is. Hector <lb/>
            and Ajax alike perished by their gifts to each other. (11. 974- <lb/>
            1039.)</p>
          <p>Further speech is cut short by the sudden arrival of Menelaus, <lb/>
            who comes to forbid the burial of Ajax. " Murderer as he was <lb/>
            to all intents and purposes, let him be cast forth dishonoured, a <lb/>
            prey to the birds of the sea. He would not listen to us in life, <lb/>
            but, now that he is dead, we will control him. How shall order <lb/>
            or good government be maintained, where men do as they list ?" <lb/>
            (11. 1040-1090.) Teucer defies this insolent order, asking by what <lb/>
            right of lordship the Atreidæ think to prevail. Was Ajax their <lb/>
            slave ? After much mutual recrimination, Menelaus rushes away <lb/>
            in a rage to bring force and compel obedience, while Teucer <lb/>
            goes to make hurried preparations for the burial, after bidding <lb/>
            Tecmessa and her child sit by the corpse as suppliants till his <lb/>
            return. Meantime the Chorus, in gloomy strains, lament (11. <lb/>
            1091-1184) their own hard lot. " When will this weary war be <lb/>
            over ? Curses on the man who first taught the art of war to <lb/>
            sons of Hellas ! He it was who reft us of all joy in life, and <lb/>
            brought us to this dreary Troy. And now our champion is taken <lb/>
            from us,—our last hope is gone. Oh ! to be wafted hence <lb/>
            'neath Sunium's cliff, to greet the sacred citadel of Athens !” <lb/>
            (11. 1185-1222.)</p>
          <p>Teucer re-enters in haste, having seen Agamemnon approach­ <lb/>
            ing with angry aspect. No sooner has the general of the host <lb/>
            appeared than he breaks out into violent abuse of " the son of <lb/>
            the captive woman." " What ! has he dared to stand up against <lb/>
            the authority of his betters, and champion one who is as naught ? <lb/>
            Was Ajax the only man in all the host ? Are the Atreidae never <lb/>
            to hear the end of his disappointed rage at the fair decision of <lb/>
            the judges about the arms of Achilles ? God forbid ! The whip <lb/>
            is good for the ox, and Teucer may find it an equally good cure <lb/>
            for his refractory temper. Let him look to it,-and, before he <lb/>
            speaks again, find some free man to plead his cause." (11. 1223- <lb/>
            1263.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus endeavour to interpose and stay this undignified <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            wrangling, but Teucer is not to be silenced. " So this is all the <lb/>
            gratitude a man finds after death ! All the past services of Ajax <lb/>
            are now as though they had not been. What boots it that he <lb/>
            faced Hector single-handed, and saved the fleet from fire? How <lb/>
            now ? Shall Agamemnon dare to taunt another with base birth ? <lb/>
            Has he forgotten his own mother's shameful history, or the <lb/>
            hideous story of his house ? Let him look to it how he threatens <lb/>
            a son of Telamon and Hesione, or tries to prevent a brave man's <lb/>
            burial !" (11. 1264-1315.) It seems as if the heated quarrel <lb/>
            must lead to open violence, when fortunately Odysseus appears, <lb/>
            and urges moderation. At the risk of offending Agamemnon, he <lb/>
            pleads for the honourable burial of his late foe. " To harm <lb/>
            brave men when they are dead is no fair thing." This champion­ <lb/>
            ship of the corpse of Ajax has come from the least expected <lb/>
            quarter, and it is with a very bad grace that Agamemnon is at <lb/>
            last constrained to yield, expressing undying hatred of Ajax even <lb/>
            while he does so. (11. 1316-1373.)</p>
          <p>As soon as the angry king has left the stage, Odysseus turns <lb/>
            to Teucer and offers his friendship and assistance. He would <lb/>
            fain help bury Ajax. Teucer bluntly thanks him, but refuses his <lb/>
            aid in the actual burial, for fear of offending the dead. Odysseus <lb/>
            acquiesces, and Teucer at once proceeds with the funeral rites, <lb/>
            while the Chorus, deeply impressed with the uncertainty of <lb/>
            human life, as exemplified in the fall of Ajax, sadly chant the <lb/>
            solemn truth, which he had failed to grasp : No man can read <lb/>
            the future, to see how he will fare." (11. 1374-1420.) <note type="footnote"> NOTE.-For the translation of the “ Ajax," the text followed <lb/>

          <p>ATH. Ever have I seen thee, son of Laertes, seeking to <lb/>
            snatch some occasion against thy foes;1 and now at the <lb/>
            huts of Ajax near the ships, at his station on the camp's out­ <lb/>
            skirts, I perceive thee this long while tracking with hunter's <lb/>
            care and scanning the fresh traces of his foot-prints, to learn <lb/>
            whether he is within or not. And right well are thy steps <lb/>
            bearing thee to thy goal, with scent as keen as any Spartan <lb/>
            hound's. For thy quarry hath but just gone within,-the <lb/>
            sweat streaming from his head, and his murderous hands <lb/>
            still reeking. No need, then, for thee to be peering any <lb/>
            longer within these doors ; but tell the reason of this thy <lb/>
            eager quest, that thou mayst learn of her who knows.</p>
          <p>ODY. 0 voice of Athene, most dear to me of powers <lb/>
            divine, how plainly do I hear thy words, e'en though thou <lb/>
            art but seen afar," and with my soul I catch the sound, as if <lb/>
            the brazen lips of Tyrrhene trumpet should speak ! And <lb/>
            now hast thou deemed aright, that it is on a foeman's track <lb/>
            I am making my cast,-on the track of Ajax of the famous <note type="footnote"> 1 This has also been understood, " seeking to forestall some attempt <lb/>
            of foes. ” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Others render <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄποπτος</foreign> " unseen;" but on aesthetic grounds it is <lb/>
            hard to believe that Athene carries on a lengthy dialogue with Odysseus, <lb/>
            and then with Ajax, entirely unseen. As Jebb justly objects, the effect <lb/>
            would at last have become ludicrous. It is true that the other meaning <lb/>
            is not very clearly supported. </note> <pb n="330"/>

            down. For, in the night just past, he hath done to us a <lb/>
            deed too strange to comprehend,-if indeed it be his doing; <lb/>
            for we know nothing for certain, but are at a loss; and I <lb/>
            offered to undertake this service. For lo ! we have just <lb/>
            found all our spoils of cattle slain,-done to death by violent <lb/>
            hands,-and those, that watched the flocks, dead too. This <lb/>
            guilt, then, one and all assign to him. Yea, and I have the <lb/>
            story of a scout who spied him all alone, as he careered o'er <lb/>
            the plains with sword still dripping,-and he told me all. At <lb/>

            casting on his eyes distracting fantasies, and I turned him <lb/>
            aside against the flocks and mingled herds, spoil still un­ <lb/>

            horned beast to death ; one while, thinking that he had the <lb/>
            two Atreidæ in his grip, and was slaying them; anon this <lb/>

            raved in frenzied fits, my hand would urge him on, driving <lb/>
            him into the fatal toils. Next, when he had rested from <lb/>
            this toil, he bound fast together such of the oxen as were <lb/>
            still alive, and all the sheep likewise, and drove them to his <lb/>

          <p>TEC. 'Tis so no more; his fit is past like keen south wind, <lb/>
            -one rush, and then a lull, and lightnings cease to flash ;9 <lb/>
            and now, with his senses returned, he feels fresh pain. For <lb/>
            the sight of self-inflicted woes, to which no other put a hand, <lb/>
            intensifies the agony.</p>
          <p>CHO. Nay, but if his fit is o'er, all may yet be well, I <lb/>
            trow ; for, when once the in is gone, 'tis less accounted of.</p>
          <p>TEC. But which wouldst thou choose, if one gave thee <lb/>
            the choice,-to pain thy friends and yet have joy thyself, or <lb/>
            to share their sorrows with a mutual grief?</p>
          <p>CHO. The twofold evil is the greater, surely, lady.</p>
          <p>TEC. Why then Me, without being mad, are the sufferers <lb/>

            wind necessarily of short duration because there is no lightning ? The <lb/>
            conjecture <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαμπρὸς</foreign> would perhaps improve the sense " with a clear <lb/>

          <p>TEC. Yon man, our Ajax, while the fit was on him, found <lb/>
            pleasure of his own in the horrors that possessed him, <lb/>
            though to us, who were sane, 'twas pain to have him thus; <lb/>
            but now that he hath pause from his complaint, and breath­ <lb/>
            ing space withal, his whole being is tormented with bitter <lb/>
            sorrow, and so too ours, no less than formerly. Is not this <lb/>
            a double woe, two ills instead of one ?</p>
          <p>CHO. Yea, I agree with thee, and I fear that some blow <lb/>
            from Heaven hath come on him. It must be so, if, now <lb/>
            that he hath pause, he rejoiceth not more than when he was <lb/>
            distraught.</p>
          <p>TEC. 'Tis even so, be sure of that.</p>
          <p>CHO. How did the evil first settle upon him ? Declare <lb/>
            to us who sympathise all that befell.</p>
          <p>TEC. Thou shalt learn the whole matter, as a sharer <lb/>
            therein.1 At dead of night,2 when the evening fires 3 no <lb/>
            longer blazed, he caught up a two-edged sword and sought <lb/>
            to steal forth on some bootless errand. Whereat I rebuked <lb/>
            him, saying, " What doest thou, Ajax ? Why art thou <lb/>
            starting on this enterprise uncalled, neither summoned by <lb/>
            messengers nor trumpet's voice? Nay, as yet the whole <lb/>
            host sleepeth."</p>
          <p>But short his answer came, in well-worn phrase:­ <lb/>
            " Woman, silence lends a grace to women." And I, upon <lb/>
            this hint, gave o'er; but he rushed forth alone. Now as to <lb/>
            what befell out there, it is not mine to tell; but, on return­ <lb/>
            ing to our roof, he had with him a captive drove of bulls, <lb/>
            and shepherds' dogs, and fleecy 4. prey.

            the throats of some he cut, bending back their heads, and <lb/>
            cleft them to the spine; others, still bound, he tormented <lb/>
            as though they were men, falling on flocks the while. At <lb/>
            last, darting out through the door, he began uttering wild <lb/>
            words to some phantom shape, partly against the Atreidæ, <lb/>
            partly about Odysseus, with many an added laugh, as he <lb/>
            told of all the outrage he had gone and wreaked on them. <lb/>
            Then rushing back again into his dwelling, at last, by slow <lb/>
            degrees, his senses came again ; and, as his eye surveyed <lb/>
            the house, filled with that scene of woe, he smote his head <lb/>
            and cried aloud; and, falling among the carcases of <lb/>
            butchered sheep, he sat with nails clutched tightly in his <lb/>
            hair. Long while he sat without a word ; then flung at <lb/>
            me those fearful threats, unless I showed him the whole <lb/>
            matter as it chanced ; and asked what plight might now <lb/>
            be his. And I, friends, in my terror, told him all that he <lb/>
            had done, so far as I had certain knowledge. Straight­ <lb/>
            way from his lips there burst loud cries of woe, such as I <lb/>
            never heard from him before; for aye his teaching was, <lb/>
            that wailing on this wise proclaimed the sorry, abject knave; <lb/>
            not his to utter shrill laments, but, bull-like, deep low <lb/>
            moans.</p>
          <p>But now o'erthrown, in such sore plight, silently our <lb/>
            Ajax sits, there where he fell, amid the kine his sword hath <lb/>
            slain, tasting neither food nor drink. And plainly he is <lb/>
            bent on mischief,-so strange his words and his laments. <lb/>
            Come then, friends,-for this is what brought me hither,­ <lb/>

            so sad my present plight; whose father by his prowess bore <lb/>
            off valour's prize, the first of all the host, and so gat home <lb/>
            with all fair fame from this Idæan land; while I his son, <lb/>

            might behind him not a whit, whose hand in service wrought <lb/>

            of a free-born sire, a mighty man and rich, if ever Phrygian <lb/>
            was; and to-day I am a slave. For this was the will of <lb/>
            Heaven, maybe,-as 'twas thy work in chief. So now, made <lb/>
            partner of thy bed, thine is the good I have at heart; then <lb/>
            by the Zeus that guards our hearth, and by thy couch which <lb/>
            made thee one with me,3 I pray thee, think me not a <lb/>
            proper mark for all the bitter things thy foes may say, leaving <lb/>
            me at the mercy of any of them ! For on the day that thou <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e., a life, which at best, is but a respite from death, can afford no <lb/>

            day,—oh, think of it !—I too, rudely seized by Argive hands, <lb/>
            shall have henceforth the portion of a slave,-and thy son <lb/>
            with me. And some one of my masters will gird at me in <lb/>
            bitter phrase, saying, " Behold the concubine of Ajax, once <lb/>
            mightiest man in all the host, what menial tasks are hers in <lb/>
            place of that high bliss ! " On such wise will they talk; and <lb/>
            sorely Fate will vex my life, while on thee and thy race such <lb/>
            words bring shame. Nay, pity thy father, abandoned in his <lb/>
            sad old age; thy mother, with her heritage of weary years, <lb/>
            whose prayer goes up so oft to God that thou come home <lb/>
            alive; thine own son—prince, oh ! pity him ; think of the <lb/>
            cruel fate which thy death will bequeath to him and me, if, <lb/>
            reft of childhood's fostering care, forsaken by thee, he has <lb/>
            to live his orphan life under harsh guardians' eyes! For <lb/>
            I have nought to look to any more save thee. My country <lb/>
            thou didst ruin with the spear; and then a further stroke of <lb/>
            Fate laid low my mother and my sire, that they might dwell <lb/>
            in Hades' house of death. What home, then, can I find but <lb/>
            thee ? What riches have I else ? On thee my safety all <lb/>
            depends. Bethink thee, too, of me. Surely a man should <lb/>
            keep it in his mind, if he hath ever met with aught of joy ! <lb/>
            'Tis kindness aye gives kindness birth. But whoso lets the <lb/>
            memory fade of services received, can pass as noble never­ <lb/>

          <p>AJAX. Approve! Yea, surely she shall find I do, if she <lb/>

            servants.</p>
          <p>AJAX. Then, why this delay in his coming?</p>
          <p>TEC. (calling off the stage). My child, thy father summons <lb/>
            thee. Whoever of you servants is now his guide and guard, <lb/>
            bring him hither.</p>
          <p>AJAX. Doth he obey thy call, or has he failed to catch <lb/>
            thy drift ?</p>
          <p>TEC. Lo ! a servant is e'en now approaching with the <lb/>
            child.</p>
          <p>AJAX. Lift him, lift him hither to me. He will feel no <lb/>
            fear, I trow, at the sight of this fresh-spilt gore,2 if he is <lb/>
            indeed my child,-his own true father's son. At once, <lb/>
            though, must ye break him in ; at once his nature must be <lb/>

          <p>My child, be happier than thy sire, but like him in all <lb/>

            e'en now I have thus much to envy thee,-thou hast no <lb/>

            thee, fostering thy young life, a joy to this thy mother's <lb/>
            heart. No Achæan, I feel sure, will ever put affronts on thee <lb/>
            by acts of dire outrage, e'en though I am not there. So <lb/>
            trusty a warder will I leave to watch over thee, even Teucer, <lb/>

            shall set up arms of mine as prizes for Achæans. Nay, but <lb/>
            for the shield,-from which thou hast thy name, my son <lb/>
            Eurysaces,—let me see thee take it thyself and hold it, <lb/>
            turning it this way and that by its strong-sewn strap,­ <lb/>

            wouldst ever see him yet alive. For to-day, and only to-day, <lb/>
            will the wrath of the goddess Athene torment him." Those <lb/>
            were his words. " Lives o'ergrown and profitless," 1—went <lb/>
            on the seer,—" fall before heavy misfortunes of the gods, <lb/>
            sending, whene'er one born to man's estate is filled with <lb/>
            thoughts beyond man's sphere, despite his birth. Now, yon <lb/>
            Ajax, at his very start from home, was found a witless wight, <lb/>
            although his father gave him sage advice, saying to him, <lb/>
            " My son, be victory thy aim, but always with the help of <lb/>
            God." But he made answer like a braggart fool, "Father, <lb/>
            with help of gods even a man of naught might win him vic­ <lb/>
            tory ; good hope have I to pluck that glorious crown myself <lb/>

            after that, a second time, in answer to the goddess Athene,2 <lb/>
            when she was cheering him on and bidding him turn his <lb/>
            bloodstained hand against the foe, then spake he dreadful <lb/>
            words,-words better left unsaid, " 0 queen, go stand near <lb/>
            others of the Argive host; where I am, shall the battle never <lb/>
            break."3 Such the words whereby he won the dire dis­ <lb/>
            pleasure of the goddess, harbouring thoughts beyond man's <lb/>
            sphere. But, if indeed he is alive this day, haply, with <lb/>
            Heaven's help, we may become his saviours."</p>

            "Teucer hopes to announce (i.e., in time) that this going forth is <lb/>

          <p>TEU. Pray, tell us, then, the reason urged by thee for <lb/>
            this.</p>
          <p>MEN. The reason is,—we thought to bring him from his <lb/>
            home as the Achæans' friend and ally, but found him, when <lb/>
            we came to seek, more hostile than our Phrygian foes ; <lb/>
            seeing that he plotted death for all the host and set forth by <lb/>
            night against it, to slay us with the spear; 1 and, had not <lb/>
            some god quelled this attempt, we should have been most <lb/>
            foully slain and left to lie,-the very fate that hath befallen <lb/>
            him,—while he would have been living still. But, as it was, <lb/>
            God turned from us the outrage he designed, to let it fall on <lb/>
            sheep and herds. Wherefore, as for him, there is none so <lb/>
            mighty as to give his body burial; but he shall be cast forth <lb/>
            on the yellow sand and become a prey for the birds of the <lb/>
            sea. Ne'er suffer, then, dire rage to rise. For, if we could <lb/>
            not rule him when alive, at least we will be masters of him <lb/>
            dead, and force him to our way-e'en though thou like it <lb/>
            not; for while he lived, he ne'er would heed a word I said. <lb/>
            And yet this argues villainy, when a man of the commons <lb/>
            claims to disobey his rulers' bests. Never can the course <lb/>
            of law be smooth in any state, where fear is not a principle; <lb/>
            nor, again, can an army any more be wisely ruled, if it have <lb/>
            not a bulwark of reverence and fear. Nay, but a man, <lb/>
            however great his bulk, should think that he yet may fall <lb/>
            e'en by a trivial hurt. Be sure of this,-the one safe man <lb/>
            is he with whom dwells fear, and, with it, sense of shame; <lb/>
            but where 'tis open to act frowardly and do what seemeth <lb/>
            good to each, that state, believe me, though it have had a <lb/>

            thee; do not then, in spite of them, turn to insult the dead <lb/>

            no birth goes astray for that reason, since those, who are <lb/>
            accounted nobly born, err so deeply in their speech. Come, <lb/>
            tell us once more from the beginning,—dost say that it was <lb/>
            thou who didst find this man and broughtest him hither to <lb/>
            help the Achæans ? Did he not sail of his own accord, as <lb/>
            his own master ? What ground hast thou to captain him ? <lb/>
            Where is thy right to lord it o'er his folk, whom he brought2 <lb/>
            with him from his home? As Sparta's king thou earnest, <lb/>
            not as lord of us. I find no royal prerogative whereby thy <lb/>
            right to govern him exceeds his own to govern thee. Subject <lb/>
            to others thou sailedst hither, not as captain of us all, that <lb/>
            thou should'st ever order Ajax. No ! rule whom rule thou <lb/>
            dost, and keep those haughty words to punish them; but <lb/>
            this man will I bury, as in duty bound, fearing not that <lb/>
            tongue of thine, whether it be thou, or that other chief, that <lb/>
            forbids. Not for thy wife's sake, I trow, did Ajax join the <lb/>
            host, like those who toil so sore,3 but by reason of the oath <lb/>
            which bound him,—not for thee at all; for of those that <note type="footnote"> 1 Linwood would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">λυποίμεθα</foreign>, and so Paley. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤγαγε</foreign>.

          <p>AGA. True, King Odysseus; for have we not just been <lb/>
            hearing words most shameful from this fellow?</p>
          <p>ODY. What words ? I can pardon a man, if, when called <lb/>
            hard names, he retorts with like abuse.</p>
          <p>AGA. I did revile him,—yes; 'twas only what he did <lb/>
            to me.</p>
          <p>ODY. Why, what hath he done to thee, that thou art <lb/>
            really hurt ?</p>
          <p>AGA. He says he will not suffer yon corpse to miss the <lb/>
            meed of burial, but will bury it in spite of me.</p>
          <p>ODY. Well, may thy friend tell out the truth, yet rest thy <lb/>
            friend no less than formerly ?</p>
          <p>AGA. Say on; else1 were I devoid of sense; seeing that I <lb/>
            hold thee my greatest friend among the Argives.</p>
          <p>ODY. Hearken, then. In Heaven's name I pray thee, <lb/>
            that thou harden not thy heart to cast forth so ruthlessly the <lb/>
            corpse of yon man unburied; never let violence prevail with <lb/>
            thee to make thy hate so bitter that thou trample on the <lb/>
            right! To me, too, once was Ajax my most hated foe in all <lb/>
            the host, from the day I made Achilles' arms mine own; <lb/>
            yet, for all his hate of me, never2 would I so dishonour him <lb/>
            as to deny that he was the bravest man I ever saw among <lb/>
            the Argives, of all of us who came to Troy,-save Achilles <lb/>
            only. So it were not right that he should be dishonoured <lb/>
            by thee; for 'tis not he at all, but Heaven's laws that thou <lb/>
            wilt hurt. Now to harm the brave when dead is no righteous <lb/>
            act ;-no ! hate them as one may.</p>
          <p>AGA. Dost thou, Odysseus, fight his cause with me ?</p>
          <p>ODY. I do; and yet I hated him, so long as I might fairly <lb/>
            hate.</p>

            dead?</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE materials for his " Philoctetes " were probably drawn by <lb/>
            Sophocles from the lost epics on the tale of Troy. The details <lb/>
            of the story may be found in the " Posthomerica " of Quintus <lb/>
            Smyrnæus, ix. 327 sqq.</p>
          <p>Philoctetes, the son of Pœas, had inherited the famous bow <lb/>
            and arrows of his friend Heracles, in return for the service he <lb/>
            did that hero in kindling his funeral pyre on Mount CEta. As <lb/>
            one of the suitors of Helen, Philoctetes sailed with the other <lb/>
            chieftains for Troy with seven ships from his native land of <lb/>
            Malis, beneath the shadow of CEta, by the streams of Spercheius ; <lb/>
            but, on the fleet stopping at Chryse, a small island near Lemnos, <lb/>
            to sacrifice by divine command, Philoctetes was bitten in the <lb/>
            foot by a snake, which guarded the sacred precinct of the nymph <lb/>
            Chryse. His wound, seemingly incurable, caused him such awful <lb/>
            agony and became so offensive to his comrades, that, to escape <lb/>
            his piercing screams and the stench of his festering foot, they <lb/>
            followed the advice of the crafty Odysseus and put him ashore, <lb/>
            all alone, on Lemnos. But, in the tenth year of the siege of <lb/>
            Troy, having learnt from their captive, the Trojan prophet <lb/>
            Helenus, that the city could not be taken by them without the <lb/>
            bow of Heracles being brought against it, they sent Odysseus <lb/>
            with Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, to Lemnos to obtain it <lb/>
            from Philoctetes.</p>
          <p>It is at this point the play opens. Odysseus and his young <lb/>
            comrade have landed on the desert shore of Lemnos, and <lb/>
            Odysseus is describing the exact spot, where, in obedience to <lb/>
            the general wish,-as he is careful to add,-he had put Philoctetes <lb/>
            ashore ten years previously,-his presence in the Achæan host <lb/>
             <pb n="384"/>
            having been rendered intolerable by the effects of the snake-bite <lb/>
            in his foot. Neoptolemus, being unknown to Philoctetes, who <lb/>
            would naturally resent any advances on the part of Odysseus, is <lb/>
            sent on by the latter to find the sufferer's cave, while Odysseus <lb/>
            remains hidden, after posting a scout to keep watch lest Philoc­ <lb/>
            tetes should come upon them unawares. The cave is easily <lb/>
            found ; Philoctetes is not there, but the evidences of his fearful <lb/>
            malady are only too manifest. (11. 1-49.)</p>
          <p>Odysseus then proceeds to unfold his plot for capturing <lb/>
            Philoctetes ; it will be necessary, he says, to use guile ; Neop­ <lb/>
            tolemus must say that he too has suffered at the hands of the <lb/>
            Atreidæ and Odysseus, and so gain the confidence of Philoctetes <lb/>
            the bow must be obtained somehow; questions of right and <lb/>
            wrong can wait; everything, after all, is right which is expedient; <lb/>
            so argues Odysseus.</p>
          <p>Neoptolemus at first indignantly refuses to dirty his lips with <lb/>
            a lie, but at length he is persuaded into believing that the <lb/>
            interests of the Achæans come first; Troy cannot fall without <lb/>
            the bow of Heracles, and Neoptolemus, its fated conqueror, will <lb/>
            fail unless he can persuade Philoctetes to yield. (11. 50-134.) <lb/>
            Odysseus then disappears, and Neoptolemus instructs the Chorus <lb/>
            how they are to help him. Meantime, Philoctetes is heard in <lb/>
            the distance, heralded by moans of anguish. (11. 135-217.) <lb/>
            Entering with slow and painful steps, he learns on inquiry who <lb/>
            his visitors are, Neoptolemus adding that he and his men are on <lb/>
            their way to Scyros from Troy. Philoctetes rejoices to find they <lb/>
            are from Hellas ; but do they not know him? It seems not; so <lb/>
            he tells his story,-how he had been cast ashore by Odysseus, and <lb/>
            the pitiful life he has since led on lonely Lemnos. (11. 218-316.) <lb/>
            Neoptolemus expresses his compassion and says that he too has <lb/>
            good cause to loathe Odysseus and the Atreidae for cheating <lb/>
            him of his father's arms after entreating him to come to Troy to <lb/>
            their aid (11. 317-377); indignant at this treatment, he has left <lb/>
            Troy and is on his way home. The Chorus confirm this story, and <lb/>
            Philoctetes exhibits a generous sympathy.</p>
          <p>Then ensues a long talk about the fate of various warriors at' <lb/>
            Troy ; after which Neoptolemus expresses his intention of sailing <lb/>
            away. (11. 378-465.) The thought of being left alone again calls <lb/>
            forth an impassioned appeal from Philoctetes. " Will not <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            Neoptolemus spare him one passing thought ? Has he nowhere <lb/>
            he can stow him for the short voyage home ? It is not much to <lb/>
            grant, and a good deed is its own reward." The Chorus add <lb/>
            their entreaties, and Neoptolemus is on the point of consenting, <lb/>
            when two strangers are seen approaching. (11. 466-541.) These <lb/>
            are a merchant,—(really an emissary of Odysseus in disguise),­ <lb/>
            and a sailor. The former declares himself to be a trader between <lb/>
            Peparethus and Troy with wine for the Achaean army; he has <lb/>
            learnt something that may interest Neoptolemus, and has come <lb/>
            out of his way to tell him that the Atreidæ have sent to bring <lb/>
            him back by force ; and, further, he adds incidentally that <lb/>
            Odysseus and Diomedes are gone in quest of Philoctetes, <lb/>
            whose presence at Troy is necessary for their success ; this they <lb/>
            have learnt from the Trojan prophet Helenus. (II. 542-627.) <lb/>
            After the exit of the merchant, Philoctetes is more anxious than <lb/>
            ever to start, before Odysseus can reach Lemnos ; and, though <lb/>
            Neoptolemus points out that the wind is against them, he gains <lb/>
            his point and enters his cave to collect his few treasures. (11. <lb/>
            628-675.) The Chorus meantime chant an ode on the awful <lb/>
            sufferings of this lonely man, contrasting them with the happier <lb/>
            life now before him (11. 676-729); but, before Philoctetes can <lb/>
            start, he is attacked by a fearful paroxysm of pain ; unable to <lb/>
            control himself, he implores Neoptolemus to stay by him, at <lb/>
            the same time handing him the bow and arrows to keep till the <lb/>
            fit is past; at last he falls asleep from sheer exhaustion, and the <lb/>
            Chorus, after singing a short hymn of exquisite beauty to the <lb/>
            god of sleep (11. 730-832), when they see him safely asleep, <lb/>
            counsel departure without him ; but Neoptolemus tells them that <lb/>
            the bow without its master is useless. (II. 833-864.)</p>
          <p>Philoctetes awakes and thanks his watchers in pathetic <lb/>
            language for having stayed loyally by him in his helplessness ; <lb/>
            he is anxious to be going without more delay, but now it is <lb/>
            Neoptolemus who hangs back; there is something on his mind; <lb/>
            he parries the other's questions feebly for awhile, but finally <lb/>
            confesses that Troy, not Scyros, is their destination. (11.865-915.) <lb/>
            The despair and indignation of Philoctetes are terrible. To <lb/>
            think that he has trusted this youth, who seemed so guileless, <lb/>
            only to find himself heartlessly duped I His bow is gone ; he is <lb/>
            helpless. Abuse, remonstrance, entreaty succeed one another,­ <note type="footnote"> cc </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="386"/>
            and not without effect. Neoptolemus is ashamed of himself, and <lb/>
            is on the point of giving back the bow and renouncing the rôle <lb/>
            he is playing, when Odysseus suddenly appears from a place of <lb/>
            concealment and forbids any such sentimental weakness (11. 916- <lb/>
            980), adding that Philoctetes must come to Troy whether he will <lb/>
            or no. " It is the will of Zeus." Hereupon Philoctetes tries to throw <lb/>
            himself over a precipice, but Odysseus prevents his design ; <lb/>
            failing in this, he curses the son of Laertes bitterly and taunts <lb/>
            him with cowardice in days gone by. To this Odysseus deigns <lb/>
            no reply, beyond retorting mockingly that Philoctetes shall have <lb/>
            his own way and remain in Lemnos ; there is no need of hint <lb/>
            now that they have his bow. This is of course merely a feint to <lb/>
            frighten Philoctetes, for they know they cannot dispense with <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Pretending now to leave him for good, Odysseus retires, <lb/>
            taking Neoptolemus and the bow with him ; while the Chorus <lb/>
            remains awhile, in the hope that Philoctetes may change his <lb/>
            mind, before they actually sail. (11. 981-1080.) The poor wretch <lb/>
            now resigns himself to despair ; but the Chorus points out that it <lb/>
            is he, after all, who is to blame for prolonging his own sufferings ; <lb/>
            a chance of escape is offered him ; Odysseus is merely the envoy <lb/>
            of others. But Philoctetes can only dwell on his wrongs, and <lb/>
            all entreaties to him to yield are fruitless ; so they begin to <lb/>
            withdraw, when he suddenly recalls them (11. 1081-1190), craving <lb/>
            their pardon for any hasty words he may have let fall, and at <lb/>
            the same time imploring them to give him some weapon, with <lb/>
            which to destroy his miserable life. They are still arguing with <lb/>
            him, when Neoptolemus enters hurriedly, closely pursued by <lb/>
            Odysseus. The young man has come to make amends, if <lb/>
            possible, for the past,-to restore the bow, and fulfil his promise <lb/>
            to carry Philoctetes home. Odysseus expostulates and blusters, <lb/>
            but eventually quits the stage, vowing to tell the host of this <lb/>
            treachery. (11. 1191-1262.)</p>
          <p>Philoctetes, having heard their loud tones, is coming out <lb/>
            from his cave, when he sees Neoptolemus, and, suspecting <lb/>
            further villainy, begins to hurry back. Neoptolemus reassures <lb/>
            him, and at last overcomes his incredulity and indignation by <lb/>
            restoring him his bow, just as Odysseus, suddenly reappearing, <lb/>
            makes a vain attempt to prevent the restitution ; but he is too <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            late this time, and, except for the prompt interference of Neopto­ <lb/>
            lemus, would have paid the forfeit of his life to one of the <lb/>
            fatal shafts of Philoctetes. (11. 1263-1304.) His lucky escape fills <lb/>
            the latter with vexation, and in this irritable state Neoptolemus <lb/>
            makes a last effort to persuade him to come to Troy, where his <lb/>
            wound shall be cured and his glory assured. But Philoctetes is <lb/>
            obdurate ; he fears the future even more than he resents the past, <lb/>
            and he claims the fulfilment of the promise Neoptolemus had <lb/>
            given to take him home. Neoptolemus consents ; and it seems <lb/>
            as if oracles and destiny are to be set at defiance, when the <lb/>
            divine form of Heracles is seen hovering above them ; and from <lb/>
            the god's lips they learn that it is indeed heaven's will that <lb/>
            Philoctetes should go to Troy, there to find health and fame <lb/>
            immortal. Thus is a reconciliation effected ; Philoctetes accepts <lb/>
            his destiny ; and the play closes as all are preparing to start for <lb/>
            the ship. (11. 1305-1471.)</p><pb n="388"/>

          <p>ODY. This is the shore of the sea-girt land of Lemnos, <lb/>
            untrodden of mortals, uninhabited. Here, long ago, 0 <lb/>
            Neoptolemus,—thou son of Achilles, sprung of noblest sire <lb/>
            in Hellas,—I landed that Malian, the son of Pœas,—com­ <lb/>
            missioned to this deed by those who were my chiefs,-his <lb/>
            foot discharging from a gnawing sore; seeing that we could <lb/>
            neither engage in drink-offering or sacrifice undisturbed, but <lb/>
            he, with his wild curses, would ever fill the whole camp, <lb/>
            crying out and uttering moan. But why need I tell of this? <lb/>
            Enough ! 'tis no time for us to make long speeches, lest he <lb/>
            even learn that I am come, and so I spoil the whole clever <lb/>
            scheme, whereby I think to take him out of hand. Nay, <lb/>
            'tis thy task now to help in what remains, and to seek where <lb/>
            hereabouts there is a rocky cave with two-fold mouth, so <lb/>
            placed that there in winter's cold there is a seat at either <lb/>
            door to catch the sun, while in summer-time a breeze wafts <lb/>
            slumber through the rock-pierced cave. A little way below, <lb/>
            upon the left, thou mayst chance to spy a drinking-fount, if <lb/>
            haply it is still unchoked.</p>
          <p>Prithee, make thy way in silence thither and give me a <lb/>

            from both of us in concert.</p>
          <p>NEO. King Odysseus, the task thou namest lies close by; <lb/>
            for I see, methinks, a cave that answers thy description.</p>
          <p>ODY. Above thee or below ? I see it not.</p>
          <p>NEO. There it is, above me; no sound of footsteps, no.</p>
          <p>ODY. Take care he be not quartered there asleep.</p>
          <p>NEO. I see an empty habitation,-no man in it.</p>
          <p>ODY. And no provision either for human habitation <lb/>
            inside ?</p>
          <p>NEO. Yes, a bed of leaves, pressed down, as for a man <lb/>
            who lodgeth here.</p>
          <p>ODY. Is all else desolate? nought but this beneath the <lb/>
            roof?</p>
          <p>NEO. There is a cup of mere rough wood, fashioned by <lb/>
            some indifferent craftsman, and here with it the means for <lb/>
            kindling fire.</p>
          <p>ODY. 'Tis his! this store thou art describing.</p>
          <p>NEO. (With a gesture of disgust.) Ha ! here are rags <lb/>
            likewise, drying in the sun, tainted by some grievous running <lb/>
            sore.</p>
          <p>ODY. Our man dwells here in this spot undoubtedly, and <lb/>
            he is somewhere not far hence; for how could a man go any <lb/>
            way with that long-standing disease in his foot ?</p>
          <p>No, either he has gone forth in quest of food, or to find <lb/>
            some easeful leaf, which he mayhap hath somewhere noted. <lb/>
            So send him, that is with thee, to keep an outlook, lest he <lb/>
            even surprise me unawares; for he would rather catch me <lb/>
            than all the Argives.</p>
          <p>NEO. Well, there he goes, and the path shall be guarded ; <lb/>
            and now, if thou art anxious to tell me aught, say on.</p>
          <p>ODY. Son of Achilles, thou must show thy noble spirit on <lb/>
            this quest, not with body only, but, if thou hear aught new, <lb/>
            of which thou hast not heard before, thou must assist in it; <lb/>
            for thou art here to help.</p><pb n="390"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[L. 54-92"/>
          <p>NEO. What can thy bidding be?</p>
          <p>ODY. 'Tis thy duty to beguile the heart of Philoctetes <lb/>
            with words, in talking to him. When he asks thee who thou <lb/>
            art and whence thou earnest, say, " I am Achilles' son;" <lb/>
            there must be no deception here ; but thou art sailing home­ <lb/>
            ward, and hast left Achæa's naval host, filled with .mighty <lb/>
            hate of them, for that they made thee leave thy home by <lb/>
            urgent prayers,-their only means of capturing Ilium,-and <lb/>
            yet deigned not to give thee the arms of Achilles at thy <lb/>
            coming, though thou didst claim them by right; but they <lb/>
            handed them over to Odysseus. Of me say what thou wilt, <lb/>
            the foulest of abuse; thou wilt not pain me thus at all. <lb/>
            But if thou do not this, thou wilt fling the brand of sorrow <lb/>
            into each Argive heart; for unless yon sufferer's bow be <lb/>
            captured, thou canst never waste the land of Dardanus. <lb/>
            And now attend; there is a reason why thy intercourse <lb/>
            with him deserves his trust and keeps thee safe, while mine <lb/>
            would not. Thou didst sail unfettered by oath to any, and <lb/>
            without compulsion, not sharing in that first-sent armament; <lb/>
            while Icannot say no to aught of this. Wherefore, should <lb/>
            he mark me here, whilst still the bow is in his power, I am <lb/>
            undone, and I shall be thy ruin too if found with thee. <lb/>
            Nay, this is the very point our craft must compass, how thou <lb/>
            art to steal those arms invincible.</p>
          <p>Full well, my son, I know 'tis not thy nature to utter or <lb/>
            contrive a sorry trick like this ; yet, since the prize of victory <lb/>
            is something sweet to win, constrain thyself; hereafter will <lb/>
            we show the world our honesty; but now give up thyself to <lb/>
            me for one brief day of roguery; and then, for all the days <lb/>
            to come, be called the world's most upright son.</p>
          <p>NEO. Son of Laertes, I abhor to carry out proposals I <lb/>
            am pained to hear; mine is no nature to do anything by <lb/>
            evil means; I am not such myself, nor was my sire, they <lb/>
            say. Nay, I am ready to carry off our man by force, not by <lb/>
            fraud; yea, for he will not master all our number by force, <pb n="391"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 93-117]"/> <lb/>
            with his one foot. Still, as I was sent to share thy task, I <lb/>
            shrink from the name of traitor\ but I would rather do the <lb/>
            right, 0 king, and fail, than win the day by wrong.</p>
          <p>ODY. Scion of a gallant sire, I too was once as young <lb/>
            myself, and then I had a sluggard tongue, a ready hand; <lb/>
            but now, when I step forth to test the world, I find it is the <lb/>
            tongue, not deeds, that men let take the lead in everything.</p>
          <p>NEO. Thou bid'st me tell a lie,—a lie, what else?</p>
          <p>ODY. Take Philoctetes by guile is what I tell thee.</p>
          <p>NEO. And why need we lead him hence by guile rather <lb/>
            than by persuasion ?</p>
          <p>ODY. He will never hearken; nor couldst thou take him <lb/>
            by force.</p>
          <p>NEO. Has he then such strange reliance in his strength?</p>
          <p>ODY. Arrows he hath that none may 'scape, messengers <lb/>
            of death.</p>
          <p>NEO. May no one even venture to approach him then ?</p>
          <p>ODY. None, save he catch him thus by guile, as I tell <lb/>
            thee.</p>
          <p>NEO. Pray dost thou deem it no disgrace to utter lies ?</p>
          <p>ODY. None, if but the falsehood carries safety.</p>
          <p>NEO. Well, but how shall a man dare to look his fellow <lb/>
            in the face and boldly say such things ?</p>
          <p>ODY. It is not well to shrink, when thou art doing aught <lb/>
            for gain.</p>
          <p>NEO. What gain to me is, his coming to Troy?</p>
          <p>ODY. That bow and that alone takes Troy.</p>
          <p>NEO. Then 'tis not I who am to sack the town, as ye <lb/>
            were used to say ?</p>
          <p>ODY. Not thou without that bow, nor yet the bow apart <lb/>
            from thee.</p>
          <p>NEO. Why then, if that is really so, the bow were worth <lb/>
            the quest.</p>
          <p>ODY. Know that by doing only this, thou gainest two <lb/>
            rewards.</p><pb n="392"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[L. 118-147"/>
          <p>NEO. What are they? When I know that, I will not <lb/>
            refuse the deed.</p>
          <p>ODY. Thou wilt win the name of good and wise at once.</p>
          <p>NEO. So be it: farewell to every sense of shame ! I'll do <lb/>
            the deed.</p>
          <p>ODY. Well then, dost thou remember the advice I gave <lb/>
            thee?</p>
          <p>NEO. Rest well assured I do, when once I have agreed.</p>
          <p>ODY. Abide then here thyself and wait for him, and I will <lb/>
            go away that I be not seen with thee, and I will send our <lb/>
            watcher back to the ship. Likewise, if ye seem to me to <lb/>
            tarry at all beyond the time, I will send back to thee here <lb/>
            this self-same man, craftily disguising him to represent the <lb/>
            master of a ship, that ignorance of who he is may also aid <lb/>
            our plan; and then, my son, when he tells a crafty tale, <lb/>
            take what suits thy purpose ever and anon from what he says.</p>

            Hermes, lord of guile, men's guide upon their way, be <lb/>

            tailing saviour. (Exit ODYSSEUS.)</p>

            tell to him whose mind suspecteth all,-a stranger I in <lb/>
            strangers' land; for his art exceeds all other art, his judg­ <lb/>

            what service I must render thee.</p>

            the years dragged on; and all alone 'neath this cramped <lb/>
            roof I had to do each menial office for myself. Yon bow <lb/>
            would aye procure sufficient for my belly, shooting the <lb/>
            feathered doves; but whatever my shaft on the tightened <lb/>
            string might shoot me, to this I would crawl myself, un­ <lb/>
            happy wretch, dragging my suffering foot so far; likewise, if <lb/>
            I needed a draught of water, or, haply, when the hoar-frost <lb/>
            was spread abroad, as happeneth in the winter, if there was <lb/>
            firewood to break, I would creep out, ah me ! and compass <lb/>
            it; next there would be no fire, but by long rubbing of two <lb/>
            stones together I made the light appear at last, which lurks <lb/>
            unseen therein; and this is e'en what keeps me living on <lb/>

          <p>Come now, my son, thou next shalt learn the nature of <lb/>
            the island. Hither draws no sailor nigh of his own free-will; <lb/>
            for there is no roadstead here, nor any port of call where he <lb/>
            will drive a gainful trade or be a welcome guest; such as are <lb/>
            prudent amongst mortals make no voyages hither. Maybe <lb/>

            often happen in the long course of human history; well, <lb/>

            victim of a shaft which Phoebus aimed;-so runs the tale.</p>

            This, good sir, was'how they told the tale, causing me no <lb/>
            long delay ere I started in haste on my voyage, first because <lb/>
            I yearned towards my dead sire, to see him ere his burial, <lb/>
            for I had never seen him yet; and then, no doubt, the tale <lb/>
            they told had added its glamour, if by my going I should <lb/>
            take Troy's coronal of towers. My voyage was entering on <lb/>
            its second day, when I, with oar and breeze to help, was <lb/>
            running into cruel Sigeum; and, straightway when I landed, <lb/>
            all the host came thronging round to welcome me, swearing <lb/>
            that they saw Achilles, who was dead, alive again. Nay, <lb/>
            there he lay, a corpse; and I, his luckless son, when I had <lb/>
            shed a tear for him, without delay went to the sons of <lb/>
            Atreus,—to friends, as I had right to think, and claimed <lb/>
            from them my father's arms and whatso else was his. But <lb/>
            they answered—(Out upon their brazen words !): " Off­ <lb/>
            spring of Achilles, all else that was thy sire's thou art free <lb/>
            to take, but those famed arms of his,-another chieftain is <lb/>
            lord of them now, even the son of Laertes."</p>
          <p>The tears sprang to my eyes as I leapt to my feet in a <lb/>
            fury of passion; and, stung to the quick, " Thou wretch !”I <lb/>
            cried. "What, have ye dared to give the arms, that are mine, <lb/>
            to some other instead of me, ere ye had learnt my will ? "</p>
          <p>Then spake Odysseus,—for he stood near by chance,­ <lb/>
            "Yea, boy, they have done rightly in giving me these <lb/>
            arms; for it was I who saved both them and yonder corpse <lb/>
            by being there." At once then, with a burst of fury, I flung <lb/>
            at him a torrent of abuse, leaving nought I knew unsaid, if <lb/>
            he should rob me of the arms that were my own. Then he, <lb/>
            thus put to it, stung at what he heard, albeit slow to wrath, <lb/>
            made answer thus : " Thou wert not there with us, but thou <lb/>
            wert absent at no proper time;1 and for these arms,-since <lb/>
            thou hast e'en so pert a tongue,-be sure thou shalt ne'er <lb/>

            tell me of thy whereabouts; since I have crossed thy path, <lb/>

            anchored off the same shore. Sailing as a merchant with a <lb/>
            small crew homeward from Ilium, to Peparethus rich in <lb/>
            vines, on hearing that the sailors were all thy shipmates,2 I <lb/>

            I had had speech of thee, and obtained due recompensed <lb/>
            Thou knowest nought, it seems, of what concerns thee, of <lb/>
            those new schemes the Argives have concerning thee,-not <lb/>
            merely schemes, but deeds already doing, no longer left <lb/>

            him back either by words of persuasion or by exercise of <lb/>

            for he felt more confident of succeeding than his fellow.</p>
          <p>NEo. But why, after this long while, were the sons of <lb/>
            Atreus troubling themselves so exceedingly about this man, <lb/>
            seeing that they have cast him forth these many years? <lb/>
            What strange longing came to them, or what constraint and <lb/>
            vengeance from those gods, who requite ill deeds?</p>
          <p>MER. Myself will tell thee that in full; for maybe thou <lb/>
            hast not heard it. There was a certain prophet, nobly born, <lb/>
            a son of Priam, Helenus by name; him this fellow captured, <lb/>
            going forth alone by night,-crafty, Odysseus, who is called by <lb/>
            every shameful and insulting name; and, bringing him in a <lb/>
            prisoner, he displayed him in the sight of the Achæans, a <lb/>
            fine prize. He it was who, after foretelling everything to <lb/>
            his cantors, added this as well: " Ye shall never sack the <lb/>
            towers that look o'er Troy, unless ye first persuade yon man <lb/>
            by argument and bring him with you from that isle, whereon <lb/>
            he dwells to-day."</p>
          <p>And the son of Laertes, as soon as he had heard the seer's <lb/>
            words, forthwith engaged to bring this man and show him <lb/>
            to the Achæans; " probably, I think," said he, " taking him <lb/>
            of his own freewill; if not,-why, then, against it;" and, <lb/>
            should he fail in this, who would might take his head with <lb/>
            his full leave..</p>
          <p>I have told thee all, my son; " make haste " is the warning <lb/>
            I give, no less to thee thyself than to any thou carest for.</p>
          <p>PHI. Ah, woe is me ! Hath he, that utter bane, sworn to <lb/>

          <p>PHI. Strange, boy, is it not, for the son of Laertes to have <lb/>
            hoped that his soft words would ever be the means of taking <lb/>
            me hence and bringing me forth from his ship to show <lb/>
            amongst the Argives? No ! sooner would I hearken to my <lb/>
            most deadliest of foes, the snake which crippled me thus. <lb/>
            But that man can say anything, dare anything; he will be <lb/>
            here e'en now, I know. Let us away, my son, that there <lb/>
            may be a broad stretch of sea parting us from the ship of <lb/>

          <p>PHI. This is the bow, no other; yea, this that I am <lb/>
            carrying.</p>
          <p>NEO. Might I take a view of it quite close, and hold it in <lb/>

            power of gazing on yon sun-god's light, of seeing the CEtaean <lb/>

            Fear not; thou shalt have the bow to handle withal and <lb/>
            then restore to the giver, and thine shall the proud boast be, <lb/>
            that, for thy goodness, thou alone of mortal men hast touched <lb/>
            it ; for it was e'en by a kind service that I obtained it <lb/>
            myself.1</p>

            a friend; yea, for whoso knoweth how to repay kindness <lb/>
            with kindness will prove a friend beyond all other getting. <lb/>

            however he in his solitude, with the sound of the billows <lb/>
            breaking round him, held fast, as it seems he has, to a life <lb/>
            so pitiable; where he had no neighbour but himself,' with­ <lb/>
            out the power of walking, and not a dweller in the land to <lb/>

            no reason I for wrath or complaint against me.</p>

            the living as now amongst the dead.</p>
          <p>NEO. To hear thee praise my father and myself is joy to <lb/>
            me; but hear what I desire to win from thee. The strokes <lb/>
            of fortune Heaven deals out to man, he needs must bear; <lb/>

            thou hatest him, thinking him a foe and ill-disposed. Still <lb/>
            will I speak ; be witness, Zeus, the lord of oaths; and do <lb/>
            thou learn this and write it within thy heart. This anguish <lb/>
            thou sufferest is of Heaven's sending, because thou didst <lb/>
            approach the guardian of Chryse, the serpent which keepeth <lb/>

            ease from this complaint; when, aided by this bow and me, <lb/>
            thou wilt appear as the sacker of Troy's towers.</p>
          <p>How I know that is so, I will tell thee. We have with us <lb/>
            a prisoner from Troy, Helenus, a prince of prophets; he <lb/>
            tells us clearly that so it must be, and, what is more, that <lb/>
            Troy must be uttterly o'erthrown this very summer; if not, <lb/>
            he willingly puts his life in our hands, in case his words <lb/>
            prove false.</p>
          <p>So then, since thou now knowest this, consent to yield; <lb/>
            for the further gain is an honourable one,-first, after being <lb/>
            judged the very best of the sons of Hellas, to come into <lb/>
            healing hands, and then, by taking Troy, that town of tears, <lb/>
            to win a fame beyond compare.</p>

            on earth, instead of letting me go hence to Hades' halls? Ah <lb/>
            me ! what can I do ? How can I mistrust his words ? He <lb/>
            counsels me with good intent. Well, am I then to yield ? <lb/>
            How, if I do, shall I face the public gaze, poor wretch? By <lb/>
            whom shall I be greeted ? 0 eyes 1 that have witnessed all <lb/>
            that has happened to me, how will ye endure the sight of me <lb/>
            consorting with the sons of Atreus, my destroyers, or with <lb/>
            that child of perdition, the son of Laertes ? Nay, it is not <lb/>
            the pain of the past that pricks me, but the kind of treatment <lb/>
            I think I yet foresee at their hands; for where the heart hath <lb/>
            once given birth to iniquity, it teaches the rest of its brood <lb/>
            to be evil.2 In thy case, too, I am filled with wonder at <lb/>
